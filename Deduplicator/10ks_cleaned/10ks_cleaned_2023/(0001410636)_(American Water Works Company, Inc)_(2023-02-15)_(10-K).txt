Financial Results
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $4.51, $6.95 and $3.91, respectively. The 2021 financial results included a pre-tax gain of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS and a $45 million pre-tax contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation, a consolidated net impact of $2.70 diluted earnings per share. After excluding the gain related to the sale of HOS and charitable contribution in 2021, diluted earnings per share increased $0.26 in 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment and acquisitions, as well as organic growth, offset somewhat by impacts from inflationary pressures on production costs and higher interest costs along with higher depreciation expenses from the growth of the business. Results for 2022 also reflect the favorable impact of weather, estimated at $0.06 per share, primarily due to hot and dry weather in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to a $0.02 per share favorable impact in 2021. Also, included in the results for 2022 are $0.24 per share from interest income earned on the seller note and income earned on revenue share agreements, which compares to HOS operating results for 2021 of $0.31 per share. Lastly, the operating results for the Company’s New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022, were $0.12 per share in 2021. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Growth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions
The Company continues to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers. In 2022, the Company invested $2.6 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:
Regulated Businesses Growth and Optimization
•$2.3 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the substantial majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and
•$315 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 70,000 customers during 2022, in addition to approximately 18,500 customers added through organic growth during 2022. This includes the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary’s acquisition of the wastewater system assets from the York City Sewer Authority and the City of York on May 27, 2022, for a cash purchase price of $235 million, $20 million of which was funded as a deposit to the seller in April 2021 in connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement.
On October 11, 2022, the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer Authority for a total purchase price of $232 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement. This system provides wastewater service for approximately 14,700 customer connections. The Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval.
On March 29, 2021, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City for $22 million. The water and wastewater systems currently serve approximately 1,500 customers each, or 3,000 combined, and are being sold through the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act process. The Company expects to close this acquisition in early 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements for 21 pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, including the two agreements discussed above, to add approximately 32,400 additional customers.
Sale of Homeowner Services Group
On December 9, 2021, the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised the Company’s HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the “Buyer”), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in pre-tax gain of $748 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. The consideration was comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. See Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information for additional information relating to the seller promissory note and contingent cash payment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded post-close adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which is included in Gain on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The Company recognized $50 million of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the seller note.

The Company and the Buyer also entered into revenue share agreements, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated from customers who are billed for home warranty services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an “on-bill” arrangement), and 15% of the revenue generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unless earlier terminated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods. The Company recognized $9 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2022, from the revenue share agreements, which is included in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.
On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Sale of Michigan American Water Company
On February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for $6 million in cash.
Future Growth
The Company expects to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion over the next five years, and between $30 billion to $34 billion over the next 10 years, including $2.9 billion in 2023. The Company’s expected future investments include:
•capital investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses between $12.5 billion to $13 billion over the next five years, and between $27 billion to $30 billion over the next 10 years, including $2.5 billion expected in 2023; and
•growth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Company’s water and wastewater customer base of between $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next five years, and between $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 10 years, including $400 million expected in 2023.
Presented in the following chart is the estimated allocation of the Company’s expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its Regulated Businesses over the next five years, by purpose:

Other Matters
Military Services Group
On June 30, 2022, MSG was awarded a contract for the ownership, operation, maintenance and replacement of the wastewater utility system assets at Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida. The contract was effective July 1, 2022, and its total revenue is approximately $341 million over a 50-year period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment. The performance start date for operation is scheduled for March 1, 2023. MSG operates and maintains water and/or wastewater systems and related capital programs as part of the U.S. government’s Utilities Privatization Program. This contract represents the 18th installation in MSG’s footprint and the first contract with respect to a U.S. Navy installation.
Permanganate Supply Disruption
In January 2023, a fire occurred at a plant owned by the sole supplier of permanganate in the Western Hemisphere, which has severely limited the U.S. supply of potassium and sodium permanganate, two chemicals used by water utilities to treat water. The Company is seeking to utilize alternative methods of treatment and to manage its existing supplies of permanganate, but any inability to source sufficient quantities of these chemicals or utilize alternative chemicals may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements.

Operational Excellence
The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio was 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs.
The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the amortization of the EADIT. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The items discussed above were excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.
The Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Company’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Company’s adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On December 15, 2022, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case filed on February 10, 2022, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. As updated in the Illinois subsidiary’s June 29, 2022 rebuttal filing, the request sought $83 million in additional annualized revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The general rate case order approved a $67 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges, effective January 1, 2023, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $1.64 billion, a common equity ratio of 49.0% and a debt ratio of 51.0%. The annualized revenue increase is being driven primarily by significant water and wastewater system capital investments since the Illinois subsidiary’s 2017 rate case order that have been completed or are planned through December 31, 2023, expected higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs.
On December 8, 2022, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint settlement of the rate case filed on April 29, 2022, by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $138 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues and authorizes implementation of the new water and wastewater rates effective January 28, 2023. The rate case proceeding was resolved through a “black box” settlement agreement and did not specify an approved return on equity (“ROE”). The annualized revenue increase is driven primarily by significant incremental capital investments since the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s 2021 rate case order that will be completed through December 31, 2023, increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. The general rate case order also includes recovery of the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary’s COVID-19 deferral balance.
On August 17, 2022, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary was authorized additional annual revenues of $46 million in its general rate case, effective September 1, 2022, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.6%, authorized rate base of $4.15 billion, a common equity ratio of 54.6% and a long-term debt ratio of 45.4%. The request incorporated updated estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. Beginning January 1, 2023, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary will defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, the difference between its pension expense and other postretirement benefits expense and those amounts included in base rates. The deferral period for this regulatory asset or liability will be two years or, if earlier, will end at the conclusion of the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s next general rate case. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary also withdrew its request, without prejudice, to recover its existing authorized COVID-19-related regulatory asset in the general rate case and will seek recovery in a separate proceeding within the process established in the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ (the “NJBPU”) generic COVID-19-related proceeding.

On February 24, 2022, WVAWC was authorized additional annual revenues of $13 million in its general rate case, effective February 25, 2022, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.8%, authorized rate base of $734 million and a common equity ratio of 47.9%. Staff of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia moved for reconsideration of the final order on several grounds. WVAWC filed its response to the Staff's Petition for Reconsideration on March 28, 2022, in support of the authorized revenue requirement. On October 21, 2022, the Public Service Commission of West Virginia denied the motion for reconsideration.
Pending General Rate Case Filings
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an increase in 2024 revenue of $56 million and a total increase in revenue over the 2024 to 2026 period of $95 million, with all increases compared against 2022 revenues. The Company updated its filing in January 2023 to capture the authorized step increase effective January 1, 2023. The filing was also updated to incorporate a decoupling proposal and a revision to the Company’s sales and associated variable expense forecast. The revised requested additional annualized revenues for the test year 2024 is now $37 million, compared against 2023 revenues. This excludes the proposed step rate and attrition rate increase for 2025 and 2026 of $20 million and $19 million, respectively. The total revenue requirement request for the three-year rate case cycle, incorporating updates to present rate revenues and forecasted demand, is $76 million.
On July 1, 2022, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $105 million in additional annualized revenues.
On November 15, 2021, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $14 million in additional annualized revenues. Interim rates were effective on May 1, 2022, and the difference between interim and final approved rates is subject to refund. On September 26, 2022, a settlement agreement, supported by all parties except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for a $11 million annual revenue increase. Public hearings were held on September 27 and 28, 2022. A final decision on this matter is expected in the first quarter of 2023.
The Company’s California subsidiary submitted its application on May 3, 2021, to set its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. According to the CPUC’s procedural schedule, a decision setting the authorized cost of capital is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2023.
Infrastructure Surcharges
A number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2022:

Other Regulatory Matters
In September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that required the Company’s California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUC’s denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of review for the Company’s California subsidiary’s petition and the petitions filed by other entities challenging the decision. Independent of the judicial challenge, California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022, and became effective on January 1, 2023. In response to the legislation, on January 27, 2023, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an updated application requesting the CPUC to consider a Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism in its pending 2022 general rate case, which would be effective 2024 through 2026.
On March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the NJBPU that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfield’s water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJ’s initial decision without modification. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. The Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed its brief in support of the appeal on March 4, 2022. Response and Reply briefs were filed on June 22, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPU’s order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Segment Results of Operations
The Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. Other primarily includes MSG, which does not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP. Other also includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment, interest income related to the seller promissory note and income from the revenue share agreement from the sale of HOS, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and fair value adjustments related to acquisitions that have not been allocated to the Regulated Businesses segment. This presentation is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. For a discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial statements for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please refer to Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2022.
As a result of the sale of HOS, the categories which were previously shown as “Market-Based Businesses” and “Other” have been combined and shown as Other. Segment results for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this change.

Included in production costs for 2021, was $8 million related to the Company’s New York operations. Excluding the Company’s New York operations, for 2022, production costs increased $42 million, primarily due to inflationary pressures which resulted in increased fuel, power and chemical costs.
Customer Billing and Accounting
In 2022, as compared to 2021, customer billing and accounting decreased $7 million primarily due to the sale of the Company’s New York operations and lower uncollectible customer accounts expense.
Other
In 2022, as compared to 2021, other increased $10 million primarily due to increase to the insurance other than group reserve which had an unfavorable claims experience compared to prior year.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2022, as compared to 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $32 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and acquisitions.
General Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, general taxes decreased $37 million, primarily related to the sale of the Company’s New York operations.
Other Income (Expense)
In 2022, as compared to 2021, other expenses increased $25 million primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of an $800 million long-term debt issuance in May 2022 and higher interest rates on short-term debt due to macroeconomic market conditions.
Provision for Income Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, the Regulated Businesses’ provision for income taxes increased $16 million. The Regulated Businesses’ effective income tax rate was 18.0% and 17.9% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT due to the completion of stub period amortization, pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with reductions in revenue.

Gain on Sale of Businesses
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS. In 2022, the Company recorded post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital, of pre-tax income of $20 million, which increased the total gain related to the sale of HOS. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Provision for Income Taxes
In 2022, as compared to 2021, provision for income taxes decreased $205 million primarily due to the sale of HOS. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Tax Matters
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). The IRA contains a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”) provision, effective January 1, 2023. To determine if a company is considered an applicable corporation subject to CAMT, the company’s average adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) for the three consecutive years preceding the tax year must exceed $1 billion. An applicable corporation must make several adjustments to AFSI when determining CAMT under the new law. Initial guidance regarding the application of the CAMT was issued on December 27, 2022, and additional guidance is forthcoming. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the initial guidance and will continue to monitor as additional guidance is released.
On July 8, 2022, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law Act 53 of 2022, which reduces the Pennsylvania State Income Tax Rate in yearly increments starting January 1, 2023, with an initial rate of 8.99% and ending effective January 1, 2031, with a rate of 4.99%. Under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. As such, the Company’s accumulated deferred income tax (“ADIT”) balances for its Pennsylvania subsidiary were remeasured during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to estimate the impacts of the recently enacted tax rate. The remeasurement reduced the ADIT liability by $159 million as of December 31, 2022 and created a corresponding regulatory liability since the EADIT is expected to be returned to customers in a future rate case. However, since the rate is declining in yearly increments, the total EADIT will be subject to change.
On September 27, 2022, Iowa’s Department of Revenue announced a reduction in the state’s top corporate rate from 9.8% to 8.4% effective January 1, 2023. As such, the Company’s ADIT balances for its Iowa subsidiary were remeasured during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, to estimate the impacts of the recently enacted tax rate. The remeasurement reduced the ADIT liability by $2 million as of December 31, 2022 and created a corresponding regulatory liability since the EADIT is expected to be returned to customers in a future rate case.
Federal Net Operating Loss
The Company had no federal NOL carryover balance as of December 31, 2021.
Legislative Updates
During 2022, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 15, 2023:
•Indiana passed Senate Enrolled Act 272, which requires public reporting of a non-jurisdictional utility’s asset management programs. Non-jurisdictional utilities are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the “IURC”). The legislation also creates a water and wastewater research and extension program at a state university to serve as a repository for data collected from utilities. Additionally, the legislation establishes oversight and a receivership program in the IURC for non-jurisdictional utilities with violations that create environmental or human health and safety issues. Legislation was signed by the Governor on March 7, 2022, and became effective on July 1, 2022.
•Indiana passed water and wastewater utility asset financing legislation, Senate Enrolled Act 273, which authorizes the recovery of property tax in Distribution System Improvement Charge filings. The legislation also permits the IURC to allow recovery through tracking mechanisms for changes in property tax and for costs attributable to referenda or action by elected or appointed individuals. Legislation was signed by the Governor on March 10, 2022, and became effective on July 1, 2022.

Table of Contents
•Virginia passed Senate Bill 500 and House Bill 182, which requires the Virginia State Corporation Commission, in any future ratemaking proceeding for an investor-owned water/wastewater utility, to evaluate the utility on a stand-alone basis and utilize the utility’s actual end-of-test period capital structure and cost of capital without regard to the cost of capital, capital structure, or investments of any other entities with which the utility may be affiliated. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 11, 2022, and became effective on July 1, 2022.
•Illinois passed House Bill 900/Public Act 102-0698, which contains appropriations to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity of $3 million for the purposes of the Water and Sewer Finance Assistance Act (H.B. 414/Public Act 102-0262) and $55 million for the purposes of the federal Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP). Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 19, 2022, with these provisions of the bill taking effect on July 1, 2022.
•Tennessee passed Senate Bill 2282 and House Bill 2346, which requires all utilities to implement a cyber security plan and update it every two years to provide for the protection of the utility’s facilities from unauthorized use, alteration, ransom, or destruction of electronic data. The relevant regulatory body will verify if a utility has complied or impose reasonable sanctions if out of compliance. Utility compliance will be required by July 1, 2023. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 1, 2022, and became effective immediately.
•The Missouri General Assembly passed state and local property tax tracker legislation, Senate Bill 745, which requires a utility to defer to a regulatory asset or liability account any difference in what was actually paid in state or local property taxes and what was used to set the revenue requirement in the utility’s most recently completed general rate case. Legislation was signed by the Governor on June 29, 2022, and became effective on August 28, 2022.
•California passed Senate Bill 1469, which allows the CPUC to consider and authorize the implementation of a mechanism that separates the water corporation’s revenue and its water sales. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 30, 2022 and became effective on January 1, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of a seller promissory note, plus interest, and a contingent cash payment payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.
The Company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. The Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings, and may also access the equity capital markets as needed or desired to support capital funding requirements. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms may depend on, as appropriate, any or all of the following: current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general; conditions in the debt or equity capital markets; the Company’s credit ratings; and conditions in the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.

62

Table of Contents
If these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility. AWCC’s revolving credit facility is used principally to support its commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sublimit for the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. On October 26, 2022, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to the revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion and to extend the expiration date of the facility from March 2025 to October 2027. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. Also, effective October 26, 2022, the maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized under AWCC’s commercial paper program was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion. As of December 31, 2022, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.50 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.
The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. The Company’s future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes, and overall economic conditions.
Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. The Company can provide no assurance that its customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future. The Company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. The Company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.

63

Table of Contents
In 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $333 million. The changes were driven by $338 million of estimated tax payments primarily for taxable gains on the sales of the Company’s HOS business and its New York regulated operations, as well as the contribution of $45 million to the American Water Charitable Foundation. Partially offsetting these changes was a decrease due to the gain recognized from the sale of HOS in 2021.
The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Removal costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net (123) (109) (106)
Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,127) $ (1,536) $ (2,061)

In 2022, cash flows used in investing activities increased $591 million primarily due to increased payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds of $608 million received from the sale of the Company’s New York operations. The Company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the Company’s Regulated Businesses, as discussed below.
The Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces mains, services, meters, hydrants and valves, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
Presented in the table below is a summary of the Company’s capital expenditures by category:

--------------------------------- -------------------------------- ----- ---- --- ---- ----- --- - -----

Wastewater 185 137 126
Total capital expenditures $ 2,297 $ 1,764 $ 1,822

In 2022, the Company’s capital expenditures increased $533 million due to an increase across most infrastructure categories.
The Company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the Company’s existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2022, the Company paid $315 million for the acquisition of 26 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 70,000 customers.
As previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion, with $12.5 billion to $13 billion for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and the Company expects to invest between $30 billion to $34 billion over the next 10 years. In 2023, the Company expects to invest $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.5 billion for infrastructure improvements and $400 million for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from financing activities:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - -----
 For the Years Ended December 31,
 2022 2021 2020
(In millions)
Proceeds from long-term debt $ 822 $ 1,118 $ 1,334
Repayments of long-term debt (15) (372) (342)
(Repayments of) proceeds from term loan — (500) 500
Net short-term borrowings (repayments) with maturities less than three months 591 (198) (5)

Other financing activities, net (a) 69 35 22
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,000 $ (345) $ 1,120

(a)Includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan, net of taxes paid, advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption.
In 2022, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $1,345 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings, the repayment in full at maturity of the $500 million term loan in 2021 and repayments of long-term debt due to the prepayment of $327 million in aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding senior notes in 2021, with no comparable repayments in 2022. These changes were partially offset by lower proceeds from long-term debt.
The Company’s financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2022, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $7.6 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting to $3.6 billion.
On May 5, 2022, AWCC issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.45% senior notes due 2032. At closing, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $792 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of the offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations; and (iii) for general corporate purposes.
One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts (through AWCC) for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.
In April 2022, the Company entered into several 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $400 million, and an average fixed interest rate of 2.89%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. In May 2022, the Company terminated the treasury lock agreements, realizing a net gain of approximately $4 million, to be amortized through interest, net over a 10-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the debt issuance on May 5, 2022.

In November and December 2022, the Company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 3.56%. In January 2023, the Company entered into three additional 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. These treasury lock agreements terminate in January 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 3.35%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt.
 No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
In February 2021, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in February 2024. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, $800 million, $1.10 billion, and $1.00 billion, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this and predecessor registration statements.
Presented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2022:

Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes
The outstanding senior notes issued by AWCC have been issued under two indentures, each by and between AWCC and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder. The senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under the senior notes. No other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds to make such payment in full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due, the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.
As a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCC’s ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon AWCC’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes.
Because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent company’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries. See Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity—Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent company’s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent company’s obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than AWCC.

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt
Interest rates on advances under the Company’s revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and S&P Global Ratings’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCC’s commercial paper are considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations thereunder.
Presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31:

The weighted average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41% and 0.20%, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Capital Structure
Presented in the table below is the percentage of the Company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of December 31:

----------------------------------------------------------------- ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- -
 2022 2021 2020
Total common shareholders’ equity 38.3 % 39.9 % 37.1 %
Long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 54.4 % 56.6 % 53.6 %
Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 7.3 % 3.5 % 9.3 %
Total 100 % 100 % 100 %

The changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the HOS sale on December 9, 2021, and the repayment of short-term borrowings with proceeds from the sale, and the Company’s long-term debt offering that was completed on May 5, 2022.
Debt Covenants
The Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.
Covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2022, the Company’s ratio was 0.62 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants.

Security Ratings
Presented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of February 15, 2023, as issued by Moody’s Investors Service on December 19, 2022, and S&P Global Ratings on February 6, 2023:

--------------------- ------------------------- ------------------
Securities Moody’s Investors Service S&P Global Ratings
Rating outlook Stable Stable
Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A
Commercial paper P-2 A-1

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.
As part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.
Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions
For discussion of the Company’s dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 9—Shareholders’ Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Insurance Coverage
The Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’s Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents
Regulation and Regulatory Accounting
The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2022, the Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.
Application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.
For each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and its regulatory liability balance was $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. See Note 3—Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.
In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
Under GAAP, specifically ASC 740, Income Taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.

Table of Contents
Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 14—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.
Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations. The Company also maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.
The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions are:
•Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
•Expected Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Company records currently.
•Rate of Compensation Increase—Management projects employees’ pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.
•Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.
•Mortality— Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.
The discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.58%, 2.94% and 2.74% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.60%, 2.90% and 2.56% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.50% for 2022, 6.50% for 2021, and 6.50% for 2020. The weighted-average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.60% for 2022, 3.67% for 2021 and 3.68% for 2020.

Total 100 % 100 % 100 %

(a)Refer to Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the allocations of assets and the trusts which fund the other postretirement benefit plans
The investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds, commingled funds and limited partnerships. The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.
In selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Company’s rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2022, 3.51% for 2021 and 3.51% for 2020.
In selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2022, the Company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic benefit cost was 6.00% in 2022 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, the Company projects that medical inflation will be 7.00% in 2023 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter.
The Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.58% and 6.75%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will use a weighted-average discount rate and EROA of 5.60% and 5.00%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2022 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $47 million and the 2021 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $41 million. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023; however, the actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.
Benefit Plan Amendments
 In December 2022, the Company amended the American Water Pension Plan (“AWPP”), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as of December 31, 2022. The restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing AWPP into a separate tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, the American Water Pension Plan for Certain Inactive Participants (“AWPP Inactive”). Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. Actuarial gains and losses associated with AWPP Inactive will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants, which increases the amortization period from approximately 7 years to 18 years. The longer amortization period is expected to lower the Company’s pre-tax pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2023. The actuarial gains and losses associated with the AWPP will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service period for active participants. The Company remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets for each plan as of December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents
Upon evaluating prior plan changes, Company funding and market performance, in December 2022, the Company completed plan amendments to spin-off and merge a portion of the American Water Retiree Welfare Plan, with and into the Company’s medical plan for active employees (“Active Medical Plan”), in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the Bargained Retiree Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“Bargained VEBA”) trust. Benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. As a result of these changes, effective December 31, 2022, the Company transferred investment assets from the Bargained VEBA into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of Active Medical Plan participants (“Active VEBA”). The transfer of these Bargained VEBA investment assets into the Active VEBA permits access to approximately $194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. The Company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as permitted by accounting guidance. See Note 18—Fair Value of Financial Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on accounting for the assets as investments in debt and equity securities as of December 31, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the Company’s Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.
Increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $178 million and $162 million, respectively.
The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.
Revenue from the Company’s former HOS business, which was sold in December 2021, was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.
The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue within Other as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $97 million and $86 million, respectively.

Table of Contents
Accounting for Contingencies
The Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.
Actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

NOTE 18. LEASES We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operating lease expense includes variable lease costs and is net of sublease income, both of which are not material. Supplemental cash flow information for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to operating leases was as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ---- - ---- - -- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 107 $ 116 $ 99 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 59 $ 60 $ 52 The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating lease liabilities as of December 2, 2022 were 7 years and 2.37%, respectively.

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The components of lease costs are as follows (in millions): ----------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 380 $ 344 $ 259 Interest 16 15 14 Operating lease cost 1,857 1,540 1,391 Variable lease cost and other, net 363 272 269 Total lease cost $ 2,616 $ 2,171 $ 1,933 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded $1.71 billion impairment loss for operating lease ROU assets as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers, communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers, and consumers. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...
