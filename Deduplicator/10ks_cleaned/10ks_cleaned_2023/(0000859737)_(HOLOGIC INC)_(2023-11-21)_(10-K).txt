Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report.

OVERVIEW
We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products focused on women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment. We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health.
Through our Diagnostics segment, we offer a wide range of diagnostic products, which are used primarily to aid in the screening and diagnosis of human diseases. Our primary Diagnostics products include our molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther, Panther Fusion and Tigris), our ThinPrep cytology system, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, or CT/NG; certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV; Trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis; Mycoplasma genitalium; and Herpes Simplex viruses 1 and 2. We also offer viral load tests for the quantitation of Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and human cytomegalo virus, or CMV, for use on our Panther instrument system. In addition, we offer bacterial vaginosis and candida vaginitis assays for the diagnosis of vaginitis, a common and complex ailment affecting millions of women a year. Our assay portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, various strains of influenza and parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, or GBS, that are run on the Panther Fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to the base Panther system. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and launched the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay (each of which runs on our standard Panther system) and the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (which runs on our Panther Fusion system). In May 2022, we CE-marked two new molecular assays, Panther Fusion EBV Quant assay for quantitation of Epstein-Barr virus, and the Panther Fusion BKV Quant assay for quantitation of the BK virus. These two new assays are the first quantitative real-time PCR assays on the Panther Fusion system. These assays, along with the Aptima CMV Quant assay, expand our Panther Fusion menu of transplant monitoring assays. The ThinPrep System is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. We also generate service revenues from our CLIA-certified laboratory for testing related to breast cancer and all metastatic cancers.
Our Breast Health segment offers a broad portfolio of solutions for breast cancer care primarily in the areas of radiology, breast surgery, pathology and treatment. These solutions include 3D digital mammography systems, image analytics software utilizing artificial intelligence, reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems, breast biopsy site markers, localization, specimen radiology, connectivity solutions and breast conserving surgery products. Our most advanced breast imaging platforms, Selenia 3D Dimensions and 3Dimensions, utilize tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the Genius 3D Mammography exam.
Our GYN Surgical products include our MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System, or MyoSure, NovaSure Endometrial Ablation System, or NovaSure, our Fluent Fluid Management system, or Fluent, our Acessa ProVu laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system, or Acessa ProVu system, as well as our CoolSeal vessel sealing portfolio and our JustRight surgical stapler. The MyoSure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. The NovaSure portfolio is comprised of the NovaSure CLASSIC and NovaSure ADVANCED devices and most recently, the NovaSure portfolio V5 device for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The Fluent system is a fluid management system that provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures. The Acessa ProVu system is a fully integrated system that uses laparoscopic ultrasound, guidance mapping and radio frequency ablation to treat nearly all types of fibroids. The CoolSeal portfolio includes the Trinity, Reveal, and Mini advanced bipolar vessel sealing devices. The JustRight surgical stapler features a smaller instrument profile and is used for laparoscopic general and pediatric surgery.
Our Skeletal Health segment's products includes our Horizon DXA, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and our Fluoroscan Insight FD mini C-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

Supply Chain Considerations

The current worldwide supply chain shortages and constraints continue to impact, although to a lesser extent compared to fiscal 2022, our ability to obtain certain critical raw materials and components used primarily in our Breast Health capital equipment products. We are also dependent on a small number of semiconductor manufacturers and their allocation of chips to us. Based on our recent experience and current understanding of their allocation of chips to us, we have been able to and expect that we will continue to be able to increase production to normalized levels. If such allocation does not meet our expectations or we are not able to obtain alternative sources of chips, we believe we will not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our capital equipment products, primarily Selenia Dimensions and 3Dimension systems, Trident specimen radiography systems and Affirm Prone biopsy systems to meet customer demand and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, the prices of certain raw materials and components have been rising due to certain supply chain shortages and inflation and could increase our costs further.

Acquisitions and Dispositions
The following sets forth a description of certain of our acquisitions and dispositions we have completed in our last two fiscal years:
SuperSonic Imagine Ultrasound Imaging
On September 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SSI ultrasound imaging business to SSH Holdings Limited for a sales price of $1.9 million in cash. The sale was completed on October 3, 2023. We have also agreed to provide certain transition services for up to one year, depending on the nature of the service. The SSI ultrasound imaging asset group met the criteria to be classified as assets held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result, we recorded a charge of $51.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to record the asset group at its fair value less costs to sell pursuant to ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment—Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

JW Medical
On July 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of assets from JW Medical Corporation (“JW Medical”) for a purchase price of $6.7 million. JW Medical was a long-standing distributor of our Breast Health products in South Korea.
Normedi

On April 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Normedi Nordic AS (“Normedi”) for a purchase price of $7.7 million, which includes $1.1 million for contingent consideration. Normedi was a long-standing distributor of our Surgical products in the Nordics region of Europe.
Bolder Surgical
On November 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Bolder Surgical Holdings, Inc. (“Bolder”) for a purchase price of $160.1 million. Bolder, located in Louisville, Colorado, is a developer and manufacturer of energy vessel sealing surgical devices used in both laparoscopic and open procedures. Based on our valuation, we allocated $96.7 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $68.8 million to goodwill. Bolder's results of operations are reported in our GYN Surgical segment.

Product Revenues
Diagnostics $ 1,764.4 43.8 % $ 2,924.6 60.1 % $ (1,160.2) (39.7) %
Breast Health 836.6 20.8 % 680.5 14.0 % 156.1 22.9 %

GYN Surgical 600.0 14.9 % 521.4 10.7 % 78.6 15.1 %
Skeletal Health 78.9 2.0 % 64.7 1.3 % 14.2 21.9 %

 $ 3,279.9 81.4 % $ 4,191.2 86.2 % $ (911.3) (21.7) %

We had a decrease in product revenue of 21.7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in revenues in the Diagnostics business as a result of lower COVID-19 assay sales. This decrease in product revenue was partially offset by an increase in Breast Health and Skeletal Health revenue as supply chain constraints continued to ease, an increase in GYN Surgical revenues, as well as an extra week of activity in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year.
Diagnostics product revenues decreased 39.7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in Molecular Diagnostics of $1,173.2 million, partially offset by an increase in Cytology and Perinatal revenue of $6.8 million, and an increase in Blood Screening of $6.2 million. Molecular Diagnostics product revenue was $1,254.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $2,427.5 million in fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction of $1,182.3 million in sales of our two SARS-CoV-2 assays (primarily the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay and to a lesser extent the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay) to $248.2 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $1,430.5 million in fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower demand from an improvement in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year, the increasing use of rapid tests and a decrease in average selling prices internationally. We also had a decrease in sales of collection devices as a result of lower assay sales, lower Panther instruments sales as demand for those instruments has decreased, which we primarily attribute to our significantly expanded install base and the decline in the COVID-19 pandemic in the current year, and lower Mobidiag product sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $86.3 million in our Aptima assays (exclusive of our SARS-CoV-2 assay), primarily driven by an increase in our CV Candida, Bacterial Vaginosis, and CT/NG assay volumes, which we attribute to an increase in wellness visits and expanded adoption by our laboratory customers. In addition, we had an increase in worldwide sales of our Fusion respiratory products, which we attribute to a strong flu season, and Quant Viral assays, including our HIV assay sold in Africa, in the current fiscal year. Within Cytology & Perinatal, we had an increase in sales of our ThinPrep Pap Test products driven by increased demand which we primarily attribute to the increase in wellness visits following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower Perinatal volumes in Europe. We also experienced a decline in revenue from international sales denominated in foreign currencies from the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar against a number of currencies.
Breast Health product revenues increased 22.9% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a significant increase in volumes of our digital mammography systems, primarily Selenia 3D Dimensions and 3Dimensions systems and related workstation and workflow products including software, and to a lesser extent an increase in Trident systems unit sales and higher Faxitron breast conserving surgery products. The increase in volume was primarily driven by the improvement in supply chain constraints related to electronic components, primarily semiconductor chips, which impacted our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet customer demand in the prior year. These increases were slightly offset by a reduction in the volume of our ultrasound imaging products. In addition, we had an increase in sales of our interventional breast solutions products of $8.7 million in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by higher Brevera systems sales and related disposables, partially offset by lower volumes of Eviva handpieces. We also experienced a decline in revenue from international sales denominated in foreign currencies from the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar against a number of currencies.

GYN Surgical product revenues increased 15.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in the sales volume of our MyoSure devices, Fluent Fluid Management disposables and NovaSure devices as procedure rates continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to a lesser extent an increase in sales volume of our CoolSeal vessel sealers from the Bolder acquisition as we expand physician adoption. Partially offsetting this increase was the negative effect on revenue from international sales denominated in foreign currencies from the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar against a number of currencies.
Skeletal Health product revenues increased 21.9% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our Horizon DXA systems and to a lesser extent our InSight FD Fluoroscan systems and system upgrades. The sales volume increase was largely attributable to the easing of supply chain constraints.
Product revenues by geography as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:

------------- ----------------- - ----------------- ----- -
 Years ended
 September 30,2023 September 24,2022
United States 74.0 % 69.4 %
Europe 13.9 % 19.7 %
Asia-Pacific 6.6 % 7.7 %
Rest of World 5.5 % 3.2 %
 100.0 % 100.0 %

The percentage of product revenue derived from the U.S. increased while Europe and Asia-Pacific decreased, which we primarily attribute to the significant increase in the U.S. of Breast Health capital equipment sales and related workflow products including software, and increases in Aptima assay sales (exclusive of our Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assays), Surgical devices and disposables including MyoSure, Fluent, and CoolSeal, as well as a lesser decline in SARS-CoV-2 assay volume in the U.S. compared to Europe and Asia-Pacific. Product revenue decreased in China in the current year which we primarily attribute to surges of COVID-19 and related shutdowns in the first six months of the current year, which primarily impacted the sale of our Diagnostics products (excluding SARS-CoV-2 assays) and digital mammography systems. The percentage of product revenue increased in Rest of World in the current year primarily due to an increase in Breast Health capital equipment sales and to a lesser extent Surgical sales for Canada, the Middle East, and Latin America, partially offset by a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 assay volumes in the Rest of World.

 Amount % of TotalRevenue Amount % of TotalRevenue Amount %
Service and Other Revenues $ 750.5 18.6 % $ 671.6 13.8 % $ 78.9 11.7 %

Service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. The majority of these revenues are generated within our Breast Health segment. Service and other revenues increased 11.7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the continued conversion of a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period, and to a lesser extent an increase in spare parts and installation and training revenue related to an increase in sales of our mammography systems. In the current year, revenues were also higher from the extra week of service contract activity, resulting in $7.9 million of incremental revenue. In our Diagnostics business, service revenue increased as a result of higher lab testing volumes from our Biotheranostics CLIA laboratory, which we primarily attribute to market acceptance from increased marketing efforts and improved customer experience.

** Percentage not meaningful
Product gross margin was 52.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to 64.7% in fiscal 2022.
Cost of Product Revenues. The cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 36.1% in the current year compared to 27.8% in the prior year. Cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2023 primarily due to a decrease in sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, which have higher gross margins compared to our other Diagnostic products and comprised 7.6% and 34.1% of total product revenue in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Higher product costs from supply chain constraints and inflation also contributed to the increase in the cost of product revenue. This increase was partially offset by higher sales of our digital mammography systems and related software products.
Diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, a slight decline in average selling prices of certain assays, a $24.7 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter to write-off inventory related to a certain product line discontinuance, unfavorable manufacturing variances at certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher field service costs for our expanded instrument installed base. Partially offsetting this increase was lower sales of instruments, which carry low margins, an increase in sales of our Aptima, Fusion, and Quant Viral assays, and lower freight costs internationally.
Breast Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher sales volumes of our higher margin products, primarily 3D Dimensions, and improved manufacturing utilization partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices of our biopsy disposables due to competitive pressures, and higher prices of raw materials and components from supply chain constraints and inflation. Also partially offsetting the decrease in product costs as a percentage of revenue was an increase in inventory reserves and freight.
GYN Surgical’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to product mix of higher volumes of lower margin products, mostly attributable to sales of our Fluent Fluid Management systems, CoolSeal vessel sealers and scopes, partially offset by an increase in volume of higher margin products, primarily MyoSure and NovaSure, as procedure rates continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher average selling prices of our NovaSure V5 device.
Skeletal Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher sales volumes of our Horizon DXA systems, upgrades and Insight FD systems as well as an increase in average selling prices of our Horizon DXA systems, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of our Insight FD systems and higher component costs from supply chain constraints and inflation.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of product revenues relates to acquired developed technology, which is generally amortized over its estimated useful life of between 5 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. Amortization expense decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cytyc acquisition which became fully amortized in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and to a lesser extent, lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Mobidiag and SSI acquisitions due to impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Focal and Faxitron acquisitions due to impairments in the prior year.

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Equipment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process as well as evaluating the current operating performance of our Mobidiag business (included in the Diagnostics reportable segment), including product design and manufacturing requirements, we reassessed the short-term and long-term commercial plans for this business. We made certain operational and strategic decisions to invest and focus more on the long-term success of this business, which resulted in the significant reduction of forecasted revenues and operating results. As a result, we determined indicators of impairment existed and performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis pursuant to ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment - Overall, to determine if the cash flows expected to be generated by the Mobidiag business over the estimated remaining useful life of its primary asset were sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group. Based on this analysis the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets. Therefore, we were required to perform Step 3 of the impairment test and determine the fair value of the asset group. To estimate the fair value of the asset group, we utilized the income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset group and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assumptions used in the DCF require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows were based on our most recent strategic plan and for periods beyond the strategic plan, our estimates were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. We believe the assumptions were consistent with the plans and estimates that a market participant would use to manage the business. The discount rate used is intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and was based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of market participants relative to the asset group. We used a discount rate of 17.0%. As a result of this analysis, the fair value of the Mobidiag asset group was below its carrying value. To record the asset group to fair value, we recorded an impairment charge of $186.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The impairment charge was allocated to the long-lived assets on a pro-rata basis and $153.7 million of developed technology assets and $9.1 million of equipment was written off to cost of product revenues. Prior to recording this impairment charge, we determined that the in-process research and development asset (“IPR&D”) recorded in connection with the Mobidiag acquisition was impaired and based on its fair value determined utilizing the DCF, we recorded an impairment charge of $10.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We believe our assumptions used to determine the fair value of the asset group were reasonable. Actual operating results and the related cash flows of the asset group could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows. In the event the asset group does not meet its forecasted projections, additional impairment charges could be recorded in the future.

In addition to the impairment charges discussed above, we also identified indicators of impairment related to our SSI ultrasound imaging business (included in the Breast Health reportable segment). We determined that the fair value of this asset group was approximately zero and the carrying value of the long-lived assets was fully impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $26.4 million. The impairment charge was allocated to the long-lived assets and $16.7 million of developed technology assets were written off to cost of product revenues.

In fiscal 2022, we determined that certain developed technology assets acquired in the Focal and Faxitron acquisitions were impaired as a result of the decision to cease selling certain low volume products. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.4 million to write-off these developed technology assets.

Service and other revenues gross margin was 48.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to 42.5% in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in lab testing revenue from our Biotheranostics business, which has higher margins than our legacy service business, and an increase in the average selling prices and attachment rates of our Breast Health service contracts and time and material billings.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 3.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits primarily from our deferred compensation plan and an extra week of expenses in the current fiscal year and an increase in Breast Health as the prior year period included a $5.2 million credit for the release of a research and development tax credit reserve related to the SSI acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in expenses to implement the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) requirements. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 5.6% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower spending on advertising and marketing initiatives as the prior year included a significantly larger sponsorship amount in fiscal 2022 for the Women's Tennis Association, the airing of our Super Bowl commercial, and grants supporting women’s health initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits primarily driven by higher commissions from the increase in Breast Health and GYN Surgical sales, an increase in headcount, higher expense from our deferred compensation plan and an extra week of expenses in the current fiscal year, and to a lesser extent higher travel and meeting expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in charitable donations of $23.0 million, a $7.4 million settlement awarded to Hologic in the Minerva litigation received in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and lower tax consulting and legal expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits from higher expense from our deferred compensation plan due to stock market gains and an increase in stock compensation, an $8.9 million charge to settle a business dispute in connection with terminating the Mobidiag joint venture agreement in China, an increase in information systems infrastructure and facilities costs, an increase in reserves for sales and use tax matters, higher travel, and higher compensation and benefits from the extra week in the current fiscal year.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization expense decreased 37.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to assets from our Cytyc acquisition becoming fully amortized at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Equipment. As discussed above, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $197.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 related to our Mobidiag acquisition and $26.4 million related to our SSI ultrasound imaging assets. The impairment charges were allocated to the long-lived assets and written off to operating expenses as follows: Mobidiag - $10.5 million to IPR&D, $10.4 million to customer relationships, $10.7 million to trade names, and $3.0

million to equipment; Ultrasound Imaging - $2.4 million to customer relationships, $1.7 million to trade names, and $5.6 million to equipment.
Contingent Consideration Fair Value Adjustments. In connection with the acquisition of Acessa Health, Inc., or Acessa, we are obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. The payments are based on achieving incremental revenue growth over a three-year period ending annually in each of December 2021, 2022, and 2023. As of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent consideration liability for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business. This liability is not contingent on future employment, and we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation based on future revenue projections of Acessa, comparable company revenue growth rates, implied volatility and applying a risk adjusted discount rate. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from the passage of time, changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. In the current year, we recorded a gain of $14.9 million based on a decrease in forecasted revenues over the remaining earn-out period. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a gain of $39.5 million primarily due to a reduction in forecasted revenues over the measurement period and to a lesser extent an increase in the discount rate from higher market interest rates.
Loss on Assets Held-For-Sale. As discussed above, we recorded a charge of $51.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 related to our SSI ultrasound imaging assets to record the asset group to fair value less the costs to sell.
Restructuring Charges. We have implemented various cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with our operations and related to integration activities. These actions have primarily resulted in the termination of employees. As a result, we recorded charges of $12.0 million in fiscal 2023 and $2.4 million in fiscal 2022, primarily related to severance benefits. For additional information, please refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Interest Income $ 120.5 $ 12.9 $ 107.6 834.1 %

Interest income in fiscal 2023 increased significantly compared to fiscal 2022 due to the significant increase in market interest rates over the past eighteen months as the U.S. Federal Reserve began periodically raising its Federal Funds Rate starting in March 2022. To a lesser extent, the increase in interest income was due to higher average cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year.

Interest Expense $ (111.1) $ (95.1) $ (16.0) 16.8 %

Interest expense in fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily consisted of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in the variable interest rate under our 2021 Credit Agreement based on SOFR, partially offset by $35.4 million received under an interest rate swap agreement, which hedges the benchmark interest rate, versus payments of $4.9 million under the interest rate swap in the prior year period. In addition, the prior year interest expense included debt refinancing costs for our 2021 Credit Agreement, and interest expense related to debt acquired in the Mobidiag acquisition which was paid off in the prior year.

Provision for Income Taxes $ 220.1 $ 286.2 $ (66.1) (23.1) %

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was a provision of 32.6%. The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax effect of the SSI ultrasound imaging assets-held-for-sale charge, income tax reserves, the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, and state income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, and the geographic mix of income earned by our international subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was a provision of 18.0%. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, reserve releases resulting from statute of limitations expirations and favorable audit settlements (net of reserve additions for uncertain tax positions), the geographic mix of income earned by the Company's international subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate and a tax benefit related to an internal restructuring, partially offset by state income taxes and the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion.
Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical, and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income (loss). Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

Total Revenues $ 1,880.1 $ 3,018.5 $ (1,138.4) (37.7) %
Operating Income $ 193.9 $ 1,359.4 $ (1,165.5) (85.7) %
Operating Income as a % of Segment Revenue 10.3 % 45.0 %

Diagnostics revenues decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above, partially offset by higher lab testing revenue from our Biotheranostics business.
Operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from lower SARS-CoV-2 assay sales and the Mobidiag impairment charges of $197.4 million recorded in the third quarter discussed above. Gross margin was 44.7% in the current year compared to 67.1% in the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays which have a higher margin, a slight decline in average selling prices of certain assays, the impairment charges discussed above of which $162.8 million was included in costs of revenues, a $24.7 million charge to write-off inventory related to a product line discontinuance, unfavorable manufacturing variances at certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher field service costs from our expanded instrument installed base, partially offset by increases in core Aptima assay and ThinPrep Pap Test volumes, higher lab testing revenue and a $41.4 million decrease in intangible asset amortization expense as assets acquired in the Cytyc acquisition became fully amortized in the current year. Also partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in Fusion respiratory and Quant Viral assay volumes in the current fiscal year and lower freight costs internationally.

Table of Contents

Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in marketing expenses and allocated advertising and charitable donations, a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense, and a decrease in commissions and bonus as well as lower consulting costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was the impairment charge discussed above of which $34.6 million was included in operating expenses, a settlement charge of $8.9 million related to the termination of the Mobidiag joint venture in China, an increase in compensation and benefits from the extra week in the current fiscal year, an increase in facilities cost and an increase in travel expenses.

Operating Income as a % of Segment Revenue 19.1 % 14.9 %

Breast Health revenues increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in product and service revenue discussed above.

Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from both product sales and services, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 54.8% in the current year compared to 51.9% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to higher volumes of our capital equipment and related software sales, and interventional breast solutions devices, an increase in service margin from the continued conversion of digital mammography systems to service contracts and to a lesser extent the extra week in the current fiscal year and an increase in the average selling prices and attachment rates of our service contracts. These increases were partially offset by the impairment charges related to our SSI ultrasound imaging business discussed above, of which $16.7 million was included in cost of revenues, and higher costs for raw materials and components from supply chain constraints and inflation, and a slight decline in average selling prices of our biopsy disposables. We also had an increase in inventory reserves and freight in the current year.
Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the loss on assets-held-for-sale of $51.7 million and impairment charges related to our SSI ultrasound imaging business discussed above, of which $9.7 million was included in operating expenses, an increase in commissions from higher sales, an increase in travel and meeting expense and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by a decrease due to the release of the research and development credit reserve related to the SSI acquisition and a decrease in marketing initiatives, allocated advertising and charitable contributions. In addition, there was an increase in compensation and benefits from the extra week in the current year.

GYN Surgical revenues increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase in product revenues discussed above.
Operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in gross profit offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 67.7% in the current year, compared to 59.2% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense of $41.2 million in the current year as assets acquired in the Cytyc acquisition became fully amortized, an increase in volume of higher margin products, primarily MyoSure and NovaSure, as procedure rates continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher average selling prices of our NovaSure V5 device. These increases were partially offset by higher volumes of lower margin products, mostly attributable to sales of our Fluent Fluid Management systems, CoolSeal vessel sealers and scopes.

Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a gain of $39.5 million recorded in the prior fiscal year compared to a gain of $14.9 million recorded in the current year to decrease the Acessa contingent consideration liability to fair value. In addition, we had an increase in compensation and benefits primarily due to an increase in commissions and higher salaries from an increase in headcount as well as an increase in travel expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was a gain of $7.4 million for infringement damages from the Minerva litigation, which was recorded as a credit to general and administrative expenses, a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense, lower R&D project spend, and lower marketing initiative spend and allocated advertising and charitable donations.

Skeletal Health revenues increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the increase in product revenues as discussed above and to a lesser extent the increase in service contract revenue from the extra week in the current fiscal year.
Operating income increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in gross profit and a decrease in operating expenses. Gross margin was 32.2% in the current year compared to 28.2% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher sales volumes of our Horizon DXA, Insight FD systems, and system upgrades and an increase in the average selling prices of our Horizon DXA systems, partially offset by increased costs from supply chain constraints and inflation.
Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in marketing initiatives and research and development project spend.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At September 30, 2023, we had working capital of $2,977.2 million, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,722.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $416.2 million during fiscal 2023 principally due to cash generated from operating activities partially offset by cash used in investing and financing activities primarily related to repurchases of our common stock and capital expenditures.
In fiscal 2023, our operating activities provided cash of $1,051.2 million, primarily due to net income of $456.0 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $323.4 million, intangible asset equipment impairment charges of $223.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $79.6 million, and a loss on assets held-for-sale related to the SSI ultrasound imaging business of $51.7 million. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred taxes of $109.1 million primarily due to the capitalization of research expenditures under the tax rules and to a lesser extent the amortization and impairments of intangible assets. Cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of $11.8 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The net cash inflow was primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $23.6 million primarily due to normal amortization related to the Women’s Tennis Association sponsorship and service and software subscriptions, a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $17.4 million primarily due to the timing of tax payments relative to the provision for income taxes, and an increase in deferred revenue of $14.4 million primarily due to billings for annual service contracts under our expanded installed base of digital mammography systems. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $23.0 million primarily due to timing of payments and a decrease in accrued expenses of $14.2 million primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits for annual bonuses and timing of payroll versus the prior year, and a decrease in professional services partially offset by an increase of value-added tax payments primarily due to timing.
In fiscal 2023, our investing activities used cash of $152.1 million primarily due to capital expenditures of $150.2 million, which primarily consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchase of

manufacturing equipment and building improvements primarily related to the build out of our Newark facility for the transfer of our Breast Health capital equipment manufacturing operations, and to a lesser extent the build out of our new innovation center and Biotheranostics CLIA laboratory at our San Diego facility, and $10.0 million for the purchase of an equity investment. These uses of cash were partially offset by a final reimbursement of $20.5 million received from the Department of Defense under a grant to increase production capacity of our two SARS-CoV-2 assays.
In fiscal 2023, our financing activities used cash of $483.2 million, primarily due to $474.8 million for repurchases of our common stock, $24.0 million for the payment of employee taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units, $15.0 million for debt principal payments under our 2021 Credit Agreement and a $7.6 million contingent consideration payment related to the Acessa Health acquisition. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was $43.0 million from our equity plans from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan.
Debt
We had total recorded debt outstanding of $2.82 billion at September 30, 2023, which was comprised of amounts outstanding under our 2021 Credit Agreement of $1.48 billion (principal of $1.49 billion), 2029 Senior Notes of $938.8 million (principal of $950.0 million), and 2028 Senior Notes of $396.8 million (principal of $400.0 million).
2021 Credit Agreement
On September 27, 2021, we refinanced our existing term loan and revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto (the “2018 Credit Agreement”) by entering into Refinancing Amendment (the “2021 Credit Agreement”). Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first priority security interest in, substantially all of our and our Subsidiary Guarantors’ U.S. assets. The credit facilities (the “2021 Credit Facilities”) under the 2021 Credit Agreement consist of:
•A $1.5 billion secured term loan (“2021 Term Loan”) with a stated maturity date of September 25, 2026; and
•A secured revolving credit facility (the “2021 Revolver”) under which the Borrowers may borrow up to $2.0 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a stated maturity date of September 25, 2026.
As of September 30, 2023, there were no borrowings under the 2021 Revolver.
On August 22, 2022, we further amended the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) related to the planned phase out of LIBOR by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. Under this amendment, the interest rate applicable to the loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement denominated in U.S. dollars were converted to a variant of the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus an applicable spread.
Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement, other than Swing Line Loans, bear interest, at our option, at the Base Rate, at the Term SOFR Rate, at the Alternative Currency Daily Rate, or at the Daily SOFR Rate, in each case plus the Applicable Rate.
The Applicable Rate in regard to the Base Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the Alternative Currency Daily Rate, the Alternative Currency Term Rate and the Daily SOFR Rate is subject to change depending on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate under the 2021 Term Loan was 6.42% per annum.
We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee calculated on a daily basis equal to the Applicable Rate as of such day multiplied by the undrawn committed amount available under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2023, this commitment fee was 0.15% per annum for the 2021 Revolver.
We are required to make scheduled principal payments under the 2021 Term Loan in increasing amounts ranging from $3.75 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on December 29, 2022 to $18.75 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on December 26, 2025. The remaining scheduled balance of $1.335 billion (or such lesser aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding) on the 2021 Term Loan and any amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolver are due at their respective maturities. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement, we may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances (excluding permitted debt) and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights). Certain of the mandatory prepayments are subject to reduction or elimination if certain financial covenants are met. Subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily prepay any of the 2021 Credit Facilities without premium or penalty. As of September 30, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the 2021

Table of Contents

Term Loan was $1.5 billion. On October 27, 2023 (in the first quarter of fiscal 2024), we made a $250.0 million voluntary prepayment on the 2021 Term Loan.
The 2021 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and grant additional liens on our assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of our business. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. The 2021 Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payments defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross defaults and an event of default upon a change of control of the company.
The 2021 Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each quarter for the previous twelve-month period. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.
2028 Senior Notes
The total aggregate principal balance of the 2028 Senior Notes is $400.0 million. The 2028 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. The 2028 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2028 Senior Notes on or after: February 1, 2023 through February 1, 2024 at 102.312% of par; February 1, 2024 through February 1, 2025 at 101.541% of par; February 1, 2025 through February 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and February 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2028 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
2029 Senior Notes
 The total aggregate principal balance of the 2029 Senior Notes is $950.0 million. The 2029 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2029 and bear interest at the rate of 3.250% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2029 Senior Notes on or after: September 28, 2023 through September 27, 2024 at 101.625% of par; September 28, 2024 through September 27, 2025 at 100.813% of par; and September 28, 2025 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2029 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
Contingent Consideration Earn-Out Payments
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earn-out payments tied to performance criteria, principally revenue growth of the acquired business over a specified period. In addition, contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn-out obligations may result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. Our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses.
Contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments. Pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date. This liability is re-measured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through a separate line item within our Consolidated Statements of Income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in discount rates, changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates, and accretion of the liability for the passage of time.

Table of Contents

Our contingent consideration liability is primarily related to our Acessa acquisition. We have an obligation to the former Acessa shareholders to make contingent payments based on a multiple of annual incremental revenue growth over a three-year period ending annually in December. There is no maximum earnout. Pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, the contingent consideration was deemed to be part of the purchase price, and we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation based on future revenue projections of the business, comparable companies’ revenue growth rates, implied volatility and applying a risk adjusted discount rate. The first earn-out period was completed in December 2021, and we paid $12.2 million to the former shareholders in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The second earn-out period was completed in December 2022, resulting in a payment amount of $7.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023, we updated our forecasted revenue and recorded a gain of $14.9 million to record the liability to fair value. The reduction in fair value was primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenues. As of September 30, 2023 this liability was recorded at its fair value of $0.9 million.
Stock Repurchase Program
On September 22, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, with a five-year term, to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, effective as of the close of trading on September 23, 2022. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock for a total consideration of $501.4 million. As of September 30, 2023, $498.6 million remained authorized for repurchase. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for a total consideration of $150.0 million.
On November 6, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. On November 15, 2023, we executed the ASR agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. (“Goldman Sachs”) pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase $500 million of the Company’s common stock. In connection with the launch of the ASR, on November 17, 2023, we paid Goldman Sachs an aggregate of $500 million and received approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock, representing 80% of the transaction value based on our closing share price on November 14, 2023. The final number of shares to be received under the ASR agreement will be determined upon completion of the transaction and will be based on the total transaction value and the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock during the term of the transaction. Final settlement of the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.
The timing of any future share repurchases will be based upon our continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors. Repurchases under the authorized share repurchase program may be made using a variety of methods, which may include, but are not limited to, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase agreements, or purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan under the Exchange Act. The authorized share repurchase program may be suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Future Liquidity Considerations
We expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the “Risk Factors” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers set forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and the cash available under our 2021 Revolver will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, strategic transactions or other investments. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our 2021 Credit Agreement, 2028 Senior Notes, and 2029 Senior Notes. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors set forth elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.
Legal Contingencies
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. In connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are developed, as applicable in consultation with outside counsel, and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such financial outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.
Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Table of Contents

We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
The following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Inventory
Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment, diagnostic test kits, and disposable surgical devices, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.
Business Combinations
We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. Contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value measured on the date of acquisition using an appropriate valuation model, such as the Monte Carlo simulation model. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, in which the model runs many simulations based on comparable companies' growth rates and their implied volatility. These cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. Each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment, specifically projected revenues, and given the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded and could be materially different.
The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill.
We generally use the income approach in which cash flow projections on an after-tax basis are discounted using a risk adjusted rate to determine the estimated fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development projects, customer relationships, and trade names. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results, specifically revenue growth rates. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
With respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. Generally, we apply the cost or income approach as the primary methods

in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.
Goodwill
We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.
In performing the test, we either use the qualitative assessment permitted by ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, or the single step quantitative approach prescribed under ASC 350 including amendments under ASU 2017-04. Under the qualitative approach we consider a number of factors, including the amount by which the previous quantitative test's fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units, the forecasts in our then-current strategic plan compared to the forecasts in the previous quantitative test, an evaluation of discount rates, long-term growth rates including the terminal year rate, if tax rates would have significantly changed, an evaluation of current economic factors for both the worldwide economy and specifically the medical device industry, and any significant changes in customer and supplier relationships. We weigh these factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If after performing a qualitative assessment, indicators are present, or we identify factors that cause us to believe it is appropriate to perform a more precise calculation of fair value, we would move beyond the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
Under the quantitative impairment test, we perform a comparison of the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. We consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we apply the single step approach under ASU 2017-04. As a result of this simplified approach the goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value to the extent of the goodwill balance.
We conducted our fiscal 2023 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter and utilized the quantitative approach. We used discounted cash flows, or DCF, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of July 2, 2023 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the DCF in making our impairment test conclusions. We believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. As a result of completing this analysis, all of our reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values.
At September 30, 2023, we believe that our reporting units, with goodwill aggregating $3.3 billion, were not at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test based on our current forecasts and qualitative assessment.
Since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the DCF, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the WACC, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher WACC because market participants would require a higher rate of return. In the DCF as the WACC increases, the fair value decreases. The other significant factor in the DCF is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and stated net of accumulated amortization and impairments. We amortize intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method, or if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be utilized. We evaluate the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances or business conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows for each asset group. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we estimate the fair value of the assets, generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the assets using a risk-adjusted discount rate. To estimate the fair value of the assets, the Company uses market participant assumptions pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.
Indefinite lived intangible assets, such as IPR&D assets, are initially recorded at fair value and are required to be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. The Company’s annual impairment test date is as of the first day of its fourth quarter. We estimate the fair value of IPR&D assets utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and key assumptions are revenue growth rates, timing of completion of the project, costs to complete the project and discount rates. These estimates require significant judgment and adverse changes in assumptions could result in a lower fair value.
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from the sale of our products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems. See Note 3 for further discussion of revenue recognition.
We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met: we have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified; the transaction price, or the amount that we expect to receive, including an estimate of uncertain amounts subject to a constraint to ensure revenue is not recognized in an amount that would result in a significant reversal upon resolution of the uncertainty, is determinable; and we have transferred control of the promised items to the customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in the contract. The transaction price for the contract is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services expected to be transferred. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the distinct good or service is transferred. Transfer of control for our products is generally at shipment or delivery, depending on contractual terms, but occurs when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which represents the point in time when the customer obtains the use of and substantially all of the remaining benefit of the product. As such, the performance obligation related to product sales is satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from support and maintenance contracts and extended warranties are recognized over time based on the contract term, which represents a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services given the stand-ready nature of the performance obligations. Service revenue related to professional services for installation, training and repairs is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific nature of the service.
We recognize receivables when we have an unconditional right to payment, which represents the amount we expect to collect in a transaction and is most often equal to the transaction price in the contract. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs within costs of product revenue when the corresponding revenue is recognized.
Generally the contracts for capital equipment include multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we are required to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. We determine the best estimate of standalone selling price using average selling prices over 3- to 12-month periods of data depending on the products or nature of the services coupled with current market considerations. If the product or service does not have a history of sales or if sales volume is not sufficient, we rely on prices set by our pricing committees or applicable marketing department adjusted for expected discounts.
We exercise judgement in estimating variable consideration, which includes volume discounts, sales rebates, product returns and other adjustments. These amounts are recorded as a reduction to revenue and classified as a current liability. We base our estimates for volume discounts and sales rebates on historical information to the extent it is reasonable to be used as a predictive tool of expected future rebates. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts. Our contracts for the sale

51

Table of Contents

of capital equipment and related components, and assays and tests typically do not provide the right to return product, however, our contracts for the sale of our interventional breast and surgical handpieces provide for a right of return for a limited period of time. In general, estimates of variable consideration and constraints are not material to our financial statements.
We also place instruments (or equipment) at customer sites but retain title to the instrument (for example, the ThinPrep Processor, ThinPrep Imaging System, and the Panther system). The customer has the right to use the instrument for a period of time, and then we recover the cost of providing the instrument through the sales of disposables, namely tests and assays in Diagnostics and handpieces in GYN Surgical. These types of agreements include an embedded operating lease for the right to use an instrument and no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument delivery. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the embedded lease concurrent with the sale of disposables over the term of the agreement.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and also for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at each reporting period. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws applicable to the period and jurisdiction in which we expect the differences to affect taxable income. We evaluate both the positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance. The future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in each jurisdiction of the right type to realize the assets. We establish a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. To the extent we establish or release a valuation allowance, a tax charge or benefit will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision on the statement of operations in the reporting period that such determination is made.
We have recognized $36.4 million in net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2023 and $74.6 million in net deferred tax liabilities at September 24, 2022. The change was primarily due to recording a deferred tax asset on capitalized research and development costs and intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2023. The tax liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The tax assets primarily relate to net operating and capital loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development costs, accruals and reserves, and stock-based compensation.
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
As of September 30, 2023, we had $256.5 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $240.5 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, we had $247.6 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $231.6 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate.
In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. While we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

OVERVIEW
We are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products focused on women']:
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Operations Founded in 1982, Adobe is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs"), systems integrators ("SIs"), independent software vendors ("ISVs"), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, other devices and the web, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial State...

['s Tennis Association, the airing of our Super Bowl commercial, and grants supporting women’s health initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits primarily driven by higher commissions from the increase in Breast Health and GYN Surgical sales, an increase in headcount, higher expense from our deferred compensation plan and an extra week of expenses in the current fiscal year, and to a lesser extent higher travel and meeting expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in charitable donations of $23.0 million, a $7.4 million settlement awarded to Hologic in the Minerva litigation received in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and lower tax consulting and legal expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits from higher expense from our deferred compensation plan due to stock market gains and an increase in stock compensation, an $8.9 million charge to settle a business dispute in connection with terminating the Mobidiag joint venture agreement in China, an increase in information systems infrastructure and facilities costs, an increase in reserves for sales and use tax matters, higher travel, and higher compensation and benefits from the extra week in the current fiscal year.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization expense decreased 37.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to assets from our Cytyc acquisition becoming fully amortized at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Equipment. As discussed above, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $197.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 related to our Mobidiag acquisition and $26.4 million related to our SSI ultrasound imaging assets. The impairment charges were allocated to the long-lived assets and written off to operating expenses as follows: Mobidiag - $10.5 million to IPR&D, $10.4 million to customer relationships, $10.7 million to trade names, and $3.0

million to equipment; Ultrasound Imaging - $2.4 million to customer relationships, $1.7 million to trade names, and $5.6 million to equipment.
Contingent Consideration Fair Value Adjustments. In connection with the acquisition of Acessa Health, Inc., or Acessa, we are obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. The payments are based on achieving incremental revenue growth over a three-year period ending annually in each of December 2021, 2022, and 2023. As of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent consideration liability for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business. This liability is not contingent on future employment, and we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation based on future revenue projections of Acessa, comparable company revenue growth rates, implied volatility and applying a risk adjusted discount rate. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from the passage of time, changes in discount rates, and changes in the timing, probabilities and amount of revenue estimates. In the current year, we recorded a gain of $14.9 million based on a decrease in forecasted revenues over the remaining earn-out period. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a gain of $39.5 million primarily due to a reduction in forecasted revenues over the measurement period and to a lesser extent an increase in the discount rate from higher market interest rates.
Loss on Assets Held-For-Sale. As discussed above, we recorded a charge of $51.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 related to our SSI ultrasound imaging assets to record the asset group to fair value less the costs to sell.
Restructuring Charges. We have implemented various cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with our operations and related to integration activities. These actions have primarily resulted in the termination of employees. As a result, we recorded charges of $12.0 million in fiscal 2023 and $2.4 million in fiscal 2022, primarily related to severance benefits. For additional information, please refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

 Amount Amount Amount %
Interest Income $ 120.5 $ 12.9 $ 107.6 834.1 %

Interest income in fiscal 2023 increased significantly compared to fiscal 2022 due to the significant increase in market interest rates over the past eighteen months as the U.S. Federal Reserve began periodically raising its Federal Funds Rate starting in March 2022. To a lesser extent, the increase in interest income was due to higher average cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year.

Interest expense in fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily consisted of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in the variable interest rate under our 2021 Credit Agreement based on SOFR, partially offset by $35.4 million received under an interest rate swap agreement, which hedges the benchmark interest rate, versus payments of $4.9 million under the interest rate swap in the prior year period. In addition, the prior year interest expense included debt refinancing costs for our 2021 Credit Agreement, and interest expense related to debt acquired in the Mobidiag acquisition which was paid off in the prior year.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was a provision of 32.6%. The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax effect of the SSI ultrasound imaging assets-held-for-sale charge, income tax reserves, the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, and state income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, and the geographic mix of income earned by our international subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was a provision of 18.0%. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income, reserve releases resulting from statute of limitations expirations and favorable audit settlements (net of reserve additions for uncertain tax positions), the geographic mix of income earned by the Company']:

("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform.

Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical, and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income (loss). Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

Operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from lower SARS-CoV-2 assay sales and the Mobidiag impairment charges of $197.4 million recorded in the third quarter discussed above. Gross margin was 44.7% in the current year compared to 67.1% in the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased sales of our SARS-CoV-2 assays which have a higher margin, a slight decline in average selling prices of certain assays, the impairment charges discussed above of which $162.8 million was included in costs of revenues, a $24.7 million charge to write-off inventory related to a product line discontinuance, unfavorable manufacturing variances at certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher field service costs from our expanded instrument installed base, partially offset by increases in core Aptima assay and ThinPrep Pap Test volumes, higher lab testing revenue and a $41.4 million decrease in intangible asset amortization expense as assets acquired in the Cytyc acquisition became fully amortized in the current year. Also partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in Fusion respiratory and Quant Viral assay volumes in the current fiscal year and lower freight costs internationally.

These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred taxes of $109.1 million primarily due to the capitalization of research expenditures under the tax rules and to a lesser extent the amortization and impairments of intangible assets. Cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of $11.8 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The net cash inflow was primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $23.6 million primarily due to normal amortization related for income taxes, and an increase in deferred revenue of $14.4 million primarily due to billings for annual service contracts under our expanded installed base of digital mammography systems.
