Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those listed under “Risks Factors.” This section of this report generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this report can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes. Our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including architecture, building construction, civil engineering, geospatial, survey and mapping, agriculture, natural resources, utilities, transportation, and government. Our representative customers include construction owners, contractors, engineering and construction firms, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, energy and utility companies, trucking companies, and state, federal, and municipal governments. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this report.
Our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:
•Executing on our Connect and Scale strategy;
•Increasing focus on software and services;
•Focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential;
•Domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base;
•Geographic expansion with localization strategy;
•Optimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets;
•Strategic acquisitions and venture fund investments; and
•Sustainability.
Our focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model. We continue to experience a shift toward a more significant mix of recurring revenue contracts, as demonstrated by our success in driving annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”) of $1,603.7 million, which represents growth of 14% year-over-year at the end of 2022. ARR organic growth was 16%. This shift towards recurring revenue has positively impacted our revenue mix and growth over time and is leading to improved visibility in our businesses. As our solutions have expanded, our go-to-market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct, distribution, and OEM customers as well as an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.
Throughout this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, we refer to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure. For a full definition of ARR, organic ARR, and organic revenue growth as used in this discussion and analysis, refer to the “Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Annualized Recurring Revenue” found later in this Item 7.
Impact of Recent Events on Our Business
Macroeconomic conditions, including geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions, exchange rate and interest rate volatility, and inflationary pressures, will continue to evolve globally. In the second half of 2022, our organic hardware sales growth and bookings moderated from slowing demand in some of our end markets served by our dealer channels and also from dealer inventories moving towards lower levels due to improved product lead times and macroeconomic concerns. The greatest impact was a decline in Europe where the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, and energy inflation were the greatest.
Supply Chain
Over the past year, we experienced inflationary cost increases for certain components of our hardware products due to supply chain disruptions resulting from parts and labor shortages and an increase in worldwide demand for components. In response, we increased customer pricing to offset inflationary pressures. In the second half of 2022, these cost pressures lessened as component supply became more readily available. We expect these cost pressures will continue to diminish over time as supply chain conditions continue to normalize. Additionally, over the past year, due to extended component lead times, we made binding commitments over a longer horizon for certain components. This has impacted our working capital in the short term; however, we expect supply dynamics and customer demand to normalize over time.

Foreign Currency Fluctuations
We generate over half of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S. In 2022, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency impacts on revenue and operating income were $114.1 million or 4% and $26.0 million or 5%.
Interest Rates Fluctuations
The global inflation rate has risen sharply, and interest rates are rising in an effort to curb inflation. In addition to the negative impact macroeconomic conditions have had on our sales, we may experience higher borrowing costs on existing variable rate debt and future debt issuances, including financing related to the pending acquisition of Transporeon.
Ongoing Military Conflict in Ukraine
We are monitoring and responding to effects of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2022, we stopped selling to Russia and Belarus customers and wrote off uncollected customer receivables and inventory located in these countries, which was not material to our consolidated financial statements. Total revenue associated with Russia and Belarus customers, either sold directly or indirectly through resellers or OEMs, was less than 2% of our total Company revenue for 2021. We are focused on providing products and support to non-sanctioned Ukrainian customers and contributing to relief efforts.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
We acquire businesses that align with our long-term growth strategies including our strategic product roadmap and, conversely, we divest certain business that no longer fit those strategies.
In December 2022, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Transporeon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately €1.88 billion or $2.0 billion. Transporeon, a Germany-based company, is a leading cloud-based transportation management software platform that connects key stakeholders across the industry lifecycle to positively impact the optimization of global supply chains, in alignment with our Connect and Scale strategy. We believe the acquisition will advance our sustainability strategy by reducing under-utilized carrier capacity and “empty miles” and increase our international footprint and long-term Transportation opportunities. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. We expect this acquisition to close in the first half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of merger control clearances in Austria, Germany, and Poland. Transporeon will be reported in our Transportation segment.
In 2022, we acquired two businesses, with total purchase consideration of $379.5 million. In the aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed less than 1% of our total revenue during 2022.
In 2022, we divested six businesses with total proceeds of $226.3 million. For 2021, the revenue and operating income for these divested businesses were approximately $201.7 million and $33.0 million.
 For additional discussion of acquisitions and divestitures, refer to Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” of this report.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs of sales, operating expenses, and related disclosures. We consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 “Description of Business and Accounting Policies” of this report.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.
Judgment is required to determine stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.

Income Taxes
We are a U.S. based multinational company operating in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.
We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
For business combinations, we allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest based on their fair values at the acquisition date. When determining the fair values, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially concerning intangible assets. Critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Any purchase consideration in excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in our fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we first assess qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, or other relevant company-specific events. If it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a goodwill reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative analysis. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
When performing a quantitative approach, we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair value. The estimation of a reporting unit's fair value involves using estimates and assumptions, including expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates. If the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows. The estimated future cash flows are primarily based on assumptions about expected future operating performance.

Basis of Presentation
We use a 52–53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest to December 31, which for 2022 was December 30, 2022. Both 2022 and 2021 were 52–week years.

Year 2022 Compared with Year 2021

 2022
Change versus 2021 % Change

Change in total revenue — %
Acquisitions 1 %
Divestitures (4) %
Foreign currency exchange (4) %
Organic revenue growth - total revenue 7 %

Although organic revenue increased for fiscal 2022, it decelerated in the second half of the year due to slowing demand in some of our end markets and reductions in dealer inventory levels as a result of improved product lead times and macroeconomic concerns. Additionally, Geospatial had unusually strong hardware sales in the previous year. Throughout the year, software and subscription sales were strong in buildings businesses in Buildings and Infrastructure, and to a lesser extent, positioning services in Resources and Utilities and Transportation enterprise business, as evidenced by organic ARR growth of 16%.

Organic product revenue increased due to term license software growth throughout the year, as well as stronger hardware and related software sales in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, slowing demand for our hardware and related software products impacted sales in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. Organic service revenue was relatively flat. Organic subscription revenue increased primarily due to strong growth in Buildings and Infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, in Resources and Utilities, Transportation, and Geospatial.
During 2022, sales to customers in North America represented 53%; Europe represented 28%; Asia Pacific represented 11%; and the rest of world represented 8% of our total revenue.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue or accounts receivable in 2022 and 2021.
Gross Margin
Gross margins varied due to several factors including product mix, customer pricing, distribution channel, and product costs.
Gross margin increased primarily due to organic revenue growth in Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities, partially offset by divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased due to an increased mix of software and subscription sales, price increases, and to a lesser extent, divestitures of lower margin hardware centric businesses.
Operating Income
Operating income decreased primarily due to divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by organic revenue and gross margin expansion. Additionally, operating expense increased due to investments related to our Connect and Scale strategy and increased sales and marketing costs primarily related to trade shows and increased travel. Other contributors to increased operating expense included restructuring costs, charitable donations, and higher acquisition and divestiture transaction costs partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation.
Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to increased operating expense, partially offset by increased gross margin as a percentage of revenue.

Research and Development, Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses
The following table shows research and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”), and general and administrative (“G&A”) expense along with these expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:

-------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ----- - ------------- -------- - ----- - - -

Percentage of revenue 11.5 % 10.1 %
Total $ 1,517.9 $ 1,412.5 $ 105.4 7 %

R&D expense increased primarily due to slightly higher compensation expense and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by favorable foreign currency and divestitures. We believe that the development and introduction of new solutions are critical to our future success, and we expect to continue the active development of new products.
S&M expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense, including commissions, higher marketing costs including trade shows, higher travel expenses, and the impact of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency and divestitures.
G&A expense increased primarily due to investments related to our Connect and Scale strategy, charitable donations to the Trimble Foundation, and acquisition and divestiture transaction costs. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation, favorable foreign currency, and divestitures.
Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets
The following table shows amortization of purchased intangible assets for the periods indicated:

Income Tax Provision
Our effective income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 21.0% and 14.2%. The effective income tax rate in 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2021 related to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets mentioned below and lower stock-based compensation deductions during 2022.
In December 2021, due to a change in the Netherlands tax law, the statutory tax rate was increased from 25.0% to 25.8% effective January 1, 2022. As a result, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $14.4 million in 2021 due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022. The IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax effective in 2024 for certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. We do not expect the provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our financial results.

Results by Segment
We report our financial performance, including revenue and operating income, based on four reportable segments: Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system. These results are not necessarily in conformance with U.S. GAAP. For additional discussion of our segments, refer to Note 6 “Reporting Segment and Geographic Information” of this report.

 2022
Change versus 2021 % Change

Change in revenue - Buildings and Infrastructure 5 %
Acquisitions 2 %
Divestitures (5) %
Foreign currency exchange (3) %
Organic revenue growth 11 %

Organic revenue increased due to demand for our subscription and term license software recurring offerings. The increases resulted from higher sales to new and existing customers, as well as conversions from perpetual software to recurring offerings. Civil construction hardware and related software license revenue increased due to relative strength in the North American construction market in the first half of 2022, partially offset by weaker hardware sales, particularly in Europe, in the second half of the year.
Despite revenue and gross margin expansion, operating income decreased primarily due to higher operating expense, unfavorable foreign currency, and divestitures. Operating expense increased due to investments in our Connect and Scale strategy as well as higher marketing and travel costs. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher operating expense, partially offset by gross margin expansion due to product mix.

Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (54.7) $ 88.0

Operating Activities
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items and divestiture gains, higher bonus and cash tax payments, higher accounts receivable, higher inventory purchases, and lower accounts payable associated with the timing of inventory payments. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue.

42

Table of Contents
Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher payments related to businesses acquired in 2022, partially offset by higher proceeds from divestitures.
Financing Activities
The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher proceeds of revolving credit facilities, which was used in part to fund the B2W acquisition, partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, along with cash provided by operations will be sufficient in the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, expenditures related to our Connect and Scale strategy, and debt service. In March 2022, we entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving loan facility for borrowings up to $1.25 billion, which replaced the 2018 Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility contains an option to increase the borrowings up to $1.75 billion with lender approval. At the end of 2022, $225.0 million was outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility.
In December 2022, in connection with our pending acquisition of Transporeon, we arranged to incur substantial new debt obligations, which will be drawn prior to the acquisition closing date. These arrangements include:
•a term loan credit agreement providing for an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, comprised of commitments for a 3-year tranche in the amount of $500.0 million and a 5-year tranche in the amount of $500.0 million, and
•an amendment to our 2022 Credit Facility that made $600.0 million of the existing commitments under the Credit Facility available for the pending acquisition of Transporeon and increased our maximum permitted leverage ratio following the closing of the acquisition.
Prior to arranging the above two transactions, we had entered into a 364-day bridge facility commitment letter (the “Bridge Facility”) that provided for up to €1.88 billion of commitments for term loans to fund our acquisition of Transporeon. The Bridge Facility was reduced to €500 million by the term loan credit agreement and the amended 2022 Credit Facility.
We anticipate refinancing some or all of our outstanding indebtedness and debt commitments at or prior to their maturities, which could involve us accessing the capital markets.
A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and development costs for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. In 2022, we paid $88.0 million with respect to this tax provision. Additionally, if this provision is not deferred or repealed in 2023, we expect that cash tax payments in 2023 will be slightly lower than 2022.
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations and cash needs:
Leases
We have operating leases primarily for certain of our major facilities including corporate offices, research and development facilities, and manufacturing facilities. Operating leases represent undiscounted lease payments and include short-term leases. At the end of 2022, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $171.6 million, with $48.7 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Note 8 “Leases” of this report for additional information regarding our leases.
Tax Payable
At the end of 2022, we had income taxes payable of $64.6 million, with $23.7 million payable within the next 12 months. The amount payable within the next 12 months includes $13.6 million representing a one-time transition tax liability as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
In addition, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $75.5 million included in Other non-current liabilities, including interest and penalties. At this time, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability. Refer to Note 12 “Income Taxes” of this report for additional information regarding our taxes.
Other Purchase Obligations and Commitments
Purchase obligations and commitments primarily relate to investments in our platform associated with our Connect and Scale strategy and non-cancellable inventory commitments. At the end of 2022, we had operating purchase obligations and commitments of $858.8 million, with $326.2 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” of this report for additional information regarding our purchase obligations and commitments. Other than the items discussed above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities.

Debt
At the end of 2022, we had outstanding floating and fixed-rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.5 billion. Future interest payments total $260.5 million, with $67.3 million payable within the next 12 months.
During 2022, we had $224.6 million of proceeds from debt, net of the payments. Refer to Note 7 “Debt” of this report for additional information regarding our debt.
Stock Repurchase Program
We have a 2021 Stock Repurchase Program authorized by our Board of Directors, that allows us to repurchase shares from time to time, subject to business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, or by other means for up to $750 million. The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Because of the additional outstanding indebtedness we have and expect to incur in connection with the pending Transporeon acquisition, we have temporarily discontinued share repurchases. Refer to Note 14 “Common Stock Repurchase” of this report for additional information regarding our 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND ANNUALIZED RECURRING REVENUE
To supplement our consolidated financial information, we include non-GAAP financial measures, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP. We believe non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding our “core operating performance”, which excludes the (i) effect of non-cash items and certain variable charges not expected to recur; and (ii) transactions that are not meaningful in comparison to our past operating performance or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Lastly, we believe that our core operating performance offers a supplemental measure for period-to-period comparisons and can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as our performance relative to competitors.
Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that refers to revenue excluding the impacts of (i) foreign currency translation, and (ii) acquisitions and divestitures. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that are not indicative of ongoing performance or impact comparability with the prior year. We provide a reconciliation tables showing the change in revenue growth to organic revenue growth in the “Results of Operations” section found earlier in this Item 7.
In addition to providing non-GAAP financial measures, we disclose Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) to give the investors supplementary indicators of the value of our current recurring revenue contracts. ARR represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue, including subscription, maintenance and support revenue, and term license contracts for the quarter. ARR is calculated by taking our non-GAAP recurring revenue for the current quarter and adding the portion of the contract value of all of our term licenses attributable to the current quarter, and dividing that sum by the number of days in the quarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365. Organic ARR refers to annualized recurring revenue excluding the impacts of (i) foreign currency translation, and (ii) acquisitions and divestitures. ARR and organic ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as they are performance measures and are not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items.
The non-GAAP financial measures, definitions, and explanations to the adjustments to comparable GAAP measures are included below:

Table of Contents
Non-GAAP Definitions
Non-GAAP revenue
We define Non-GAAP revenue as GAAP revenue, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions occurring prior to 2021. We believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business including acquisitions, as non-GAAP revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting. Management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and trends.
Non-GAAP gross margin
We define Non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross margin, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs. We believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions, and manufacturing costs influence our business.
Non-GAAP operating expenses
We define Non-GAAP operating expenses as GAAP operating expenses, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs. We believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-GAAP spending in relation to revenue.
Non-GAAP operating income
We define Non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring, and other costs. We believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating income trends, which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending.
Non-GAAP non-operating expense, net
We define Non-GAAP non-operating expenses, net as GAAP non-operating expenses, net, excluding acquisition/divestiture items, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs. We believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non-operating expense trends.
Non-GAAP income tax provision
We define Non-GAAP income tax provision as GAAP income tax provision, excluding charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, tax law changes, and significant one-time reserve releases upon the statute of limitations expirations. We believe this measure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our non-GAAP presentation and a difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates.
Non-GAAP net income
We define Non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments. This measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends, which are driven by non-GAAP income before taxes and our non-GAAP tax rate.
Non-GAAP diluted net income per share
We define Non-GAAP diluted net income per share as GAAP diluted net income per share, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments. We believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-GAAP operating performance by ownership in the company.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation expense, cloud computing amortization, and income from equity method investments, net. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operations of our business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons by removing

potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of purchased intangibles and cloud computing costs.
Explanations of Non-GAAP adjustments
(A)Purchase accounting adjustments. Purchase accounting adjustments consist of the following:
(i)Acquired deferred revenue adjustment. We adopted ASU 2021-08 in the fourth quarter of 2021 for all acquisitions occurring in 2021 and going forward, which requires the application of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities on the acquisition date. For acquisitions occurring prior to 2021, non-GAAP revenue excludes the adjustment to our revenue as a result of measuring the contract liability at fair value on the acquisition date.
(ii)Amortization of acquired capitalized commissions. Purchase accounting generally requires entities to eliminate capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the adjustments that eliminate the capitalized sales commissions. For acquisitions occurring prior to 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the adjustment of acquired capitalized commissions amortization.
(iii)Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed.
(B)Acquisition / divestiture items. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude acquisition costs consisting of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, including the acceleration of acquisition stock options and adjustments to the fair value of earn-out liabilities. Non-GAAP non-operating expense, net, excludes unusual one-time acquisition/divestiture charges, including foreign currency exchange rate gains/losses related to an acquisition, divestiture gains/losses, and strategic investment impairments. These are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
(C)Stock-based compensation / deferred compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation and income or expense associated with movement in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. Changes in non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets, included in non-operating expense, net, offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities.
(D)Restructuring and other costs. Non- GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude restructuring and other costs comprised of termination benefits related to reductions in employee headcount and closure or exit of facilities, executive severance agreements, costs incurred in exiting business activities in Russia and Belarus, other business exit costs, Bridge Facility fees, as well as a $20 million commitment to donate to the Trimble Foundation to be paid over four quarters.
(E)Non-GAAP items tax effected. This amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP items (A) - (D) on non-GAAP net income. This amount excludes the GAAP tax rate impact resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in item (G).
(F)Difference in GAAP and Non-GAAP tax rate. This amount represents the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates applied to the non-GAAP operating income plus the non-GAAP non-operating expense, net. The GAAP tax rate used for this calculation excludes the net deferred tax impacts resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in item (G). The non-GAAP tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property and significant one-time reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations.
(G)IP restructuring and tax law change impacts. These amounts represent net deferred tax impacts resulting from a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, consistent with tax law changes, including tax rates changes, and our international business operations.
(H)GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate percentages. These percentages are defined as GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of GAAP income before taxes and non-GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of non-GAAP income before taxes.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes. Our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including architecture, building construction, civil engineering, geospatial, survey and mapping, agriculture, natural resources, utilities, transportation, and government. Our representative customers include construction owners, contractors, engineering and construction firms, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, energy and utility companies, trucking companies, and state, federal, and municipal governments. Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this report.
Our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:
•Executing on our Connect and Scale strategy;
•Increasing focus on software and services;
•Focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential;
•Domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base;
•Geographic expansion with localization strategy;
•Optimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets;
•Strategic acquisitions and venture fund investments; and
•Sustainability.
Our focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model. We continue to experience a shift toward a more significant mix of recurring revenue contracts, as demonstrated by our success in driving annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”) of $1,603.7 million, which represents growth of 14% year-over-year at the end of 2022. ARR organic growth was 16%. This shift towards recurring revenue has positively impacted our revenue mix and growth over time and is leading to improved visibility in our businesses. As our solutions have expanded, our go-to-market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct, distribution, and OEM customers as well as an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.
Throughout this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, we refer to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure. For a full definition of ARR, organic ARR, and organic revenue growth as used in this discussion and analysis, refer to the “Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Annualized Recurring Revenue” found later in this Item 7.
Impact of Recent Events on Our Business
Macroeconomic conditions, including geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions, exchange rate and interest rate volatility, and inflationary pressures, will continue to evolve globally. In the second half of 2022, our organic hardware sales growth and bookings moderated from slowing demand in some of our end markets served by our dealer channels and also from dealer inventories moving towards lower levels due to improved product lead times and macroeconomic concerns. The greatest impact was a decline in Europe where the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, and energy inflation were the greatest.
Supply Chain
Over the past year, we experienced inflationary cost increases for certain components of our hardware products due to supply chain disruptions resulting from parts and labor shortages and an increase in worldwide demand for components. In response, we increased customer pricing to offset inflationary pressures. In the second half of 2022, these cost pressures lessened as component supply became more readily available. We expect these cost pressures will continue to diminish over time as supply chain conditions continue to normalize. Additionally, over the past year, due to extended component lead times, we made binding commitments over a longer horizon for certain components. This has impacted our working capital in the short term; however, we expect supply dynamics and customer demand to normalize over time.

Foreign Currency Fluctuations
We generate over half of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S. In 2022, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency impacts on revenue and operating income were $114.1 million or 4% and $26.0 million or 5%.
Interest Rates Fluctuations
The global inflation rate has risen sharply, and interest rates are rising in an effort to curb inflation. In addition to the negative impact macroeconomic conditions have had on our sales, we may experience higher borrowing costs on existing variable rate debt and future debt issuances, including financing related to the pending acquisition of Transporeon.
Ongoing Military Conflict in Ukraine
We are monitoring and responding to effects of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2022, we stopped selling to Russia and Belarus customers and wrote off uncollected customer receivables and inventory located in these countries, which was not material to our consolidated financial statements. Total revenue associated with Russia and Belarus customers, either sold directly or indirectly through resellers or OEMs, was less than 2% of our total Company revenue for 2021. We are focused on providing products and support to non-sanctioned Ukrainian customers and contributing to relief efforts.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
We acquire businesses that align with our long-term growth strategies including our strategic product roadmap and, conversely, we divest certain business that no longer fit those strategies.
In December 2022, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Transporeon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately €1.88 billion or $2.0 billion. Transporeon, a Germany-based company, is a leading cloud-based transportation management software platform that connects key stakeholders across the industry lifecycle to positively impact the optimization of global supply chains, in alignment with our Connect and Scale strategy. We believe the acquisition will advance our sustainability strategy by reducing under-utilized carrier capacity and “empty miles” and increase our international footprint and long-term Transportation opportunities. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. We expect this acquisition to close in the first half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of merger control clearances in Austria, Germany, and Poland. Transporeon will be reported in our Transportation segment.
In 2022, we acquired two businesses, with total purchase consideration of $379.5 million. In the aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed less than 1% of our total revenue during 2022.
In 2022, we divested six businesses with total proceeds of $226.3 million. For 2021, the revenue and operating income for these divested businesses were approximately $201.7 million and $33.0 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs of sales, operating expenses, and related disclosures. We consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 “Description of Business and Accounting Policies” of this report.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.
Judgment is required to determine stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.

Income Taxes
We are a U.S. based multinational company operating in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.
We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
For business combinations, we allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest based on their fair values at the acquisition date. When determining the fair values, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially concerning intangible assets. Critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Any purchase consideration in excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in our fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we first assess qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, or other relevant company-specific events. If it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a goodwill reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative analysis. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
When performing a quantitative approach, we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit']:
