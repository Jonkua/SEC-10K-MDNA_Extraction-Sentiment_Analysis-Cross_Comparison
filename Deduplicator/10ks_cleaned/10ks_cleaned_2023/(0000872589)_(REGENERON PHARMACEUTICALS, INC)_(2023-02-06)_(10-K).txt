Credit Quality Risk
We have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and concentration and diversification. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not record any charges for credit-related impairments of our available-for-sale debt securities.
We are subject to credit risk associated with the receivables due from our collaborators, including Bayer and Sanofi. We are also subject to credit risk in connection with trade accounts receivable due from our customers from our product sales. We have contractual payment terms with each of our collaborators and customers. We also monitor financial performance and credit worthiness so that we can properly assess and respond to any changes in collaborator and/or customer credit profiles. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not recognize any charges for write-offs and allowances of accounts receivable related to credit risk for our collaborators or customers. As of December 31, 2022, two customers accounted on a combined basis for 86% of our net trade accounts receivables.
Foreign Exchange Risk
As discussed further above, our collaborators market certain products outside the United States, and we share in profits and losses with these collaborators from commercialization of products. In addition, pursuant to the applicable terms of the agreements with our collaborators, we also share in certain worldwide development expenses incurred by our collaborators.
We also incur worldwide development expenses for clinical products we are developing independently, incur expenses outside of the United States in connection with our international operations, and, effective July 1, 2022, market Libtayo outside of the United States as a result of obtaining worldwide rights to Libtayo under an A&R IO LCA with Sanofi.
Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates of the countries outside the United States where our products are sold, where development expenses are incurred by us or our collaborators, or where we incur operating expenses can impact our operating results and financial condition. As sales outside the United States continue to grow, and as we expand our international operations, we will continue to assess potential steps, including foreign currency hedging and other strategies, to mitigate our foreign exchange risk.
Market Price Risk
We are exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our investment portfolio. Our marketable securities include equity investments in publicly traded stock of companies, including common stock of companies with which we have entered into collaboration arrangements. Changes in the fair value of our equity investments are included in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recorded $39.8 million of net unrealized losses and $386.1 million of net unrealized gains on equity securities in Other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
