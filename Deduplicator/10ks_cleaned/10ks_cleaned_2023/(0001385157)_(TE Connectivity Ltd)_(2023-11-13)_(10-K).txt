Overview
We are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.
Summary of Fiscal 2023 Performance
 ● Our fiscal 2023 net sales decreased 1.5% from fiscal 2022 levels due to sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment, partially offset by sales increases in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 1.0% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $306 million in net sales.

 ● Our net sales by segment were as follows:

 ● Transportation Solutions—Our net sales increased 4.0% due primarily to sales increases in the automotive end market.

 ● Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 1.4% as a result of sales increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine, the energy, and the medical end markets, partially offset by declines in the industrial equipment end market.

 ● Communications Solutions—Our net sales decreased 26.3% due to sales declines in both the data and devices and the appliances end markets.

 ● During fiscal 2023, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.36 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.59 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

 ● Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,132 million in fiscal 2023.

Economic Conditions
Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted in recent years by supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures as well as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.
We have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through price increases or productivity. We have implemented select price increases for certain products. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
We continue to monitor the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, escalating tensions in surrounding countries, and associated sanctions. We sold our business operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine have been reduced. Neither Russia nor Ukraine represents a material portion of our business, and the military conflict did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during fiscal 2023 and 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns, including systemic disruptions of global supply chains. While the pandemic impacted certain aspects of our business, the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the resurgence of the spread of the virus and variant strains of the virus as well as the success of public health advancements. Certain of our operations in China were impacted in early fiscal 2023 and were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022; however, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term.

Outlook
In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect our net sales to be approximately $3.85 billion as compared to $3.84 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments are expected to be largely offset by sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.59 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This outlook reflects the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which is a positive impact of approximately $17 million on net sales and a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share on earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.
Acquisitions
During fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $110 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
We acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $245 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2022. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Communications Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.
Pending Acquisition
In August 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to launch a public tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Schaffner Holding AG (“Schaffner”), a leader in electromagnetic solutions based in Switzerland, for CHF 505.00 per share in cash for a fair value of approximately CHF 320 million (equivalent to approximately $350 million). The tender offer commenced in September 2023. As of November 10, 2023, the completion of the initial offer period, the offer has been accepted for approximately 89% of Schaffner’s outstanding shares. The offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
Divestitures
During fiscal 2023, we sold three businesses for net cash proceeds of $48 million. In connection with the divestitures, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges and a net pre-tax loss on sales, which totaled to a net charge of $9 million. The businesses sold were reported in our Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $68 million in connection with a held for sale business in our Transportation Solutions segment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.

Net sales decreased $247 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease in net sales resulted primarily from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.6% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies, partially offset by organic net sales growth of 1.0%. In fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $607 million. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $306 million in net sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average sales figure for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”
Net Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regions—EMEA, Asia–Pacific, and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2023. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2023 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

As a percentage of net sales ​ 31.5 % ​ 32.2 % ​ ​

 (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week.

In fiscal 2023, gross margin decreased $189 million as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher material and operating costs, lower volume, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing actions.
We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. As a result, we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials—including certain metals—however, we have been able to initiate pricing actions to offset these impacts. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, silver, and palladium:
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

Silver ​ Troy oz. ​ ​ 23.33 ​ ​ 24.23 ​
Palladium Troy oz. ​ 2,162 ​ 2,337 ​

​
In fiscal 2023, we purchased approximately 181 million pounds of copper, 112,000 troy ounces of gold, 2.4 million troy ounces of silver, and 7,000 troy ounces of palladium. We expect to purchase approximately 180 million pounds of copper, 110,000 troy ounces of gold, 2.0 million troy ounces of silver, and 12,000 troy ounces of palladium in fiscal 2024.

 (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. In fiscal 2023, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $86 million as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to gains on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2022 and the impact of cost inflation, partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.

Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.
During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we initiated restructuring programs associated with cost structure improvements across all segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of $260 million in fiscal 2023 and net restructuring and related charges of $153 million, of which $16 million was recorded in cost of sales, in fiscal 2022. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $200 million and are expected to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2024, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $100 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $175 million.
During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded net charges of $77 million and $4 million, respectively, related to pre-tax impairment of held for sale businesses and loss (gain) on divestitures.
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Interest Income and Expense. Interest income increased $45 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 due to higher interest rates as well as an increase in our cash balances held and invested. In fiscal 2023, interest expense increased $14 million as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of a higher average cost of debt due to rising interest rates, partially offset by the expansion of our cross-currency swap program that hedges our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was $3,806 million at fiscal year end 2023. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 1.6% per annum and pay no interest. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our cross-currency swap program.
Other Income (Expense). We recorded net periodic pension benefit cost of $16 million and credit of $25 million in net other income (expense) in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our retirement plans. Also, in fiscal 2022, we recorded other income of $11 million related to an indemnification receivable associated with an income tax audit. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Income Taxes. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of items impacting income tax expense and the effective tax rate.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and participating countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax. Member states have begun to enact the rules. Swiss Parliament recently approved a constitutional amendment to implement the rules, and the amendment was approved by public vote in June 2023. We anticipate that the Swiss global minimum tax will be effective as of January 1, 2024. The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which is expected to affect us beginning in fiscal 2025. Although global enactment has begun, the OECD and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. We are currently monitoring these developments and evaluating the impact, which could be material to our results of operations, cash taxes, and worldwide corporate effective tax rate.
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $7,416 million and $7,112 million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
As of fiscal year end 2023, certain subsidiaries had approximately $38.0 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.

Net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $369 million, or 4.0%, in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 as a result of organic net sales growth of 7.2%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 3.2%. In fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $375 million. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $180 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:
 ● Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 10.2% in fiscal 2023 with increases of 13.5% in the EMEA region, 11.9% in the Americas region, and 6.5% in the Asia–Pacific region. Our organic net sales growth across all regions resulted from global vehicle production growth as well as increased content per vehicle.

 ● Commercial transportation—Our organic net sales decreased 1.1% in fiscal 2023 due to declines in the Asia–Pacific and Americas regions, partially offset by growth in the EMEA region.

 ● Sensors—Our organic net sales increased 1.8% in fiscal 2023 due to growth in transportation applications, partially offset by declines in industrial applications.

In the Industrial Solutions segment, net sales increased $61 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 due primarily to organic net sales growth of 3.4%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 1.7%. In fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $242 million. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $84 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:
 ● Industrial equipment—Our organic net sales decreased 8.1% in fiscal 2023 as a result of declines across all regions with reduced demand resulting from inventory corrections in the supply chain.

 ● Aerospace, defense, and marine—Our organic net sales increased 12.8% in fiscal 2023 due primarily to growth in the defense market and, to a lesser degree, the commercial aerospace market.

 ● Energy—Our organic net sales increased 9.6% in fiscal 2023 due to growth across all regions and strength in renewable energy applications.

 ● Medical—Our organic net sales increased 13.1% in fiscal 2023 primarily as a result of growth in interventional medical applications.

Net sales in the Communications Solutions segment decreased $677 million, or 26.3%, in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to organic net sales declines of 25.2%. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $42 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:
 ● Data and devices—Our organic net sales decreased 27.2% in fiscal 2023 due to reduced demand resulting from inventory corrections in the supply chain and market declines.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the pending acquisition of Schaffner and payment of $350 million of 3.45% senior notes due in August 2024. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs.
As of fiscal year end 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2023, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $664 million to $3,132 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to $2,468 million in fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from the impact of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by lower pre-tax income. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $425 million and $421 million, respectively.

Table of Contents

Pension contributions were $71 million and $42 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be $70 million in fiscal 2024, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. For additional information regarding pensions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Capital expenditures were $732 million and $768 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect fiscal 2024 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.
During fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $110 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $245 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2022. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.
During fiscal 2023, we received net cash proceeds of $48 million related to the sale of three businesses. We received net cash proceeds of $16 million related to the sale of two businesses during fiscal 2022. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization
Total debt at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022 was $4,211 million and $4,206 million, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.
During fiscal 2023, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due in February 2026. The notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2023 or 2022.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) (as defined in the Credit Facility), (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.’s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, (3) an alternative currency daily rate, or (4) an alternative currency term rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders’ commitments under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.
Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. At fiscal year end 2023, TEGSA had $330 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.50%. TEGSA had $370 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.45% at fiscal year end 2022.

Table of Contents

TEGSA’s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.
Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $725 million and $685 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares.
In March 2023, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.36 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.59 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.
Future dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.
We repurchased approximately 8 million of our common shares for $946 million and approximately 10 million of our common shares for $1,409 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. At fiscal year end 2023, we had $735 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
Summarized Guarantor Financial Information
As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries. The following tables present summarized financial information, excluding investments in and equity in earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, for TE Connectivity Ltd. and TEGSA on a combined basis.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2024 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
At fiscal year end 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $198 million, including letters of credit of $29 million associated with our divesture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, at fiscal year end 2023, we had $27 million of performance guarantees associated with that divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees.

(3) Operating leases represents the undiscounted lease payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases.

(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

(5) The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $454 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $65 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties.

(6) The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $70 million to pension plans in fiscal 2024, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments.

(7) The above table does not reflect redeemable noncontrolling interests of $104 million associated with our First Sensor AG (“First Sensor”) subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest holders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor noncontrolling interest shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of €0.56 per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of €33.27 per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Legal Proceedings
In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and

Table of Contents

use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Trade Compliance Matters
We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.
Revenue Recognition
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.
Our standard terms of sale generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. In certain instances, we may sell products to customers under terms other than our standard terms. We do not account for warranties as separate performance obligations.
Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.
Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.
We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a “component”) if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2023, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.
Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.
When testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
Fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and determined that no impairment existed.
Income Taxes
In determining pre-tax income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the

39

Table of Contents

valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.
Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Pension Plans
Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustees of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.
Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.
Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are discount rates and expected long-term returns on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. Discount rates represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and are used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in discount rates increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2023, a 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $60 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $57 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term returns on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2023 pension expense by $8 million.
At fiscal year end 2023, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans’ master trust is 25% return-seeking assets and 75% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2023, our target asset allocation is 67% return-seeking and 33% liability-hedging.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline)
We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements in this Annual Report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...
