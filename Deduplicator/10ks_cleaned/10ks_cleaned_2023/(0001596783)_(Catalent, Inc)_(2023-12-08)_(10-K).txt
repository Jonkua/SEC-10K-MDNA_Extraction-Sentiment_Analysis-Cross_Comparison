Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of this Annual Report, as well as the following:

Use of Constant Currency, Budget-Based Revenue, and Budget-Based EBITDA

When we set the financial goals that we use to operate the business, including the goals that our executives must meet to qualify for our fiscal 2021 performance-based incentive compensation, and when we determine whether those goals have been met, we use, among other metrics, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA computed using the currency exchange rates that we use internally in budgeting and in measuring performance against budget, in part because we believe that the compensation of our executives should not be affected, to the extent practicable, by factors beyond those executives’ control. We refer in this Annual Report to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA computed on this type of constant-currency basis as “Budget-Based Revenue” and “Budget-Based EBITDA,” respectively.

168

Results on a constant-currency basis, Budget-Based Revenue, and Budget-Based EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results on a constant-currency basis, Budget-Based Revenue, and Budget-Based EBITDA, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA also includes a reconciliation to Budget-Based EBITDA. The reconciliation of fiscal 2023 consolidated net revenue reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to net revenue at budgeted foreign exchange rates is as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

Inter-company loans exist between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.

(2) Foreign exchange loss of $11 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, includes $10 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payable intercompany transactions.

 Foreign exchange loss of $31 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, includes: (a) $12 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables, (b) $11 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the euro-denominated debt, and (c) $34 million of unrealized losses on inter-company loans. The foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of inter-company loans of $2 million. Inter-company loans exist between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.

(3) We computed the tax effect of adjustments to net earnings by applying the statutory tax rate in the relevant jurisdictions to the income or expense items that are adjusted in the period presented. If a valuation allowance exists, the rate applied is zero.

(4) Discrete period income tax expense (benefit) items are unusual or infrequently occurring items, primarily including: changes in judgment related to the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, changes in measurement of a prior-year tax position, deferred tax impact of changes in tax law, and purchase accounting.

(6) Represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average sum of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, plus (b) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issued assuming exercise or vesting of all potentially dilutive instruments, plus, in fiscal 2022, (c) the number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding under the “if-converted” method. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average was 181 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan approved by security holders(4) - - 3,180,009

(1)    The amounts set forth in this row relate to grants under (a) our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2014 Omnibus Plan”), which was approved by a majority shareholder prior to our IPO, and (b) our 2018 Omnibus Plan together with the 2014 Omnibus Plan, the “Omnibus Plans”), which was approved by our shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

ITEM 13.    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Transactions with Related Persons

Our Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval, and ratification of transactions with related persons. This policy provides that a related person must promptly disclose to our Board any related person transaction. No related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our Board or the Audit Committee. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest if the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a “related person” has a direct or indirect material interest. In general, “related persons” are our directors and executive officers, shareholders beneficially owning more than 5% of our outstanding stock, and their immediate family members. We refer to such a transaction as a “related person transaction.”

Except as set forth below with respect to the Stockholders’ Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement (each as defined below), during fiscal 2023 we did not enter into or have outstanding any reportable related person transaction, nor is any related person transaction currently proposed, in which any of our directors, CEO, or executive officers has a direct or indirect material interest.

Stockholders’ Agreement

In connection with our sale of our formerly outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in May 2019, we entered into a stockholders’ agreement (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. that purchased those securities (the “Leonard Green Investors”). Pursuant to the Stockholders’ Agreement, as long as the holders of common stock issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Relevant Holders”) beneficially owned shares of common stock having an aggregate value of at least $250 million (measured in accordance with the Stockholders’ Agreement), they had the right to designate one nominee for election to our Board and certain customary access and information rights. Peter Zippelius was the designated director of the Relevant Holders; however, on December 14, 2022, Mr. Zippelius notified the Board of his intent to retire, which was made effective as of the end of January 2023 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stockholders’ Agreement. The Relevant Holders no longer hold shares of common stock converted from the Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate value in excess of $250 million, and, therefore, the right to designate a nominee has lapsed.

For so long as the Relevant Holders were entitled to designate a nominee, they were generally required to vote in the manner recommended by our Board in connection with director elections, our “say-on-pay” and other equity compensation proposals, ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and with respect to any proposed merger or other similar transaction between us and another party. The Relevant Holders were also subject to standstill restrictions that, subject to certain exceptions, prohibited them from purchasing our common stock, publicly proposing any merger or other

172

extraordinary corporate transaction, initiating any shareholder proposal, or soliciting proxies until the date on which they were no longer entitled to designate a nominee to our Board. Restrictions on the ability of the Relevant Holders to transfer the shares of common stock they hold that were issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock expired on November 17, 2021.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

We also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Leonard Green Investors, pursuant to which we must provide to the Leonard Green Investors certain customary registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock they hold that were issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Registration Rights Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including certain customary indemnification obligations.

The foregoing descriptions of the Stockholders’ Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, the full text of the Stockholders’ Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed with the SEC as exhibits to this Annual Report.

Director Independence

Our Governance Guidelines define an “independent” director in accordance with Section 303A.02 of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual. In addition, members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee are subject to the additional independence requirements of applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. Under our Governance Guidelines and the NYSE listing standards, a director is not independent if the director has or had certain specified relationships with us. As part of its process to approve for nomination the current slate of nominees, our Board determined that each of our director nominees is independent for purposes of our Governance Guidelines, applicable NYSE standards, and applicable SEC rules, including with respect to committee service, other than Mr. Maselli, who is also our CEO, and Mr. Greisch, who is our Executive Chair. The Board previously determined that each of our directors who is not seeking re-election at the Annual Meeting was independent, other than Ms. Flynn, due to her prior service as our Chief Commercial Officer and Interim President, Division Head for BioModalities. In addition, the Board had previously determined that Peter Zippelius, who retired from the Board effective January 31, 2023, was independent.

ITEM 14.    PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

The following table presents the fees for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young for the audit of our annual financial statements for the fiscal years that ended on June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and the fees billed for other services rendered by Ernst & Young during those same periods.

Tax Fees(3) $ 597,500 $ 1,283,700
All Other Fees(4) $ — $ —

Total $ 13,572,200 $ 7,879,000

(2) Includes the aggregate fees recognized in each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of our financial statements. Specifically, these costs include fees for accounting and audit consultation and other attest services.

(3) Includes the aggregate fees recognized in each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.

(4) Ernst & Young did not provide any “other services” during the last two fiscal years.

All of the services covered under the captions “Audit Fees,” “Audit-Related Fees,” and “Tax Fees” were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services

Consistent with requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent auditor. Accordingly, all audit and permitted non-audit services for which Ernst & Young was engaged were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

173

Prior to engagement of the independent auditor for 2024, management will submit for Audit Committee approval a list of services and related fees expected to be rendered in 2024 within each of the following categories of services:

• Audit services include audit work performed on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, and discussions surrounding the proper application of financial accounting and/or reporting standards.

• Audit-Related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.

• Tax services include all services, except those services specifically related to the financial statements, performed by the independent auditor’s tax personnel, including tax analysis; assisting with coordination of execution of tax-related activities, primarily in the area of corporate development; supporting other tax-related regulatory requirements; tax planning; and tax compliance and reporting.

• All Other services are those services not captured in the audit, audit-related or tax categories.
