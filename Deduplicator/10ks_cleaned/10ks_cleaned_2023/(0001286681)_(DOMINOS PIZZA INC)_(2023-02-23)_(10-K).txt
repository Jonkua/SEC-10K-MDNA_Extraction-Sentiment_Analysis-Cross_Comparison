Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

Our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter. Every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra (or 53rd) week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 each consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2020 consisted of 53 weeks.

In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022. For a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.

Description of the Business

Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 19,800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of January 1, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, we are a highly-recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino’s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of January 1, 2023.

Our business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.

Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family conveniently and economically.

Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment.

Our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders.

Critical accounting estimates

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period.

33

We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are:

Long-lived assets

We record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. For acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. We depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. We evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Our periodic evaluation is based on various analyses, including, on an annual basis, the projection of undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable, we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. For Company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

We have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of Company-owned stores during the years presented. Same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in determining projected cash flows used to evaluate recoverability of the related assets. If our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our Company-owned stores, by market, may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. There were no triggering events in 2022, 2021 or 2020, and accordingly, we did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Casualty insurance reserves

For certain periods prior to December 1998 and for periods after December 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned auto liabilities. We are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. We are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. The related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. There is inherent uncertainty in the ultimate cost for known claims under our insurance coverages, and for incidents that have occurred that will be subject to a claim, but have yet to be reported to us. Analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported. When estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.

Our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. Management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our casualty insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. A 10% change in our casualty insurance liability at January 1, 2023 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $5.8 million in 2022. We had accruals for casualty insurance reserves of $57.6 million and $56.5 million at January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively.

34

Income taxes

The U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate was 21% in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our Federal income tax provision calculated based on the Federal statutory rate was $120.3 million, $131.4 million and $116.6 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We measure deferred taxes using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred taxes. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. On an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate of future events. Except with respect to certain foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separately filed states, our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. As of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, we had total foreign tax credits of $13.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively, each of which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance. We also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of $1.5 million and $1.2 million as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. We believe our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. Changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Fiscal 2022 Highlights

•
Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores worldwide) increased 3.9% as compared to 2021. U.S. retail sales increased 1.3% and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 6.3% each as compared to 2021.

•
Same store sales declined 0.8% in our U.S. stores and increased 0.1% in our international stores, excluding foreign currency impact.

•
Revenues increased 4.1%.

•
Income from operations decreased 1.6%.

•
Net income decreased 11.4%.

•
Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.5%.

Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino’s experienced global retail sales growth during 2022. U.S. same store sales declined 0.8% during 2022, rolling over an increase in U.S. same store sales of 3.5% in 2021. The decline in U.S. same store sales in 2022 was attributable to lower order counts due in part to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets and economic stimulus activity in the U.S in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which did not recur in 2022. A higher average ticket per transaction resulting from higher menu and national offer pricing as well as increases to our average delivery fee partially offset the decline in U.S. same store sales in 2022. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 0.1% during 2022, rolling over an increase in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 8.0% in 2021. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) were pressured in 2022 due in part to a value added tax holiday in the United Kingdom in 2021 that expired during the first quarter of 2022. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity.

During fiscal 2022, we experienced significant inflationary pressures in our commodity, labor and fuel costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., which had a significant impact on our overall operating results as compared to 2021. Our overall operating results in fiscal 2022 were also negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the global macroeconomic environment.

During 2022, we continued our global expansion with the opening of 1,032 net stores. We had 126 net stores open in the U.S. comprised of 141 store openings and 15 closures. We had 906 net stores open internationally comprised of 1,135 store openings and 229 closures, primarily in Brazil, Russia and Italy.

We remained focused on improving the customer experience through our technology initiatives, including our GPS delivery tracking technology, which allows customers to monitor the progress of their food, from the preparation stages to the time it is in the oven to the time it arrives at their doors. Our emphasis on technological innovation helped the Domino’s system generate approximately two-thirds of global retail sales from digital channels in 2022. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand.

Statistical Measures

The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period.

Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact)

Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Global retail sales growth in 2021 and 2020 reflect the impact of the 53rd week in 2020.

-------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ------- ---- -------
 2022 2021 2020
U.S. stores + 1.3% + 4.3% + 17.6%
International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 6.3% + 13.9% + 8.8%
Total (excluding foreign currency impact) + 3.9% + 8.9% + 13.2%

Same Store Sales Growth

Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. The 53rd week in fiscal 2020 had no impact on reported same store sales growth amounts.

-------------------------------------------------------- ------ ------ -------
 2022 2021 2020
U.S. Company-owned stores (1) (2.6)% (3.6)% + 11.0%
U.S. franchise stores (1) (0.7)% + 3.9% + 11.5%
U.S. stores (0.8)% + 3.5% + 11.5%
International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 0.1% + 8.0% + 4.4%

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) During the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Purchase”). The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. Company-owned stores in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we refranchised 114 U.S. Company-owned stores (the “2022 Store Sale”). The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. franchise stores in 2022.

 2022 2021
U.S. Company-owned stores $ 445.8 9.8 % $ 479.0 11.0 %
U.S. franchise royalties and fees 556.3 12.3 % 539.9 12.4 %

Total revenues $ 4,537.2 100.0 % $ 4,357.4 100.0 %

Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.

Consolidated revenues increased $179.8 million, or 4.1%, in 2022 due primarily to higher supply chain revenues due to increases in our market basket pricing to stores. U.S. franchise royalties and fee revenues increased primarily due to retail sales growth resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale as well as an increase in revenues from fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, but were partially offset by lower same store sales and, to a lesser extent, the 2022 Store Purchase. U.S. franchise advertising revenues increased primarily due to retail sales growth resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale as well as lower advertising incentives related to brand promotions, but were partially offset by lower same store sales and, to a lesser extent, the 2022 Store Purchase. International franchise royalties and fee revenues declined primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. U.S. Company-owned store revenues declined primarily due to the 2022 Store Sale as well as lower same store sales, but were partially offset by higher revenues resulting from the 2022 Store Purchase. These changes in revenues are described in more detail below.

U.S. franchise advertising 485.3 32.6 % 479.5 32.0 %
Total U.S. stores revenues $ 1,487.4 100.0 % $ 1,498.4 100.0 %

U.S. Company-owned Stores

Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $33.2 million, or 6.9%, in 2022 primarily driven by the 2022 Store Sale. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues resulting from the 2022 Store Purchase. The decrease in U.S. Company-owned store revenue was also a result of lower U.S. Company-owned same store sales in 2022. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 2.6% in 2022 and declined 3.6% in 2021.

U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees

Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $16.4 million, or 3.0%, in 2022, due primarily to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth as well as an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. The 2022 Store Sale also contributed to the increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fee revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, the 2022 Store Purchase. U.S. franchise same store sales decreased 0.7% in 2022 and increased 3.9% in 2021.

U.S. Franchise Advertising

Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $5.8 million, or 1.2%, in 2022 due primarily to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale. Additionally, the Company recorded approximately $3.7 million less in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in 2022 as compared to 2021, which also contributed to the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, the 2022 Store Purchase.

Supply Chain

Supply chain revenues increased $193.8 million, or 7.6%, in 2022 due to higher market basket pricing to stores, and was partially offset by lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores during 2022. The market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 13.2% during 2022, which resulted in an estimated $296.1 million increase in supply chain revenues.

International Franchise Royalties and Fees

Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees decreased $3.0 million, or 1.0%, in 2022 due primarily to the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $28.4 million in 2022 which was partially offset by an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to U.S. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international same store sales increased 0.1% in 2022 and increased 8.0% in 2021.

Cost of Sales / Gross Margin

------------------- ---- ------- ---- ----- - - ------- ----- -
 2022 2021
Total revenues $ 4,537.2 100.0 % $ 4,357.4 100.0 %
Total cost of sales 2,888.6 63.7 % 2,669.1 61.3 %
Gross margin $ 1,648.6 36.3 % $ 1,688.2 38.7 %

Consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) decreased $39.6 million, or 2.3%, in 2022 due primarily to lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues, as well as higher food, delivery and labor costs. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar gross margins remain unchanged.

As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 36.3% in 2022 from 38.7% in 2021. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 6.7 percentage points in 2022 and supply chain gross margin decreased 1.5 percentage points in 2022. These changes in gross margin are described in more detail below.

Cost of sales 378.0 84.8 % 374.1 78.1 %
Store gross margin $ 67.8 15.2 % $ 104.9 21.9 %

U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $37.1 million, or 35.4%, in 2022 due primarily to the 2022 Store Sale and higher market basket prices and, to a lesser extent, higher occupancy costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower labor and delivery costs, primarily attributable to the decrease in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 Store Sale. As a percentage of U.S. Company-owned store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 6.7 percentage points in 2022. These changes in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below.

•
Food costs increased 3.3 percentage points to 31.4% in 2022 due to higher market basket prices.

•
Labor costs increased 1.5 percentage points to 30.5% in 2022 due primarily to continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores, as well as lower sales leverage.

•
Occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, increased 1.2 percentage points to 9.2% in 2022 due primarily to lower sales leverage, as well as higher utility rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores.

Revenues $ 2,754.7 100.0 % $ 2,561.0 100.0 %
Cost of sales 2,510.5 91.1 % 2,295.0 89.6 %
Supply chain gross margin $ 244.2 8.9 % $ 266.0 10.4 %

Supply chain gross margin decreased $21.7 million, or 8.2%, in 2022 due primarily to higher delivery and labor costs. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin decreased 1.5 percentage points in 2022, due primarily to higher food and delivery costs. The increases in food and delivery costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues resulted from macroeconomic inflationary pressures in the U.S., as well as lower sales leverage.

39

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses decreased $11.8 million, or 2.8%, in 2022 driven primarily by lower labor costs, partially offset by higher amortization expense for capitalized software.

U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses

U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $5.8 million, or 1.2%, in 2022 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues as discussed above. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes.

Refranchising Gain

During 2022, we completed the 2022 Store Sale in which we refranchised 114 U.S. Company-owned stores in Arizona and Utah for proceeds of $41.1 million. In connection with the 2022 Store Sale, we recorded a $21.2 million pre-tax refranchising gain on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including a $4.3 million reduction in goodwill.

Other Income

Other income was $36.8 million in 2021, representing the unrealized gains recorded on the Company’s investment in DPC Dash Ltd resulting from the observable changes in price from the valuation of the Company’s additional $40.0 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021 and the additional $9.1 million investment made in the fourth quarter of 2021. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $125.8 million in fiscal 2022.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net, increased $3.6 million, or 1.9%, in 2022 driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”), as well as borrowings on our variable funding notes. These increases were partially offset by higher interest income earned on our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents in 2022 as well as lower debt issuance cost expense recognized in 2022 due to the 2021 Recapitalization in which we expensed $2.0 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2017 Five-Year Notes and 2017 Floating Rate Notes (each defined in the “2017 Recapitalization” section, below). Our weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8% in both 2022 and 2021.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes increased $5.3 million, or 4.6% in 2022 due to a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by a decrease in income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 21.0% during 2022 as compared to 18.4% in 2021. The higher effective tax rate in 2022 was driven in part by a 2.6 percentage point change in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. The decrease in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation was a result of fewer stock option exercises in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was also a result of lower foreign tax credits in 2022. These increases were partially offset by the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits related to one of our foreign subsidiaries during 2022.

40

Segment Income

We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.

----------------------- ---- ----- - - ----- -
 2022 2021
U.S. Stores $ 438.6 $ 454.9
Supply Chain 208.8 229.9
International Franchise 236.1 241.9
Other (26.0 ) (42.9 )

U.S. Stores

U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $16.3 million, or 3.6%, in 2022, primarily as a result of the $37.1 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, and was partially offset by the increase in revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees of $16.4 million, each as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income.

Supply Chain

Supply chain Segment Income decreased $21.1 million, or 9.2%, in 2022 due primarily to the $21.7 million decrease in supply chain gross margin described above.

International Franchise

International franchise Segment Income decreased $5.7 million, or 2.4%, in 2022 due primarily to the $3.0 million decrease in international franchise revenues discussed above, as well as higher provision for losses on accounts receivable. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income.

Other

Other Segment Income increased $16.9 million, or 39.4%, in 2022 due primarily to lower labor costs as well as higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2021. The increase in allocated costs in 2022 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our U.S. and international franchise stores.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

COVID-19 Impact

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made certain investments related to safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for our franchisees and their communities. While we have seen an increase in sales in certain markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses, future sales are not possible to estimate and it is unclear whether and to what extent sales and same store sales will be impacted if and when consumer behavior and general economic and business activity return to pre-pandemic levels. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and, as a result, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

41

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of January 1, 2023, we had working capital of $58.0 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $191.3 million, advertising fund assets, restricted of $162.7 million and advertising fund liabilities of $157.9 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $60.4 million.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During 2022, we experienced global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, in both our U.S. and international businesses. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. The facilities include our 2022 Variable Funding Notes (defined in the “2022 Variable Funding Notes” section, below), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our 2021 Variable Funding Notes (defined in the “2021 Recapitalization” section, below), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (collectively, with the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, the “2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. During 2022, we borrowed and repaid $120.0 million under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. As of January 1, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $120.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 Variable Funding Notes. As of January 1, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.2 million.

We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock.

Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance the 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Notes and to service, extend or refinance the 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Restricted Cash

As of January 1, 2023, we had $141.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $49.9 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $191.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of January 1, 2023, we also held $143.6 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand.

Additional information related to our 2022 Variable Funding Notes is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

2021 Recapitalization

On April 16, 2021, we completed the 2021 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization.

Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes were $825.0 million. Additional information related to the 2018 Recapitalization is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

2017 Recapitalization

On July 24, 2017, we completed the 2017 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The notes consisted of $300.0 million Series 2017-1 Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of five years (the “2017 Floating Rate Notes”), $600.0 million Series 2017-1 3.082% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of five years (the “2017 Five-Year Notes”), and $1.0 billion Series 2017-1 4.118% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III with an anticipated term of 10 years (the “2017 Ten-Year Notes” and, collectively with the 2017 Floating Rate Notes and the 2017 Five-Year Notes, the “2017 Notes”).

Additional information related to the 2017 Recapitalization is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

43

2015 Recapitalization

On October 21, 2015, we completed the 2015 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The notes consisted of $500.0 million of Series 2015-1 3.484% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “2015 Five-Year Notes”), $800.0 million Series 2015-1 4.474% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “2015 Ten-Year Notes” and collectively with the 2015 Five-Year Notes, the “2015 Notes”). Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes were $1.3 billion. The 2015 Five-Year Notes were repaid in connection with the 2018 Recapitalization. Additional information related to the 2015 Recapitalization is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 Notes

The 2021 Notes, 2019 Notes, 2018 Notes, 2017 Notes and the 2015 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes.”

The Notes have original scheduled principal payments of $51.5 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. However, in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt, as defined, to adjusted EBITDA, as defined, and no catch-up provisions are applicable.

As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments in the second quarter of 2021.

The Notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the Notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule.

Leases

We lease certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, various equipment and our World Resource Center under leases with expiration dates through 2041. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our leases, including future minimum rental commitments.

Capital Expenditures

In the past three years, we have spent approximately $270.2 million on capital expenditures. In 2022, we spent $87.2 million on capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in our technology initiatives, including our proprietary internally developed point-of-sale system (Domino’s PULSE), our supply chain centers, new Company-owned stores and asset upgrades for our existing Company-owned stores and other assets. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 1, 2023.

Investments

During the second quarter of 2020, we acquired a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), a privately-held company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, for $40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, DPC Dash serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. Our investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments.

In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an additional $40.0 million in DPC Dash based on DPC Dash’s achievement of certain pre-established performance conditions and recorded a positive adjustment of $2.5 million to the original carrying amount of $40.0 million resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment, resulting in a net carrying amount of $82.5 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we invested an additional $9.1 million in DPC Dash and recorded a positive adjustment of $34.3 million to the carrying amount of $82.5 million resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment, resulting in a net carrying amount of $125.8 million as of January 2, 2022. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $125.8 million in fiscal 2022.

44

Share Repurchase Programs

Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. We used cash of $293.7 million in 2022, $1.32 billion in 2021 and $304.6 million in 2020 for share repurchases.

On October 4, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. On February 24, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock, which was fully utilized in connection with the ASR Agreement, described below. On April 30, 2021, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a counterparty (the “ASR Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization to pay the counterparty $1.0 billion in cash and received and retired 2,012,596 shares of our common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, we received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of our common stock at an average price of $444.29, including the 2,012,596 shares of our common stock received and retired during the second quarter of 2021.

On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This repurchase program replaced our previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was fully utilized in connection with the ASR Agreement. We had $410.4 million remaining under this share repurchase authorization as of January 1, 2023.

Dividends

We declared dividends of $157.5 million (or $4.40 per share) in 2022, $139.6 million (or $3.76 per share) in 2021 and $122.2 million (or $3.12 per share) in 2020. We paid dividends of $157.5 million, $139.4 million and $121.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

On February 21, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.21 per common share payable on March 30, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2023.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ------ - --------------- - ------ -
 Fiscal Year Ended
(In millions) January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022
Cash flows provided by (used in)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 475.3 $ 654.2
Net cash used in investing activities (53.7 ) (142.7 )
Net cash used in financing activities (515.9 ) (522.8 )
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1.0 ) (0.3 )
Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (95.3 ) $ (11.7 )

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities decreased $178.9 million in 2022 primarily due to the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $80.8 million. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities and higher cash paid for income taxes in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease was also a result of a $62.7 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing contributions. Additionally, net income decreased $58.2 million. However, this decrease in net income was partially offset by a $22.8 million increase in non-cash adjustments, resulting in an overall decrease to cash provided by operating activities in 2022 as compared to 2021 of $35.4 million.

We are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future.

45

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities was $53.7 million in 2022 which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $87.2 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and Company-owned store operations). In connection with the 2022 Store Sale, we refranchised 114 U.S. Company-owned stores for $41.1 million. Additionally, in connection with the 2022 Store Purchase, we acquired 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our U.S. franchisees for $6.8 million.

Cash used in investing activities was $142.7 million in 2021 which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $94.2 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and Company-owned stores) and our investments in DPC Dash of $49.1 million.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $515.9 million in 2022. We repurchased and retired $293.7 million in shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program and we also made dividend payments to our shareholders of $157.5 million. We borrowed and repaid $120.0 million under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes and also made $55.7 million in repayments on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations. We made $10.7 million of tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting and we also paid $1.6 million in financing costs associated with the issuance of our 2022 Variable Funding Notes. We also received proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2022 of $3.3 million.

Cash used in financing activities was $522.8 million in 2021. We completed the 2021 Recapitalization and issued $1.9 billion under the 2021 Notes. We made $910.2 million of payments on our long-term debt (of which $291.0 million related to the repayment of outstanding principal under our 2017 Floating Rate Notes and $582.0 million related the repayment of outstanding principal under our 2017 Five-Year Notes in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization). We also repurchased and retired $1.32 billion in shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program (including $1.0 billion under the ASR Agreement). We also made dividend payments to our shareholders of $139.4 million, paid $14.9 million in financing cost associated with our 2021 Recapitalization and made tax payments of $6.8 million for restricted stock upon vesting. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $19.7 million.

Impact of Inflation

Given the inflation rates in fiscal 2022, there have been and may continue to be increases in food costs and labor costs which have and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new U.S. and international franchised stores and adversely affect our operating results. Factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases. The impact of inflation is described with respect to our market basket pricing to stores and our labor cost, in the discussion of supply chain revenues and gross margin, above. Severe increases in inflation could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above, as well as in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...
