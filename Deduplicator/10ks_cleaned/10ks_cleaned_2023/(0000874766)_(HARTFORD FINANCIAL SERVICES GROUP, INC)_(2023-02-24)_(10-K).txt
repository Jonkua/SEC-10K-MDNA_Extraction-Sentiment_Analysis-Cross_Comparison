Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in 2022 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by an increase in P&C loss and loss adjustment expenses paid, higher operating expenses, including increased commissions and staffing costs, a decrease in Hartford Funds fee income and higher taxes paid, mostly offset by an increase in P&C and Group Benefits premiums received and lower integration and restructuring costs.
Cash used for investing activities decreased in 2022 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by a decrease in net payments for equity securities, a decrease in net payments for mortgage loans, a decrease in net payments for short term investments and a change from net payments to net proceeds from derivatives.
Cash used for financing activities increased primarily due to the redemption of $600 of 7.875% junior subordinated debentures in the second quarter of 2022, as well as proceeds from the issuance of debt in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases.
Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

|EQUITY MARKETS
For a discussion of the potential impact of the equity markets on capital and liquidity, see the Financial Risk on Statutory Capital and Liquidity Risk section in this MD&A.

|RATINGS
Ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the Company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings are downgraded, the Company’s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted.

On August 15, 2022, S&P upgraded the financial strength rating of The Navigators Group, Inc. and its core operating subsidiaries (collectively, "Navigators"), including NIC, to A+ from A with a Stable outlook. The upgrade of Navigators is reflective of its core status to the Company and recognizes its improved underwriting, which is in line with the Company's overall underwriting standard.
Insurance Financial Strength Ratings as of February 23, 2023

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the rating organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. The system and the number of rating categories can vary across rating agencies.
Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company's financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their capital formulas that have the effect of increasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.”

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Stat to GAAP Differences
Significant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholders’ equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:
•U.S. STAT excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
•Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT.
•Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while these amounts are then subject to further admissibility tests under U.S. STAT.
•The assumptions used in the determination of Group Benefits reserves (i.e. for Group Benefits contracts) are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company’s best estimates.
•The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while, under U.S. STAT, most investments are carried at amortized cost with only certain securities carried at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by

the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
•U.S. STAT for life insurance companies like HLA establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.
•Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.
•The deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance for losses ceded to the Navigators and A&E ADC agreements is recognized within a special category of surplus under U.S. STAT but is recognized within other liabilities under U.S. GAAP.
In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.

|RISK BASED CAPITAL

The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's U.S. operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.

Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

|SENSITIVITY

In any particular period, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.
Statutory capital at the insurance subsidiaries has been maintained at capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired RBC ratios and ratings from rating agencies. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting insurance results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred,

the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Inflation Reduction Act
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) which is generally effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. Notably, the bill created a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on corporations with three-year average financial statement income over $1 billion. The Internal Revenue Service has issued limited preliminary guidance. The Company has made certain interpretations and assumptions to comply with the CAMT. While the Company's financial statement income is over $1 billion, it is not expected the Company would have a CAMT liability. If CAMT is paid in the future, the amount would be indefinitely available as a credit carryforward that would reduce tax in future years and would be treated as a temporary item reflected within deferred taxes. The IRA also creates a 1% non-deductible excise tax on stock buybacks of publicly traded U.S. corporations. Such excise tax applies if a company repurchases in excess of $1 worth of its stock in any given calendar year. The impact of this provision will depend on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. In addition, the IRA added

an $80 billion funding increase for the IRS to support tax enforcement and modernization. Increases to IRS enforcement resources could increase audits on corporate taxpayers, which may include the Company. Finally, the IRA provides the U.S. Department of Treasury with authority to promulgate additional regulations and guidance on implementing the new law.
In addition, Congress may consider a variety of proposals including a possible increase in the corporate tax rate to offset the cost of any new spending. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives that may be considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any such Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.

Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2022.
MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
ATTESTATION REPORT OF THE COMPANY'S REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Certain of the information called for by Item 12 will be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the caption “Information on Stock Ownership” and is incorporated herein by reference.
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION
The following table provides information as of December 31, 2022 about the securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans, which consist of The Hartford 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2010 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2014 Stock Plan"), the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2020 Stock Plan") (collectively the "Stock Plans") and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).

On May 20, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which superseded the earlier plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2020 Stock Plan, no additional shares may be issued from the 2014 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under the 2010 Stock Plan and the 2014 Stock Plan are forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expire unexercised or are settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number of shares subject to the award, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the 2020 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2020 Stock Plan. For a description of the 2020 Stock Plan and the ESPP, see Note 19 - Stock Compensation Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors.
Given the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2022, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company's estimation processes.
•We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s analysis, including historical claims.
•With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by:

–Assessing the reasonableness of the Company’s analysis and, for selected reserving lines, developing independent estimates of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and comparing such estimates to the Company’s estimates.
–Comparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development of ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.
Investments in Fixed Maturities Classified as Available-for-Sale - Refer to Notes 1, 4, and 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the financial statements. The investments without readily determinable fair values were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as credit spreads and interest rates beyond the observable curve, that involved considerable judgment by the Company.
Given the Company used models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company’s estimation processes.
•On a sample basis, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the investments owned as of December 31, 2022, and the relevant security attributes used in the determination of their fair values.
•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for a sample of investments, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculation and developed independent estimates of the fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates. In addition to developing independent estimates, we obtained an understanding of the models and inputs used by the Company and assessed those models and inputs for reasonableness. Such assessment included comparing inputs to external sources or developing independent inputs.

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty ("P&C") insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ("ETF") to individual and business customers in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom and other international locations (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).
On December 29, 2021, the Company completed the sale of all of Navigators Holdings (Europe) N.V., a Belgium holding company, and its subsidiaries, Bracht, Deckers & Mackelbert N.V. and Assurances Contintales Contintale Verzekeringen N.V., collectively referred to as "Continental Europe Operations". For further discussion of this transaction, see Note 21 - Business Dispositions.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. Intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") updated guidance for recognition and measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for recognizing credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value. Under the new model, for financial instruments carried at other than fair value, such as mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and receivables, an allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is recognized, which is an estimate of credit losses expected over the life of financial instruments. Under the prior accounting model an ACL was recognized using an incurred loss approach. The new guidance also requires that we estimate a liability for credit losses ("LCL") on off balance sheet credit exposures, such as financial guarantees and mortgage loan commitments that the Company cannot unconditionally cancel.
Credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS carried at fair value continue to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows compared to amortized cost; however, the losses are now recognized through an ACL and no longer as an adjustment to the amortized cost. Recoveries of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS are now recognized as reversals of the ACL and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The ACL on fixed maturities, AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of the ACL and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase.
The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $18, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after tax. No ACL was recognized at adoption for fixed maturities, AFS; rather, these investments are evaluated for an ACL prospectively. The Company does not have any purchased financial assets with a more than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance.

Net increase to ACL and LCL $ (23)

Net decrease to retained earnings $ (18)

Reference Rate Reform
On March 12, 2020, the Company adopted the FASB’s temporary guidance, which allows The Hartford to account for contract modifications made solely due to rate reform (such as replacing London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with another reference rate) as continuations of existing contracts and to maintain hedge accounting when the hedging effectiveness between a financial instrument and its hedge is only affected by the change to a replacement rate. As a result, The Hartford will not recognize gains and losses during the transition period of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate that would otherwise have arisen from accounting assessments and remeasurements. On December 21, 2022, the FASB extended the effective date for the temporary guidance and the temporary guidance now expires for contract modifications made and hedge relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024. The Company is not required to measure the effect of adoption on its financial position, cash flows or net income

because the guidance provides relief from accounting for the effects of the change to a replacement rate.
Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Reserve for Future Policy Benefits
The FASB issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective January 1, 2023, and will be applied retrospectively to January 1, 2021 (the “transition date”). The Company’s long-duration insurance contracts include paid-up life insurance and whole-life insurance policies resulting from conversion from group life policies and run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities with total future policy benefit reserves of $561, $596 and $638 as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under guidance in effect up until the adoption date, a reserve for future policy benefits is calculated as the present value of future benefits and related expenses less the present value of any future premiums using assumptions “locked in” at the time the policies were issued, including discount rate, lapse rate, mortality, and expense assumptions. Under that guidance, assumptions are only updated if there is an expected premium deficiency. The new guidance will require that underlying cash flow assumptions (such as for lapse rate and mortality) be reviewed and updated at least annually in the same quarter each year. The new guidance also requires that the discount rate assumption be updated each quarter and be based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yield. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating cash flow assumptions will be recognized in net income. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating the discount rate assumption will be recognized in OCI. Because reserves will be based on updated assumptions and no longer locked in at contract inception, there will no longer be a test for premium deficiency. The Company will adopt the new guidance retrospectively to the transition date and will apply a modified retrospective transition method.
The Company expects the adoption of the new guidance to result in an increase of approximately $85 to the reserve for future policy benefits and a decrease of approximately $65 after tax to accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") as of the transition date because market upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yields were lower as of the transition date than the locked in rates that were previously used to discount the reserves. An increase in market interest rates since the transition date resulted in a change from an AOCI loss of approximately $65 to an AOCI gain of approximately $35 as of December 31, 2022.
Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Premium Revenue from Direct Insurance and Assumed Reinsurance
Property and casualty premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us, as well as ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and

retrospectively rated policies. We estimate the amount of premium not yet reported based on current and historical trends of the business being written. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year's results. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force, or period of risk.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
An estimated ACL is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds and considering historical credit loss information, adjusted for current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company records total credit loss expenses related to premiums receivable in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Write-offs of premiums receivable and agents' balances and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 7 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances for further discussion regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances.
Non-Insurance Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Installment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.
Insurance servicing revenues within Personal Lines consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized in other revenues over the period of the flood program's policy terms.
Group Benefits earns fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.
Hartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected monthly. Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Corporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets, including management of a portion of the invested assets of The Hartford’s former life and annuity business. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in

which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Dividends to Policyholders
Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.
Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 7% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $29, $24 and $29 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.
Investments
Overview
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, and redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. These investments represent certain investments in residual interests of securitizations and other securities that contain embedded credit derivatives. Equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of an ACL. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of equity fund investments, overseas deposits which are measured at fair value using the net asset value as a practical expedient, consolidated investment funds for which the Company has provided seed money and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies, and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.

Net Realized Gains and Losses
Net realized gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized gains and losses also result from fair value changes in equity securities, fixed maturities, FVO, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes. The Company records net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and changes in the ACL on mortgage loans as a component of net realized gains and losses. Future changes in the ACL resulting from improvements in expected future cash flows are recorded through net realized gains and losses. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above.
Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on the estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method. For certain other asset-backed securities, including securities that previously had an ACL and interest only securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For fixed maturities with an ACL, net investment income is recognized at the original effective rate and accretion of the ACL is recognized through net realized gains and losses. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Derivative Instruments
Overview
The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to engage in income generation covered call transactions and replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve the following Company-approved objectives:
•to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility;
•to manage liquidity;
•to control transaction costs;
•to enter into income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions.
Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals,

calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance regulators.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or

------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company may purchase investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Cash and Restricted Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e., risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as deposit transactions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's deposit liability was $0 and $99, respectively, reported in other liabilities.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurers for ceded paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its reinsurance recoverable assets and establishes an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The Company records credit losses related to reinsurance recoverables in benefits losses and loss adjustment expenses. Write-offs of reinsurance recoverables and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the estimate of the ACL.
Retroactive reinsurance agreements, including adverse development covers ("ADC"), are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of

loss development related to past insurable events. For these agreements, the consideration paid in excess of the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered under the agreement at inception is recognized as a loss on reinsurance transaction. The benefit of subsequent adverse development ceded up to the total consideration paid is recognized as ceded losses, which are a reduction of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. The excess of the estimated amounts ultimately to be recovered under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the period the ceded losses are recovered in cash from the reinsurer. The amount of the deferred gain liability is recalculated each period based on cumulative recoveries not yet collected relative to the latest estimate of ultimate losses to be recovered. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, and the deferred gain liability reported in other liabilities was $803 and $574, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In any given period, the change in deferred gain included in net income includes amortization of the deferred gain based on the percentage of ultimate ceded losses collected plus any change in the deferred gain liability due to changes in the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered. The effect on income from change in the deferred gain was a charge to earnings of $229, $246 and $312 before tax for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
DAC represents costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts, including a portion of policy issuance and underwriting costs.
For property and casualty insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.
The Hartford includes contingent deferred sales charge commissions paid to external broker-dealers on sales of shares of mutual funds in DAC, and amortizes the deferred costs over a 12 to 18 month period depending on the share class, or until the underlying shares are redeemed. Recoverability is reviewed as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and adjust them accordingly.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of temporary differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated

131

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill is impaired up to the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Group Benefits, and Hartford Funds.
Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections, the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.
Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment, which includes capitalized software and right-of-use lease assets, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is recognized principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $2.3 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation expense was $213, $282, and $271 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses. The

costs to access and develop hosted software arrangements, where The Hartford has the right to access and use the software, but not take possession, and the cost of certain software licenses are reported in other assets on a straight-line basis over the service period. Amortization of hosted software and certain software licenses was $78, $60, and $42 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses.
Leases
Leases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease is not economically similar to a purchase as the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the balance sheet.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
For property and casualty and group life, disability and accident insurance and assumed reinsurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. In addition, a number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reporting segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.
Group life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.
For further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

Treasury Stock
Treasury stock is the cost of common stock repurchased, which includes the purchase price of shares acquired and direct costs to acquire shares, including commissions and excise taxes. Issuance and retirement of treasury stock is recognized at the average cost of shares held in treasury.
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies; however, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 ("Lloyd's Syndicate"), the Lloyd's Syndicate for which the Company is the sole corporate member, in the U.K. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in net realized gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.

3. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company currently conducts business principally in five reporting segments including Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category.
Over 95% of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States (“U.S.”). The remaining revenues are generated in Europe and other international locations.
We report our results of operations consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. The Company’s reporting segments, as well as the Corporate category, are as follows:
Commercial Lines
Commercial Lines provides a variety of insurance products and risk management services in the U.S. and internationally, with insurance coverages including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, general liability, umbrella, package business, professional liability, bond, marine, livestock and assumed reinsurance.
Personal Lines
Personal Lines provides standard automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the U.S., including a special program designed exclusively for members of AARP. This agreement provides an important competitive advantage given the size of the 50 plus population and the strength of the AARP brand, and is in place through December 31, 2032.
Property & Casualty Other Operations

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:
Level 1    Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2    Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

Level 3    Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.
The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.

Valuation Techniques
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar

instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:
•Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.
•Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, such as municipal securities and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.
•Internal matrix pricing is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s sector, financial strength, and term to maturity, using an independent public security index, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.
•Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporates counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted

market prices for exchange-traded and OTC cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The process for determining the fair value of investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to provide oversight of the pricing policy, procedures and controls, including approval of valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The Valuation Committee reviews market data trends, pricing statistics and trading statistics to ensure that prices are reasonable and consistent with our fair value framework. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews. Controls include, but are not limited to, reviewing daily and monthly price changes, stale prices, and missing prices and comparing new trade prices to third-party pricing services, weekly price changes to published bond index prices, and daily OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations. The Company has a dedicated pricing group that works with trading and investment professionals to challenge prices received by a third party pricing source if the Company believes that the valuation received does not accurately reflect the fair value. New valuation models and changes to current models require approval by the Valuation Committee. In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded derivative instruments.

[6]Generally, a change in the assumption used for the constant default rate would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for constant prepayment rate and would have resulted in wider spreads.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of the Company's level 3 derivatives were less than $1 for both periods.
The table above excludes certain securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. As of December 31, 2022, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

Contingent Consideration
The acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice") on July 29, 2016 required the Company to make payments to former owners of Lattice of up to $60 contingent upon growth in ETF AUM over a period of four years beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration was measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETF AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout had been discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.0%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.
In January 2020, we made a third payment of $10 after Lattice AUM reached $3.0 billion. Given the dramatic market declines and outflows in March, 2020, Lattice AUM declined to $2.3 billion as of March 30, 2020 and the Company reduced the
remaining contingent consideration liability to zero, recognizing an $11.9 before tax reduction in expense in first quarter 2020.

The earn out period ended on July 29, 2020 with no additional consideration payable.
For disclosure of contingent consideration related to the sale of Continental Europe Operations, refer to Note 21 - Business Dispositions.

Fair Value Option

The Company has elected the fair value option for certain investments in residual interests of securitizations and other securities that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk related to residential real estate in order to reflect changes in fair value in earnings. These instruments are included within fixed maturities, FVO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of these investments are reported in net realized gains and losses.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of assets using the fair value option was $333 and $160, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, realized losses related to the change in fair value of assets using the fair value option were $28 and $6, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no realized gains (losses) related to the change in fair value of assets using the fair value option.

Also includes a loss of $21 and $48, respectively, on the sale of the Continental Europe Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as a gain of $46 for the year ended December 31, 2021 on the sale of the Company's previously owned interest in Talcott Resolution.

Proceeds from the sales of fixed maturities, AFS totaled $11.4 billion, $15.9 billion, and $15.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Sales of AFS securities in 2022 were primarily a result of tactical changes to the portfolio driven by changing market conditions, in addition to duration and liquidity management.
Accrued Interest Receivable on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Mortgage Loans
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company reported accrued interest receivable related to fixed maturities, AFS of $338 and $299, respectively, and accrued interest receivable related to mortgage loans of $18 and $16, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not included in the carrying value of the fixed maturities or mortgage loans. The Company does not include the current accrued interest receivable balance when estimating the ACL. The Company has a policy to write-off accrued interest receivable balances that are more than 90 days past due. Write-offs of accrued interest receivable are recorded as a credit loss component of net realized gains and losses.
Interest income on fixed maturities and mortgage loans is accrued unless it is past due over 90 days or management deems the interest uncollectible.
Recognition and Presentation of Intent-to-Sell Impairments and ACL on Fixed Maturities, AFS
The Company will record an "intent-to-sell impairment" as a reduction to the amortized cost of fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the

fixed maturity before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized losses equal to the difference between the fair value on the impairment date and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity before recognizing the impairment.
For fixed maturities where a credit loss has been identified and no intent-to-sell impairment has been recorded, the Company will record an ACL for the portion of the unrealized loss related to the credit loss. Any remaining unrealized loss on a fixed maturity after recording an ACL is the non-credit amount and is recorded in OCI. The ACL is the excess of the amortized cost over the greater of the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows or the security's fair value. Cash flows are discounted at the effective yield that is used to record interest income. The ACL cannot exceed the unrealized loss and, therefore, it may fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity if the fair value is greater than the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows. The initial ACL and any subsequent changes are recorded in net realized gains and losses. The ACL is written off against the amortized cost in the period in which all or a portion of the related fixed maturity is determined to be uncollectible.
Developing the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and/or the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.

For non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, instrument-specific developments including changes in credit ratings, industry earnings multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure, access capital markets, and execute asset sales.
For structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and

projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios, average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.

Estimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. Due to the potential for variability in payment speeds (i.e., prepayments or extensions), mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are not categorized by contractual maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk. The Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021, other than U.S. government securities and certain U.S. government agencies.
As of December 31, 2022, other than U.S. government securities and certain U.S. government agencies, the

Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were the Toronto Dominion Bank, Morgan Stanley, and the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group each of which comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2021, other than U.S. government securities and certain U.S. government agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were the Government of Canada, Apple Inc., and the IBM Corporation each of which comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2022, were the municipal sector, the financial services sector, and the RMBS sector which comprised approximately 12%, 9%, and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2021, were the municipal sector, the financial services sector, and CMBS sector which comprised approximately 14%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets.

As of December 31, 2022, fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position consisted of 4,936 instruments and were primarily depressed due to higher interest rates and/or wider credit spreads since the purchase date. As of December 31, 2022, 91% of these fixed maturities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The increase in unrealized losses during 2022, was primarily attributable to higher interest rates and wider credit spreads.
Most of the fixed maturities depressed for twelve months or more relate to the corporate sector and RMBS which were primarily depressed because current rates are higher and/or market spreads are wider than at the respective purchase dates. Additionally, certain corporate fixed maturities were also depressed because of their variable-rate coupons and long-dated maturities. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the fixed maturities outlined in the preceding discussion. The decision to record credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS in the form of an ACL requires us to make qualitative and quantitative estimates of expected future cash flows.
Mortgage Loans
ACL on Mortgage Loans
The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to estimate the ACL with changes in the ACL recorded in net realized gains and losses. Apart from an ACL recorded on individual mortgage loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company records an ACL on the pool of mortgage loans based on lifetime expected credit losses. The Company utilizes a third-party forecasting model to estimate lifetime expected credit losses at a loan level under multiple economic scenarios. The scenarios use macroeconomic data provided by an internationally recognized economics firm that generates forecasts of varying economic factors such as GDP growth, unemployment and interest rates. The economic scenarios are projected over 10 years. The first two to four years of the 10-year period assume a specific modeled economic scenario (including moderate upside, moderate recession and severe recession scenarios) and then revert to historical long-term assumptions over the remaining period. Using these economic scenarios, the forecasting model projects property-specific operating income and capitalization rates used to estimate the value of a future operating income stream. The operating income and the property valuations derived from capitalization rates are compared to loan payment and principal

amounts to create debt service coverage ratios ("DSCRs") and LTVs over the forecast period. The Company's process also considers qualitative factors. The model overlays historical data about mortgage loan performance based on DSCRs and LTVs and projects the probability of default, amount of loss given a default and resulting expected loss through maturity for each loan under each economic scenario. Economic scenarios are probability-weighted based on a statistical analysis of the forecasted economic factors and qualitative analysis. The Company records the change in the ACL on mortgage loans based on the weighted-average expected credit losses across the selected economic scenarios.
When a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is probable, the Company measures an ACL on individual mortgage loans. The ACL is established for any shortfall between the amortized cost of the loan and the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Estimates of collectibility from an individual borrower require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of borrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any mortgage loans for which an ACL was established on an individual basis.
There were no mortgage loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract.

[1]Represents the adjustment to the ACL recorded on adoption of accounting guidance for credit losses on January 1, 2020. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.
The increase in the allowance for the 2022 period was primarily attributable to the deteriorating economic conditions and the potential impact on real estate property valuations and, to a lesser extent, net additions of new loans. During 2021, the Company decreased the estimate of the ACL in response improved economic scenarios, including improved GDP growth and unemployment, and higher property valuations. During 2020, the Company increased the estimate of the ACL in response to significant economic stress experienced as a result

of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was 52% as of December 31, 2022, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was 59%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan with property values based on appraisals updated no less than annually. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments and are updated no less than annually through reviews of underlying properties.

Past-Due Mortgage Loans
Mortgage loans are considered past due if a payment of principal or interest is not received according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, which typically includes a grace period. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company held no mortgage loans considered past due.
Mortgage Servicing
The Company originates, sells, and services commercial mortgage loans on behalf of third parties and recognizes servicing fee income over the period that services are performed. As of December 31, 2022, under this program, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal of $9.3 billion, of which $4.4 billion was serviced on

behalf of third parties and $4.9 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $8.2 billion, of which $3.9 billion was serviced on behalf of third parties and $4.3 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were $0 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager.
A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidated VIEs
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is limited to the total carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, which are a portion of the investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets that are primarily recorded using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLO, CMBS, and RMBS and are reported in fixed maturities, AFS, and fixed maturities, FVO, on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs, and, where applicable, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.
Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Other Collateral Transactions and Restricted Investments
Reverse Repurchase Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The maturity of these transactions is generally within one year. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company under specified conditions and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company reported $41 and $30, respectively, within short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets representing a receivable for the amount of cash transferred to purchase the securities.
Other Collateral Transactions
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company pledged collateral of $7 and $9, respectively, of U.S. government securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement.
For disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Restricted Investments
The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is required to hold fixed maturities and short-term investments in trust for the benefit of syndicate policyholders, hold fixed maturities in a Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's") trust account to provide a portion of the required capital, and maintain other investments primarily consisting of overseas deposits in various countries with Lloyd's to support underwriting activities in those countries. Lloyd's is an insurance market-place operating worldwide. Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. The Company accepts risks as the sole

member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 ("Lloyd's Syndicate").
The following table presents the components of the Company’s exposure to other restricted investments.

Equity Method Investments
The majority of the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, including hedge funds, real estate joint ventures and funds, and private equity funds (collectively, “limited partnerships”), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. Prior to June 30, 2021, the Company also had a retained 9.7% investment in Hopmeadow Holdings LP, the legal entity that acquired Talcott Resolution in May 2018 (collectively referred to as "Talcott Resolution"), which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and was reported in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. On June 30, 2021, the Company sold its 9.7% ownership interest in Talcott Resolution and received a total $217 in connection with the sale, resulting in a realized gain on sale of $46 before tax during 2021.
The Company recognized total equity method income of $533, $630, and $244 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity method income is reported in net investment income, except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets which are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2022 is limited to the total carrying value of $3.7 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $2.1 billion to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management.
In 2022, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded 10% of the Company’s before tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated, summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method based on the most recently available information. This aggregated, summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of investees' assets or earnings. Aggregate total assets of the investees totaled $289.9 billion and $249.8 billion as of

December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of the investees totaled $46.8 billion and $41.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Aggregate net investment income of the investees totaled $1.6 billion, $2.1 billion, and $954 for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Aggregate net income

excluding net investment income of the investees totaled $11.9 billion, $46.7 billion and $7.4 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of, and for the period ended, December 31, 2022, the aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information.

6. DERIVATIVES

The Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions or income generation covered call transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies.
Strategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Some of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities or debt instruments issued.
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on variable-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month LIBOR + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedges of interest rate, foreign currency, equity, and commodity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities. In addition, hedging and replication

strategies that utilize credit default swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:
Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty or the Company should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. The Company also enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars.
Equity Index Options
The Company may enter into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company has also previously entered into covered call options on equity securities to generate additional return.
Commodity Options
During the first quarter of 2022, the Company paid $10 to purchase call option contracts on oil futures in order to partially offset potential changes in value related to certain fixed maturity securities that could arise if oil prices increased substantially. The option contracts were either terminated or were closed by entering into offsetting positions during the first quarter of 2022, resulting in a realized gain of $14.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification
For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income

accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

Offsetting of Derivative Assets/Liabilities
The following tables present the gross fair value amounts, the amounts offset, and net position of derivative instruments eligible for offset in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Offsetting amounts include fair value amounts, income accruals and related cash collateral receivables and payables associated with derivative instruments that are traded under a common master netting agreement, as described in the preceding discussion. Also included in the tables are financial collateral receivables and payables, which are contractually permitted to be offset upon an event of default, although are disallowed for offsetting under U.S. GAAP.

As of December 31, 2022, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $3. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities and long-term debt that will occur over the next twelve months. Over that time, the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an

adjustment to net investment income or interest expense, as applicable, over the term of the hedged instrument cash flows.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives
The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be

equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of CMBS issuers.

Derivative Collateral Arrangements

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements in connection with its derivative instruments, which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has pledged cash collateral associated with derivative instruments of less than $1 and $2, respectively. In general, collateral receivable is recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company pledged securities collateral associated with derivative instruments with a fair value of $8 and $48, respectively, which have been included in fixed maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The counterparties have the right to sell or re-pledge these securities.
In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has pledged initial margin of cash related to OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivatives with a fair value of $16 and $12, respectively, which is recorded in other investments or other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has pledged initial margin of securities related to OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivatives with a fair value of $57 and $82, respectively, which are included within fixed maturities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Total Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances, Net of ACL $ 4,949 $ 4,445

ACL on Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances
Premiums receivable and agents' balances, excluding receivables for loss sensitive business, are primarily comprised of premiums due from policyholders, which are typically collectible within one year or less. For these balances, the ACL is estimated based on an aging of receivables and recent historical credit loss and collection experience, adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when appropriate. Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods.
A portion of the Company's Commercial Lines business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans (referred to as "loss sensitive business"). Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the

policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement is made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight.
The ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business is estimated as the amount of the receivable exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each policyholder's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed and updated at least annually. The exposure amount is estimated net of collateral and other credit enhancement, considering the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical loss information for the type of collateral obtained. The probability of default factors are historical corporate defaults for receivables with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors through multiple economic cycles. The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for receivables for loss sensitive business considers the current economic environment as well as the probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used for estimating the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 5 - Investments.
The increase in ACL in 2022 reflected the provision required on premiums written in the year and recoveries, offset by write-offs. During 2021, the ACL on premiums receivable decreased as the provision required on premiums written during the year was more than offset by write-offs and a reduction in the provision, primarily reflecting lessening expected impacts of COVID-19 relative to prior assumptions in certain lines of business. In 2020, an increase in the ACL was due to the increasing impacts of COVID-19.

The adjusted beginning ACL was based on the Company's historical loss information adjusted for current conditions and the forecasted economic environment at the time the guidance was adopted.

8. REINSURANCE

The Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.
The Company has two adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all asbestos and environmental ("A&E") reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years ("A&E ADC") up to an aggregate limit of $1.5 billion and the other covered substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the Navigators ADC) up to an aggregate limit of $300. As the Company has ceded all of the $300 available limit, there is no remaining limit available as of December 31, 2022 under the Navigators ADC. For more information on ADC agreements, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.
Property and Casualty ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $1,338, $1,243 and

$1,156 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Group Benefits ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $81, $85 and $63 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods, generally 30, 60 or 90 days. To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.
Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers.
Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL is estimated as the amount of reinsurance recoverables exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each reinsurer's credit rating, or a rating is estimated if no external rating is available. Credit ratings are reviewed on a quarterly basis and any significant changes are reflected in an updated estimate. The probability of default factors are historical insurer and reinsurer defaults for liabilities

with similar durations to the reinsured liabilities as estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The loss given default factors are based on a study of historical recovery rates for general creditors of corporations through multiple economic cycles or, in the case of purchased annuities funding structured settlements accounted for as reinsurance, historical recovery rates for annuity contract holders.
As shown in the table above, a portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverable balance relates to the Company’s participation in various mandatory (assigned) and voluntary risk pools. Reinsurance recoverables due from pools are backed by the financial position of all insurance companies participating in the pools and the credit backing the reinsurance recoverable is not limited to the financial strength of each pool. The mandatory pools generally are funded through policy assessments or surcharges and if any participant in the pool defaults, remaining liabilities are apportioned among the other members.
The Company's evaluation of the required ACL for reinsurance recoverables considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 5 - Investments. Insurance companies, including reinsurers, are regulated and hold risk-based capital to mitigate the risk of loss due to economic factors and other risks. Non-U.S. reinsurers are either subject to a capital regime substantively equivalent to domestic insurers or we hold collateral to support collection of reinsurance recoverables. As a result, there is limited history of losses from insurer defaults. There were $0 and $1 in write-offs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that would impact the ACL. The decrease in the ACL in 2021 was primarily due to a higher than expected recovery from one reinsurer on which the Company had recognized an ACL. In 2020, the increase in the ACL includes the increasing impacts of COVID-19.

Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 0.83% for accident year 2020 to 14.03% for accident year 1981.
The reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2022 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures before reinsurance, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

severity and, to a lesser extent, a $14 reduction of COVID-19 related claims from 2020.
General liability reserves were increased, driven by an increase in the estimated cost to settle large individual claims in middle and large commercial for the 2016 to 2019 accident years, an increase in excess casualty and environmental in recent accident years, and increases in primary construction on older accident years, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for other mass torts.
Package business reserves decreased due to lower estimated severity and lower estimated loss adjustment expenses for accident years 2018 and prior, and a reduction in property reserves for the 2020 and 2021 accident years.
Commercial property reserves were decreased primarily due to favorable development for the 2020 accident year in middle & large commercial related to COVID-19 claims.
Professional liability reserves were decreased primarily due to favorable development on directors’ and officers’ claims for the 2018 to 2020 accident years and on errors and omissions claims for the 2013 to 2017 accident years, partially offset by large losses related to 2018 and prior accident years for primary and excess directors’ and officers’ claims.
Bond reserves were decreased primarily in contract surety due to favorable development on older accident years.
Assumed reinsurance reserves were increased primarily due to higher reserve estimates for syndicate property claims, including higher expected COVID-19 property losses in the 2020 accident year and increased reserves for international agriculture related to drought claims. Also contributing were reserve increases for Latin America P&C and specialty casualty business in recent accident years.
Automobile liability reserves were decreased in Personal Lines principally due to lower estimated severity on AARP Direct claims, primarily within accident years 2015 to 2020 and were increased in Commercial Lines principally due to a higher number of large claims in accident years 2017 to 2019, along with decreasing settlement rates and increasing attorney rep rates.
Catastrophe reserves were decreased in both Commercial and Personal Lines with the largest reduction related to 2019 and 2020 wind and hail events.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were reviewed in fourth quarter 2022 resulting in a $229 increase in reserves before ADC reinsurance, including $162 for asbestos and $67 for environmental. The Company recognized a $229 deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, representing the amount of losses ceded to the ADC in excess of ceded premium paid. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see the Adverse Development Covers section below and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, were increased primarily due to an increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense ("ULAE") reserves within P&C Other Operations driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves, as well as unfavorable development from participation in involuntary market pools, and increased automobile physical damage severity.

2021 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
Workers’ compensation reserves were decreased within small commercial and middle & large commercial for the 2013 through 2018 accident years driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity.
General liability reserves were increased including an increase for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims above the amount of reserves previously recorded for this exposure, primarily to reflect an increase in reserves for claims made against the Boy Scouts of America ("BSA") as discussed further below, partially offset by reserve decreases for other mass torts and extra contractual liability claims. In addition, the Company recognized reserve increases on Navigators’ wholesale construction business for 2018 and prior accident years, largely included within the change in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance in the above table.
Package business reserves decreased largely due to lower estimated loss adjustment expenses for accident years 2014 to 2018 and a reduction in estimated reserves for extra contractual liability claims.
Commercial property reserves were decreased primarily due to favorable development for the 2020 accident year in both middle & large commercial and global specialty.
Professional liability reserves were decreased due to lower estimated severity in both large and middle market directors’ and officers’ (“D&O”) insurance for older accident years. More than offsetting this favorable reserve development were reserve increases on legacy Navigators public company directors’ and officers’ insurance for 2019 and prior accident years, a portion of which is reflected within the change in deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance in the above table.
Bond reserves were reduced mostly due to favorable emergence on contract surety claims driven by higher than previously anticipated recoveries, largely for the 2016 to 2017 accident years.
Automobile liability reserves were decreased in Personal Lines principally due to lower estimated severity on AARP Direct and Agency claims, primarily within accident years 2017 to 2020, and a reduction in estimated reserves for extra contractual liability claims.
Catastrophes reserves were decreased in both Commercial and Personal Lines primarily driven by a reduction in reserves for 2018 and 2019 wind and hail events, lower estimated losses from 2018 and 2020 hurricanes, a reduction in estimated losses from the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires, including an expected recovery of subrogation from a utility related to the 2018 Woolsey wildfire in California, and a reduction in losses relating to the 2020 civil unrest.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were reviewed in fourth quarter 2021 resulting in a $155 increase in reserves before ADC reinsurance, including $106 for asbestos and $49 for environmental. The Company recognized a $155 deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, representing the amount of losses ceded to the ADC in excess of ceded premium

paid. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see the Adverse Development Covers section below and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, were increased primarily due to an increase in reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims within P&C Other Operations, principally on assumed reinsurance, as well as an increase in ULAE reserves within P&C Other Operations driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves.
2020 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced on national account business within middle & large commercial, driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity for the 2015 and prior accident years, including on captives business, and were reduced in small commercial due to lower than expected claim severity for the 2013 to 2018 accident years.
General liability reserves were increased primarily due to a $254 increase in reserves for sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims related to cases brought against religious and other organizations that were insureds of the Company, partly offset by a decrease in reserves for other mass torts and extra contractual liability claims. The sexual molestation and sexual abuse exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods, which can raise complex coverage issues with significant effects on the ultimate scope of coverage. This increase in reserves reflects an increase in claim incidence largely due to reviver statutes, which is legislation passed in a number of states that provides an opportunity for claimants to file claims for a period of time despite the fact that the original statute of limitations had expired. The reserve increase in 2020 was principally from claims asserted against the Boy Scouts of America (“Boy Scouts”).
In addition, general liability reserve increases on construction account business were largely offset by decreases in ULAE reserves. Reserves were increased for guaranteed cost construction business for accident years 2014 to 2019 as incurred losses are developing higher than previously expected for premises and operations claims and product liability claims, partly due to a change in industry mix and a heavier concentration of losses in California than initially assumed, as well as increased reserves for middle market and complex liability claims for accident year 2018 largely due to higher than expected severity. Also contributing were increases in reserves on primary layer construction account business within global specialty, mainly related to accident years 2015 to 2017, which is included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.
Marine reserves were increased principally due to an increase in domestic marine liability, mostly in accident years 2017 and 2018 due to a higher number of large losses. The increase in marine reserves is included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.

Package business reserves decreased for accident years 2014 to 2017 largely due to lower estimates of allocated loss adjustment expenses.
Commercial property reserves were decreased for accident year 2019 due to favorable developments on marine and middle market property claims.
Professional liability reserves were decreased primarily due to lower estimated severity on non-security class action D&O claims and fewer than expected E&O claims with financial institutions for the 2011 to 2018 accident years, partially offset by an increase in D&O reserves for the 2019 accident year driven by higher frequency of class action lawsuits and an increase in large Syndicate D&O losses for the 2016 and 2017 accident years. These Syndicate reserve increases within global specialty are included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.
Bond reserves were reduced within contract surety driven by both favorable loss development on the 2015 to 2017 accident years and higher than expected loss recoveries on older accident years
Assumed reinsurance reserves were increased for accident year 2018 mostly due to higher accident and health reserve estimates for medical professionals on assumed casualty business. These reserve increases are included as a component of the change in deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance in the above table.
Automobile liability reserves were decreased in Personal Lines principally due to lower than previously expected AARP Direct automobile liability claim severity for the 2017 to 2019 accident years. Automobile liability reserves were increased in Commercial Lines primarily due to higher than expected large losses within middle & large commercial, predominantly within the 2015 to 2019 accident years.
Catastrophes reserves were reduced, primarily due to a reduction in estimated reserves for 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and a reduction in estimated catastrophes for wind and hail events in the 2017 to 2019 accident years, partially offset by an increase in reserves for 2019 typhoons Hagibis and Faxai in Asia. The reduction in reserves for the 2017 and 2018 wildfires was largely due to recognizing a $289 subrogation benefit in the second quarter of 2020 from PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("PG&E") as well as a reduction in gross estimated losses on those wildfires.
In December, 2019, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy of PG&E approved an $11 billion settlement of insurance subrogation claims to resolve all such claims arising from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp wildfire. That settlement was contingent upon, among other things, the judge entering an order confirming PG&E’s chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (“PG&E Plan”) incorporating the settlement agreement. On June 20, 2020, the bankruptcy court judge approved the PG&E Plan and PG&E subsequently transferred the $11 billion settlement amount to a trust designed to allocate and distribute the settlement among subrogation holders, including certain of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an estimated $289 subrogation benefit though the ultimate amount it collects will depend on

how the Company’s ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation compare to other insurers’ ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves were reduced due to higher than expected recoveries from reinsurers in older accident years.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were reviewed in fourth quarter 2020 resulting in a $218 increase in reserves before ADC reinsurance, including $127 for asbestos and $91 for environmental. Of the $218 increase in A&E reserves, the Company ceded $220 to the A&E ADC resulting in a net reserve release of $2. Of the $220 of adverse development ceded to the A&E ADC, the Company recognized a $210 deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance, representing the amount of losses ceded to the ADC in excess of ceded premium paid. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see the Adverse Development Covers section below and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, primarily represents an increase in ULAE reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was largely driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves.
Settlement Agreement with Boy Scouts of America
On September 14, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a new agreement-in-principle with the BSA, related to sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims associated with liability policies issued by various Hartford writing companies in the 1970s and early 1980s, with the agreement in-principle including the BSA, its local councils and the representatives of a majority of the sexual abuse claimants. As part of the agreement-in-principle, The Hartford will pay $787, before tax, for claims associated with these policies. In exchange for The Hartford’s payment, the BSA and its local councils will fully release The Hartford from any obligation under policies The Hartford issued to the BSA and its local councils. In addition, the representatives for the claimants joining this agreement-in-principle will support a plan of reorganization which incorporates the settlement.
The agreement-in-principle was reached in connection with the BSA’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a written settlement agreement (the "Settlement") was executed on February 14, 2022. The Settlement will become final upon the occurrence of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, confirmation of the BSA’s plan of reorganization by both the bankruptcy and district courts, receipt of executed releases from the local councils, and approval of the Settlement as part of the confirmation of the BSA's plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy and district courts. On September 8, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the BSA's plan of reorganization, including the Settlement. The BSA's plan of reorganization is now before the civil district court for approval. Upon civil district court approval, the Company will pay the settlement amount of $787. However, no assurance can be given that all the conditions precedent to the Settlement will be satisfied or that final court approval, if obtained, will not be delayed for various procedural reasons.

If the conditions precedent to the Settlement are not satisfied or the requisite court approvals for the BSA’s plan of reorganization are not obtained, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated operating results.
Adverse Development Covers
The Company has an adverse development cover reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reinsure loss development after 2016 on substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental reserves (the “A&E ADC”). Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion including reserves for A&E exposure for accident years prior to 1986 that are reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations ("Run-off A&E") and reserves for A&E exposure for accident years 1986 and subsequent from policies underwritten prior to 2016 that are reported in ongoing Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid have been recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid result in a deferred gain. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred $1,244 in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO with $256 of available limit remaining under the A&E ADC. As a result, the Company has recorded a $594 deferred gain within other liabilities, representing the difference between the reinsurance recoverable of $1,244 and ceded premium paid of $650. The deferred gain is recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims will result in charges against earnings which may be significant.
Immediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased the Navigators ADC, an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development, from NICO on behalf of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Navigators Insurers"). Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $91 in exchange for reinsurance coverage of $300 of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $100 above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss

and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $1.816 billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded a reinsurance recoverable under the Navigators ADC of $300 as estimated cumulative loss development on the 2018 and prior accident year reserves has exhausted the treaty limit. While the

reinsurance recoverable is $300, the Company has recorded a $209 cumulative deferred gain within other liabilities since, under retroactive reinsurance accounting, ceded losses in excess of the $91 of ceded premium paid must be recognized as a deferred gain. Of the $209 of cumulative ceded losses in excess of ceded premium paid, $91 and $102 were recognized as changes in deferred gain in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

[1]Asbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, sexual molestation and sexual abuse and other long-tail liabilities. These reserve lines do not have significant paid or incurred loss development for the most recent ten accident years and therefore do not have loss development displayed in triangles.

The reserve lines in the above table and the loss triangles that follow represent the significant lines of business for which the Company regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels. These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The cumulative incurred losses displayed in the above table include the full reinsurance benefit of ceding $300 of losses to the Navigators ADC even though $209 of that benefit has been recorded as a deferred gain within other liabilities. The $300 of Navigators Insurers losses ceded to the Navigators ADC and reflected in the following triangles include $95 for professional liability,$105 for general liability, $38 for marine, $27 for assumed reinsurance, $14 for commercial automobile, $3 for commercial property, and $1 for bond. The triangles do not include $17of losses ceded to the Navigators ADC related to older accident years and lines of business not in the triangles.

The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year, including loss development on Navigators Insurers reserves prior to and after the May 23, 2019 acquisition date. Because the loss triangles include pre-acquisition date changes in ultimate incurred loss estimates for Navigators Insurers’ reserves, changes in reserve development evident in the incurred loss triangles may differ from prior accident year development recorded by the Company as shown in the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above as that only includes changes in Navigators Insurers’ reserves post acquisition. In addition, the incurred loss triangles include reserve development on both catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims whereas the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above shows the total amount of catastrophe reserve development across all lines of business on a single line.

Property and casualty reserves, including IBNR
The Company estimates ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year. IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.
Reserves for losses are set by line of business within the reporting segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of

business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
For both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio ("ELR") is used to record initial reserves. This ELR is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the ELR for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the ELR for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, including commercial property, homeowners, and automobile physical damage, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative in certain accident years due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.
As losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the ELR method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the ELR and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as actuarial indications.
Paid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the ELR method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for automobile liability. The Berquist-Sherman technique is also used for automobile liability, marine and assumed reinsurance. For most lines, reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE"), or those expenses related to specific claims) are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. For most of the lines acquired through the Navigators Group book of business, loss and ALAE are reviewed on a combined basis. Reserves for ULAE are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.
The recorded reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the Company's best estimate of the ultimate settlement amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. In applying judgment, the best estimate is selected after considering the estimates derived from a number of actuarial methods, giving more weight to those methods

deemed more predictive of ultimate unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Company does not produce a statistical range or confidence interval of reserve estimates and, since reserving methods with more credibility are given greater weight, the selected best estimate may differ from the mid-point of the various estimates produced by the actuarial methods used.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For most property and casualty lines, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event. For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts. For some property and casualty lines, such as marine and assumed reinsurance, a claim count represents each reported claim regardless of the number of features. For assumed bordereau business and business written on binders, one claim count is posted for each bordereau received, which could account for multiple claims.

2022 re-estimates of prior incurral year reserves
Group disability- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $325 largely driven by group long-term disability claim incidence lower than prior assumptions, strong recoveries on prior incurral year claims and higher estimated claim termination rates.
Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $50 largely driven by continued low incidence in group life premium waiver as well as a reduction in estimated excess mortality losses incurred in fourth quarter 2021.
Supplemental Accident & Health- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $6 driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence.
2021 re-estimates of prior incurral year reserves
Group disability- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $380 largely driven by group long-term disability claim incidence lower than prior assumptions together with strong recoveries on prior incurral year claims, and by a New York Paid Family Leave risk adjustment benefit.

Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $65 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence in both group life premium waiver and group accidental death and dismemberment.
Supplemental Accident & Health- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $10 driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence during the pandemic.

Group life, disability and accident reserves, including IBNR
The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for long-term disability ("LTD") claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability. In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.
For incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.

Table of Contents Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection. In these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.
The Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured is unable to work due to disability and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months (premium waiver reserves). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.

In addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental death & dismemberment, short term disability, and other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss. IBNR for these lines of business equals the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses less the amount of paid or reported claims depending on whether the paid or reported development method was used. Estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends or other factors that affect the development pattern.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For group life, disability and accident coverages, claim counts include claims that are approved, pending approval and terminated and exclude denied claims. Due to the nature of the claims, one claimant represents one event.

[1]In April 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the variable interest payments for this debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.
[2]This amount includes unamortized discount of $72 and $74 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on the 6.1% Notes, due 2041.
The effective interest rate on the 6.1% senior notes due 2041 is 7.9%. The effective interest rate on the remaining notes does not differ materially from the stated rate.
Shelf Registrations
On February 22, 2022, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-262879) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, guarantees, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.

Senior Notes
On September 21, 2021, The Hartford issued $600 of 2.9% senior notes (“2.9% Notes”) due September 15, 2051 for net proceeds of approximately $588, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses from the offering. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing March 15, 2022. The Hartford, at its option, can redeem the 2.9% Notes at any time, in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed or a make-whole amount based on a comparable maturity US Treasury plus 20 basis points, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, except the 2.9% Notes may be redeemed at par within six months of maturity.
On March 30, 2020, The Hartford repaid at maturity the $500 principal amount of its 5.5% senior notes.

[1]Payable quarterly in arrears.
[2]Debentures were issued on the original call date of February 15, 2017. The interest rate is variable and resets quarterly. In April 2017, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the interest payments for the 3 Month LIBOR + 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.
[3]Although the original call date was February 15, 2017, a Replacement Capital Covenant associated with the debenture prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022, unless consent from covered bondholders is obtained.
On April 15, 2022, The Hartford redeemed at par $600 aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% junior subordinated debentures due 2042 and recognized, in insurance operating costs and other expenses, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9, before tax, for unamortized debt issuance costs.
The 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.
The Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to a consecutive ten years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank

upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.
The Company may elect to redeem the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures in whole or in part on or after the call date for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
In connection with the offering of the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant ("RCC") for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities.
The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a representative basis would cease immediately after June 30, 2023. The Company continues to monitor the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR, which is used as a benchmark or reference rate for certain investments and derivatives the Company owns, and floating rate debt the Company has issued. Uncertainties and risks relating to the transition from LIBOR have been reduced by the federal Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, which addresses replacement of LIBOR in certain contracts governed by U.S. law (including the law of any U.S. state), including the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture.

Revolving Credit Facility
In 2018, The Hartford entered into a $750 senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), with an expiration date of March 29, 2023. On October 27, 2021, The Hartford amended and restated the Credit Facility (as amended, the “2021 Credit Facility”) which, among other changes, extends the term of the facility through October 27, 2026, includes provisions for determining LIBOR successor rates, and resets the level of The Hartford’s minimum consolidated net worth financial covenant to $11.25 billion, excluding AOCI. The 2021 Credit Facility provides up to $750 of unsecured credit, including $100 available to support letters of credit. Under the 2021 Credit Facility:
•Revolving loans may be in multiple currencies.
•U.S. dollar loans will bear interest at a floating rate equivalent to an indexed rate that varies depending on the type of borrowing plus a basis point spread based

on The Hartford's credit rating and will mature no later than October 27, 2026.
•Letters of credit bear a fee based on The Hartford's credit rating and expire no later than October 27, 2027.
The 2021 Credit Facility limits the ratio of senior debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, at 35% and includes other customary covenants. The 2021 Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding, no letters of credit were issued under the 2022 Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facilities
On November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the “Club Facility”). The Club Facility had two tranches with one tranche extending a $104 commitment and the other tranche extending a £85 million ($115 as of December 31, 2021) commitment. In addition, on November 5, 2020, The Hartford entered into a non-committed $25 credit facility with a lender (the “Bilateral Facility”). The term of both of these facilities was two years. The purpose of these facilities was to issue letters of credit that may be treated as Funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting capacity provided by the Navigators Corporate Underwriters Limited to the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1221 for the 2021 and 2022 underwriting years of account (and prior open years). As of December 31, 2021, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $104 and £68 million, or $92, were outstanding under the Club Facility and no letters of credit were outstanding under the Bilateral Facility.
On November 1, 2022, The Hartford amended and restated its Club Facility agreement. The Club Facility has two tranches, with one tranche extending a $74 commitment and the other tranche extending a £79 million ($95 as of December 31, 2022) commitment. The term of the facility is two years. The purpose of this facility is to issue letters of credit that may be treated as Funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting capacity provided by the Navigators Corporate Underwriters Limited to the Lloyd’s Syndicate 1221 for the 2023 and 2024 underwriting years of account (and prior open years). As of December 31, 2022, letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $74 and £79 million, or $95, were outstanding under the Club Facility. The Bilateral Facility agreement terminated on November 5, 2022.
Among other covenants, the Club Facility contains financial covenants regarding The Hartford’s consolidated net worth and financial leverage and that limit the amount of letters of credit that can support Funds at Lloyd’s, consistent with Lloyd’s requirements. As of December 31, 2022, The Hartford was in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility.
Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
The Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA"), are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ("FHLBB"). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. FHLBB

----------------- --------------------------------------------------------
 Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules
Table of Contents Note 13 - Debt

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

membership required the purchase of member stock and requires additional member stock ownership of 3% or 4% of any amount borrowed. Acceptable forms of collateral include real estate backed fixed maturities and mortgage loans and the amount of advances that can be taken is limited to a percentage of the fair value of the assets that ranges from a high of 97% for US government-backed fixed maturities maturing within 3 years to a low of 40% for A-rated commercial mortgage-backed fixed maturities maturing in 5 years or more. In its consolidated balance sheets, The Hartford presents the liability for advances taken based on use of the funds with advances for general corporate purposes presented in short- or long-term debt and

advances to earn incremental investment income presented in other liabilities, consistent with other collateralized financing transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements. The Connecticut Department of Insurance permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2023. The pledge limit is determined quarterly based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus of Hartford Fire and HLA, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, there were no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.
Litigation
The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties related to sexual molestation and sexual abuse claims discussed in Note 11, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, and in the following discussion under the caption “COVID-19 Pandemic Business Income Insurance Litigation” and under the caption “Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.
The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. In addition to the matter described below, these actions include putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper sales or underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, disability, and life. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless,

given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
COVID-19 Pandemic Business Income Insurance Litigation
Like many others in the property and casualty insurance industry, beginning in April 2020, various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company (collectively the "Hartford Writing Companies”), and in some instances the Company itself, have been served as defendants in lawsuits seeking insurance coverage under commercial insurance policies issued by the Hartford Writing Companies for alleged losses resulting from the shutdown or suspension of their businesses due to the spread of COVID-19. More than 300 such lawsuits have been filed, of which more than 60 purport to be filed on behalf of broad nationwide or statewide classes of policyholders. These lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts in roughly 35 states. Although the allegations vary, the plaintiffs generally seek a declaration of insurance coverage, damages for breach of contract in unspecified amounts, interest, and attorneys' fees. Many of the lawsuits also allege that the insurance claims were denied in bad faith or otherwise in violation of state laws and seek extra-contractual or punitive damages. Some of the lawsuits also allege that the Hartford Writing Companies engaged in unfair business practices by collecting or retaining excess premium.
The Company and its subsidiaries deny the allegations and continue to vigorously defend these suits. The Hartford Writing Companies maintain that they have no coverage obligations with respect to these suits for business income allegedly lost by the plaintiffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on the clear terms of the applicable insurance policies. Although the policy terms vary depending, among other things, upon the size, nature, and location of the policyholder’s business, in general, the claims at issue in these lawsuits were denied because the claimant identified no direct physical damage or loss to property at the insured premises, and the governmental orders that led to the complete or partial shutdown of the business were not due to the existence of any direct physical damage or loss in the immediate vicinity of the insured premises and did not prohibit access to the insured premises, as required by the terms of the insurance policies. In addition, the vast majority of the policies at issue expressly exclude from coverage any loss caused directly

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

or indirectly by the presence, growth, proliferation, spread or activity of a virus, subject to a narrow set of exceptions not applicable in connection with this pandemic, and contain a pollution and contamination exclusion that, among other things, expressly excludes from coverage any loss caused by material that threatens human health or welfare.
In addition to the inherent difficulty in predicting litigation outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic business income coverage lawsuits present numerous uncertainties and contingencies that are not yet fully known, including how many additional claims or lawsuits could be filed, the extent to which any state or nationwide classes will be certified, and the size and scope of any such classes. The legal theories advocated by plaintiffs vary significantly by case as do the state laws that govern the policy interpretation. These lawsuits are at various stages of litigation: some are in the earliest stages of litigation, some complaints may be amended, some have been dismissed voluntarily and may be refiled, while many have been dismissed through rulings in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies. Discovery is underway in certain single plaintiff cases and class actions. More than 60 policyholders have appealed dismissals in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies. To date, The Hartford Writing Companies have received fourteen appellate affirmances of trial court decisions in the Hartford Writing Companies' favor, including decisions from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeal, as well as from one state supreme court and two state appellate courts. The remainder of the Hartford Writing Companies' appeals are at various stages of the appellate process or have been remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, business income calculations depend upon a wide range of factors that are particular to the circumstances of each individual policyholder and, here, almost none of the plaintiffs have submitted proofs of loss or otherwise quantified or factually supported any allegedly covered loss, and, in any event, the Company’s experience shows that demands for damages often bear little relation to a reasonable estimate of potential loss. Accordingly, management cannot now reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any. Nonetheless, given the large number of claims and potential claims, the indeterminate amounts sought, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that adverse outcomes, if any, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated operating results or liquidity.
Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims
The Company continues to receive A&E claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.
The vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to Run-off A&E reported within the P&C Other Operations segment. In addition, since 1986, the Company has written asbestos and environmental exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments, respectively.
Prior to 1986, the Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover A&E claims. First, the

Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages.
Significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.
In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent and emerging legal doctrines with respect to the underlying claims and with respect to the Company's coverage obligations. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers, insolvencies of insureds and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for A&E claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.
In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages against insureds, emerging risks such as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"), the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent and emerging legal doctrines concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and the scope and level of complexity of the remediation required by regulators.
The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to A&E claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.
It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of A&E claims.
Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for A&E exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly

190

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

evaluates new account information in assessing its potential A&E exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.
While the Company believes that its current A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not estimable now, could be material to The Hartford’s consolidated operating results or liquidity.
For its Run-off A&E, as of December 31, 2022, the Company reported $390 of net asbestos and environmental reserves, including the benefit of losses ceded to the A&E ADC. In addition, the Company has recorded a $594 deferred gain within other liabilities for losses economically ceded to NICO but for which the benefit is not recognized in earnings until later periods. While the Company believes that its current run-off A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results or liquidity.
The Company’s A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO reinsures substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years, including Run-off A&E and A&E reserves included in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The A&E ADC has a coverage limit of $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred $1,244 in cumulative adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO, leaving $256 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative adverse development of A&E claims for accident years 2016 and prior could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results or liquidity. For more information on the A&E ADC, refer to Note 11, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

Unfunded Commitments
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $2.8 billion, of which $2.1 billion is primarily committed to fund limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. The funding of purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments are at the discretion of the general partner or manager and may be called at any time. Additionally, $335 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding

obligations primarily associated with private debt. The remaining outstanding commitments of $351 relate to mortgage loans. Of the $2.8 billion in total outstanding commitments, $66 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-related Assessments
In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.
Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the liability balance was $82 and $74, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $1 and $0 of premium tax offsets related to guaranty fund or other insurance-related assessments.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could, in certain instances, terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement.
The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2022 was $8 for which the legal entities have posted collateral of $8 in the normal course of business. Based on derivative contractual terms as of December 31, 2022, a downgrade of the current financial strength ratings by either Moody's or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. This requirement could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in

contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the additional collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.

Guarantees
In the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any material payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any material liabilities associated with these guarantees.
The Hartford has guaranteed the timely payment of contractual claims under certain life, accident and health and annuity contracts issued by its former life and annuity business with most of the guaranteed contracts issued between 1990 and 1997 (the "Talcott Guarantees"). Upon the sale of the life and annuity business in May 2018, the purchaser indemnified the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The Talcott Guarantees cover contractual obligations only but otherwise have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company had not recorded a liability because the likelihood of any payment under the Talcott Guarantees is remote. Upon adoption of new credit

loss guidance on January 1, 2020, the Company estimated a LCL of $25. For further information refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.
The LCL for Talcott Guarantees is calculated for the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts multiplied by the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned by credit rating of the applicable insurance company that issued the contract and is based on historical insurance industry defaults for liabilities with similar durations estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are current and forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. Because annuities represent the majority of the contracts issued, the loss given default factors are based on a historical study of annuity policyholder recoveries from insolvent estate assets. The Company's exposure is expected to run off over a period that will include more than one economic cycle.
The Company's evaluation of the required LCL for the Talcott Guarantees considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL for mortgage loans. See Note 5 - Investments. In 2020, the LCL increased to $26 primarily due to the increasing impacts of COVID-19. In 2021, the LCL decreased to $25 primarily reflecting a decrease in the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts as well as lessening expected impacts of COVID-19 relative to prior assumptions. During 2022, the LCL decreased to $22 primarily reflecting a decrease in the estimated amount payable under guaranteed contracts. The Company has never experienced a loss on financial guarantees similar to the Talcott Guarantees and we believe the risk of loss is remote.

 15. EQUITY

Equity Repurchase Program
In July, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization for up to $3.0 billion effective from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $2.75 billion remaining for equity repurchases under this share repurchase program.
The Hartford's $3.0 billion equity repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in December 2020, expired on December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $1.6 billion (22.3 million shares) and $1.7 billion (25.9 million shares), respectively, of common stock under these repurchase programs. During the period from January 1, 2023 through February 23, 2023, the Company repurchased $209 (2.7 million shares) under these repurchase programs.
The timing of any repurchases of shares under the remaining equity repurchase authorization is dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, the Company's blackout periods, and other considerations.

Under The Hartford’s previous $1.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in February 2019 and which expired on December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2.7 million shares for $150 during the year ended 2020.
Preferred Stock
The Company has outstanding 13.8 million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share). The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Dividends are recorded when declared. Dividends are payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, no dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.
The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2023 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to

----------------- --------------------------------------------------------
 Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules
Table of Contents Note 15 - Equity

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

the current dividend period. Prior to November 15, 2023, the Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence of (a) a rating agency event at a redemption price equal to $25,500 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a rating agency changes its criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Preferred Stock; or (b) a regulatory capital event at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a capital regulator such as a state insurance regulator changes or proposes to change capital adequacy rules.

Statutory Results
The U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, recognize a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance within a special surplus account rather than as other liabilities, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively as "statutory capital".

Property and Casualty Insurance Subsidiaries 12,111 11,914
Total $ 14,682 $ 14,324

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum

amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Dividend Restrictions
Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States and the United Kingdom.
The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the preceding year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner.
Property casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company ("NSIC"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period.
Corporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL") capital requirement and subject to restrictions imposed under UK Company Law. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement of the syndicate under the Solvency II capital adequacy model, the current regulatory framework governing UK domiciled insurers, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment. Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to its parent out of its statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and Solvency II.
The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity requirements and state deposit requirements of the individual operating company.
In 2022, the Company received $240 of dividends from HLA and $157 from Hartford Funds. In addition, HFSG Holding Company received $1.4 billion of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries in 2022 which excludes $395 of P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and $50 of P&C dividends related to interest payments on an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holding Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company.
The Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have regulatory dividend capacity of $1.8 billion for 2023, and expects available net dividends to the HFSG Holding Company of $1.5 billion after considering state deposit and regulatory

capital requirements to support growth in certain entities, dividends that are expected to be subsequently contributed to P&C subsidiaries and dividends related to interest on intercompany notes. The HFSG Holding Company expects to receive approximately $1.5 billion of net dividends from the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in 2023.
HLA has regulatory dividend capacity of $408 in 2023 with approximately $400 of dividends expected in 2023.
There are no current restrictions on HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.
Restricted Net Assets
As of December 31, 2022, the Company's insurance subsidiaries had net assets of $12.9 billion, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that were restricted from payment to the HFSG Holding Company, without prior regulatory approval.

16. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Expense
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $2,256, $2,910 and $2,222 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $2, $(14) and $(102) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent the tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
The Company predominantly pays non-income state taxes as a percentage of premiums written which are accounted for as policy acquisition costs. State income taxes were $4, $4 and $3 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in other expenses. The Hartford has not recorded state deferred taxes, including net deferred tax assets from state operating loss carryforwards, because the Company does not expect to earn state taxable income to utilize such state tax benefits.

Net deferred tax asset $ 1,449 $ 270

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses of $37 partially offset by a valuation allowance of $27. While the foreign net operating losses ("NOLs") do not expire, this assessment reflects uncertainty in the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the near term in those specific jurisdictions.
Management has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on tax character and jurisdiction. In making the assessment, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, the ability to hold assets to recovery, and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies which management views as prudent and feasible.

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release. In 2021, the Company recognized $5 of its previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with dividends from segregated asset accounts of the life and annuity business sold in 2018. This liability was subject to a tax indemnification agreement and a corresponding receivable included in other assets has been taken down upon lapse of the statute of limitations.
Other Tax Matters
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) which is generally effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. Notably, guidance. The Company has made certain interpretations and assumptions to comply with the CAMT. While the Company's financial statement income is over $1 billion, it is not expected a temporary item reflected within deferred taxes.
The federal income tax audits for the Company have been completed through 2013, and the Company is not currently under federal income tax examination for any open years. The statute of limitations is closed through the 2018 tax year with the exception of NOL carryforwards utilized in open tax years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.
The Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized net interest expense of $1 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and net interest income of $1 and $1 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Investment and Savings Plan
Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of investments, including up to 10% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of 2.0% of eligible compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 6.0% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee each pay period. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions related to employee compensation in excess of the amount of eligible compensation that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the Investment and Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan combined, is limited to $1 annually. The total cost to The Hartford for these plans was approximately

$142, $147 and $153 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Additionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 for these plans was immaterial.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plan- The Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Pension Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations, as well as a Canadian defined benefit pension plan. Together, the non-

Table of Contents Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

qualified and Canadian defined benefit plan are referred to as "Other Pension Plans".
The U.S. Pension Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances. Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. The interest crediting rate on the cash balance plan is the greater of the average annual yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities published in December of the prior calendar year or 3.3%. The Hartford Excess Pension Plan I and The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plans for certain highly compensated employees, are also frozen.
Group Retiree Health Plan- The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits are a function of the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014.
Assumptions
Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two

economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plans and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The yield curve used to determine the discount rate is based on high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the highest yields grouped by duration. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that 5.43% and 5.39% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2022 to calculate the Company’s U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively.
The expected long-term rate of return considers the actual compound rates of return earned over various historical time periods. The Company also considers the plan's funded status, the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. For the pension plan, the Company has assumed an allocation of approximately 73% in fixed income securities and 27% in non-fixed income securities (global equities, hedge funds and private market alternatives) in its assumed expected long-term rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2022, whereas the Company anticipated an allocation of 65% in fixed income securities and 35% in non-fixed income securities to derive an expected long-term rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the other postretirement plans, the Company has assumed an allocation of approximately 75% in fixed income securities and 25% in non-fixed income securities in its assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be 5.10% and 4.80% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 5.40% and 4.90% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the Company's 2023 expense, the Company has assumed an allocation of 81% in fixed income securities and 19% in non-fixed income securities for the pension plan and an allocation of 100% in fixed income securities for the postretirement plans, contributing to an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.10% and 4.50% for the Company's U.S. Pension Plan and other postretirement obligations, respectively.

Changes in assumptions for the U.S. Pension Plan in 2022 primarily included a $997 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 2.91% as of the December 31, 2021 valuation to 5.43% as of the December 31, 2022 valuation. Changes in assumptions in 2021 included a $109 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 2.65% as of the December 31, 2020 valuation to 2.91% as of the December 31, 2021 valuation.
Changes in assumptions for the Other Pension Plans in 2022 primarily included a $92 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 2.83% as of the December 31, 2021 valuation to 5.40% as of the December 31, 2022 valuation. Changes in assumptions in 2021 included a $12 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 2.51% as of the December 31, 2020 valuation to 2.83% as of the December 31, 2021 valuation.
Included in the benefit obligation for the U.S. Pension Plan in the table above, the cash balance plan pension benefit obligation was $338 and $414 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The fair value of assets for total pension plans, and hence the funded status, presented in the table above excludes assets of $170 and $210 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, held in rabbi trusts and designated for the Other Pension Plans. The assets do not qualify as plan assets; however, the assets are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and active participants. Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of insolvency. The rabbi trusts assets consist of equity and fixed income investments. To the extent the fair value of these rabbi trusts were included in the table above, total pension plan assets would have been $3,694 and $4,692 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the funded status of total pension plans would have been $204 and $43 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The tables below present an aggregate view of net periodic cost (benefit) and components of other comprehensive income and AOCI for pension plans that includes both the U.S. Pension Plan and Other Pension Plans. Net periodic cost (benefit) is recognized in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Pension Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the U.S. Pension Plan is to produce total investment returns that provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the U.S. Pension Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; selecting qualified service providers such as investment managers and investment consultants; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Pension Investment Committee has adopted a de-risking glide path that reduces the target allocation to equity securities and alternative assets and

increases the allocation to fixed income securities over time in response to improvement in the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plan. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the U.S. Pension Plan.
Target Asset Allocation Ranges

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum
Equity securities — % 20 % — % — %
Fixed income securities 75 % 95 % 100 % 100 %
Alternative assets — % 25 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes and changes in the context of the glide path may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and

withdrawals will be used first, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges, before shifting assets across portfolios.
The U.S. Pension Plan invests in investment portfolios managed by affiliated and unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the U.S. Pension Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the U.S. Pension Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative

investments and are made up of individual investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage loans and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.
In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS, in addition to certain other investments, in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of U.S. Pension Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

The tables below provide fair value level 3 roll forwards for the U.S. Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs ("Level 3") are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The U.S. Pension Plan classifies the fair value of financial instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for the instruments or, in the absence of active markets,

if one or more of the significant inputs used to determine fair value are based on the U.S. Pension Plan’s own assumptions. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in fair value due to both observable and unobservable factors.

Concentration of Risk
In order to minimize risk, the Pension Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Pension Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Permissible derivative instruments include futures contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and may be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.
Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford (other than equity securities purchased on the open market as part of a passively managed strategy), short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.
Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Pension Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.
Expected Employer Contributions
The Company does not have a 2023 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U.S. qualified defined benefit

pension plan in 2023. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2023 to make this determination.

19. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation.
The Hartford measures stock compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:
Stock-Based Compensation Expense

---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ---
 For the years ended December 31,
 2022 2021 2020
Stock-based compensation plans expense $ 131 $ 128 $ 116
Income tax benefit (22) (22) (20)
Excess tax benefit on awards vested, exercised and expired (12) (6) (1)
Total stock-based compensation plans expense, net of tax $ 97 $ 100 $ 95

The Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2022, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $66, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.

Stock Plan
Future stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the 2020 Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third-party service providers during the 10-year duration of the Stock Incentive Plan is the sum of 11,250,000 shares, any shares forfeited subsequent to February 29, 2020, plus any shares used for tax withholding purposes. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the Stock Incentive Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2022, there were 8,181,554 shares available for future issuance.
The fair values of awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally 3 years. For stock awards to retirement-eligible employees, the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and, therefore, the vesting period is considered non-substantive.

Table of Contents Note 19 - Stock Compensation Plans

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Stock Option Awards
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a period of three years commencing one year from the date of grant.
The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “Plan Valuation Model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The Plan Valuation Model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.
The Plan Valuation Model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term

structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the Plan Valuation Model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option Plan Valuation Model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Performance share awards that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest based on the performance level achieved and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.
Other performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total stockholder

return relative to a group of peer companies within a period of three years from the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo Plan Valuation Model that incorporates time to maturity, implied volatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and correlations between the Company and the peer companies and interest rates.

shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2022, there were 3,350,171 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 194,504 shares, 199,173 shares, and 340,653 shares were sold, respectively.

21. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS

Sale of Continental Europe Operations
On December 29, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Continental Europe Operations for approximately $11, net of transaction costs. The complete sale of the Continental Europe Operations consists of multiple arrangements designed as a single transaction. The Continental Europe Operations are included in the Commercial Lines segment. Revenues and earnings are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The sale resulted in losses of approximately $21 and $48, before tax, for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were recorded within net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company also recorded related income tax benefits on the sale of $5 and $18, for after tax losses of $16 and $30, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Total consideration less costs to sell of $11 is subject to change based on how the ultimate amounts required to settle claims on 2020 and prior accident years, as determined at the end of 2024, compare with recorded reserves as currently estimated. The contingent consideration has been estimated at its fair value of $0 and could result in an increase or decrease in consideration depending on how ultimate losses develop. Any change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration in a future period would increase or decrease the estimated loss on sale in that period.

22. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER COSTS

In recognition of the need to become more cost efficient and competitive along with enhancing the experience we provide to agents and customers, on July 30, 2020 the Company announced an operational transformation and cost reduction plan it refers to as Hartford Next. Hartford Next is intended to reduce annual insurance operating costs and other expenses through reduction of the Company's headcount, investment in information technology ("IT") to further enhance our capabilities, and other activities. The activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2023.
Termination benefits related to workforce reductions and professional fees are included within restructuring and other costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and unpaid restructuring costs are included in other liabilities in the

Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the severance benefits accrual was reduced by $7 and $25 respectively, due to more recent experience of higher than expected voluntary attrition. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company expects to incur additional costs including, amortization of right of use assets and other lease exit costs, other IT costs to retire applications, and other expenses. Total restructuring and other costs are expected to be approximately $125, before tax, and will be recognized in Corporate for segment reporting. The estimated restructuring and other costs for future periods do not include all costs associated with the real estate consolidation plan as those plans are still being finalized.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

If CAMT is paid in the future, the amount would be indefinitely available as a credit carryforward that would reduce tax in future years and would be treated as in excess of $1 worth of its stock in any given calendar year. The impact of this provision will depend on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. In addition, the IRA added

an $80 billion funding increase for the IRS to support tax enforcement and modernization. Increases to IRS enforcement resources could increase audits on corporate taxpayers, which may include the Company. Finally, the IRA provides the U.S. Department of Treasury with authority to promulgate additional regulations and guidance on implementing the new law.
In addition, Congress may consider a variety of proposals could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any such Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

['s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors.
Given the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2022, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company']:

[") on off balance sheet credit exposures, such as financial guarantees and mortgage loan commitments that the Company cannot unconditionally cancel.
Credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS carried at fair value continue to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows compared to amortized cost; however, the losses are now recognized through an ACL and no longer as an adjustment to the amortized cost. Recoveries of credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS are now recognized as reversals of the ACL and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The ACL on fixed maturities, AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of the ACL and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase.
The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $18, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after tax. No ACL was recognized at adoption for fixed maturities, AFS; rather, these investments are evaluated for an ACL prospectively. The Company does not have any purchased financial assets with a more than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance.

Investments
Overview
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, and redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected interests of securitizations and other securities that contain embedded credit derivatives. Equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. Mortgage and other funds are generally on a three-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of equity fund investments, overseas deposits which value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies, and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.

[") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to engage in income generation covered call transactions and replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve the following Company-approved objectives:
•to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility;
•to manage liquidity;
•to control transaction costs;
•to enter into income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions.
Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals,

calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance regulators.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company may purchase investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

Cash and Restricted Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e., risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as deposit transactions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company']:

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

The table above excludes certain securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. As of December 31, 2022, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

['s derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities or debt instruments issued.
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on variable-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month LIBOR + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedges of interest rate, foreign currency, equity, and commodity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities. In addition, hedging and replication

strategies that utilize credit default swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:
Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty or the Company should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. The Company also enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars.
Equity Index Options
The Company to generate additional return.
Commodity Options
During the first quarter of 2022, the Company paid $10 to purchase call option contracts on oil futures in order to partially offset potential changes in value related to certain fixed maturity securities that could arise if oil prices increased substantially. The option contracts were either terminated or were closed by entering into offsetting positions during the first quarter of 2022, resulting in a realized gain of $14.

For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income

accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity.

As of December 31, 2022, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $3. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities and long-term debt that will occur over the next twelve months. Over that time, the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an

adjustment to net investment income or interest expense, as applicable, over the term of the hedged instrument cash flows.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

The Company also accepted securities collateral as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 with a fair value of $1 and $5, respectively, which the Company has the right to repledge or sell. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no repledged securities. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts and was not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

[") up to an aggregate limit of $1.5 billion and the other covered substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (the Navigators ADC) up to an aggregate limit of $300. As the Company has ceded all of the $300 available limit, there is no remaining limit available as of December 31, 2022 under the Navigators ADC. For more information on ADC agreements, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.
Property and Casualty ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $1,338, $1,243 and

$1,156 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Group Benefits ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $81, $85 and $63 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Balances are considered past due when amounts that have been billed are not collected within contractually stipulated time periods, generally 30, 60 or 90 days. To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.
Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral or other credit enhancement, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers.
Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. The ACL is estimated as the amount of reinsurance recoverables exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for the probability of default and the amount of loss given a default. The probability of default is assigned based on each reinsurer']:

['s evaluation of the required ACL for reinsurance recoverables considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios similar to the approach used to estimate the ACL Non-U.S. reinsurers are either subject to a capital regime substantively equivalent to domestic insurers or we hold collateral to support collection of reinsurance recoverables. As a result, there is limited history of losses from insurer defaults. There were $0 and $1 in write-offs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that would impact the ACL. The decrease in the ACL in 2021 was primarily due to a higher than expected recovery from one reinsurer on which the Company had recognized an ACL. In 2020, the increase in the ACL includes the increasing impacts of COVID-19.

a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments.

[' fees. Many of the lawsuits also allege that the insurance claims were denied in bad faith or otherwise in violation of state laws and seek extra-contractual or punitive damages. Some of the lawsuits also allege that the Hartford Writing Companies engaged in unfair business practices by collecting or retaining excess premium.
The Company and its subsidiaries deny the allegations and continue to vigorously defend these suits. The Hartford Writing Companies maintain that they have no coverage obligations with respect to these suits for business income allegedly lost by the plaintiffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on the clear terms of the applicable insurance policies. Although the policy terms vary depending, among other things, upon the size, nature, and location of the policyholder’s business, in general, the claims at issue in these lawsuits were denied because the claimant identified no direct physical damage or loss to property at the insured premises, and the governmental orders that led to the complete or partial shutdown of the business were not due to the existence of any direct physical damage or loss in the immediate vicinity of the insured premises and did not prohibit access to the insured premises, as required by the terms of the insurance policies. In addition, the vast majority of the policies at issue expressly exclude from coverage any loss caused directly

In addition to the inherent difficulty in predicting litigation outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic business income coverage lawsuits present numerous uncertainties and contingencies that are not yet fully known, including how many additional claims or lawsuits could be filed, the extent to which any state or nationwide classes will be certified, and the size and scope of any such classes. The legal theories advocated by plaintiffs vary significantly by case as do the state laws that govern the policy interpretation. These lawsuits are at various stages of litigation: some are in the earliest stages of litigation, some complaints may be amended, some have been dismissed voluntarily and may be refiled, while many have been dismissed through rulings in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies. Discovery is underway in certain single plaintiff cases and class actions. More than 60 policyholders have appealed dismissals in favor of the Hartford Writing Companies. To date, The Hartford Writing Companies have received fourteen appellate affirmances of trial court decisions in the Hartford Writing Companies']:

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.

Under The Hartford’s previous $1.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in February 2019 and which expired on December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2.7 million shares for $150 during the year ended 2020.
Preferred Stock
The Company has outstanding 13.8 million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share). The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Dividends are recorded when declared. Dividends are payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, no dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.
The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2023 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to

Prior to November 15, 2023, the Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence of (a) a rating agency event at a redemption price equal to $25,500 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a rating agency changes its criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Preferred Stock; or (b) a regulatory capital event at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a capital regulator such as a state insurance regulator changes or proposes to change capital adequacy rules.

Statutory Results
The U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, recognize a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance within a special surplus account rather than as other liabilities, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance.

Total restructuring and other costs are expected to be approximately $125, before tax, and will be recognized in Corporate for segment reporting.

Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.
•Internal matrix pricing is a valuation process and term to maturity, using an independent public security index, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.
