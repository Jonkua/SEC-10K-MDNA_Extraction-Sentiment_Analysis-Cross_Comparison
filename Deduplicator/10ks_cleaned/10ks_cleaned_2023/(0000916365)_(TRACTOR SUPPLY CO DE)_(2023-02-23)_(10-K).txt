Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, existing store remodeling and improvements, store relocations, distribution facility capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities, share repurchases, cash dividends, and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.

Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, remaining funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit.  Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.

We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, normal trade credit, and access to the long-term debt capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital allocation needs through the end of fiscal 2023.

Working Capital

At December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $781.6 million, which decreased $404.0 million from fiscal 2021.  The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):

---------------------------------------------- ----------------- ----- ----------------- ------- -------- ------- ------ - -------
 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Variance
Current assets:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 202.5 $ 878.0 $ (675.5)

Total current liabilities 2,376.2 2,064.8 311.4
Working capital $ 781.6 $ 1,185.6 $ (404.0)

Note: amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding

In comparison to December 25, 2021, working capital as of December 31, 2022 was impacted most significantly by changes in cash and cash equivalents, inventories, and accounts payable.

•The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by capital expenditures to support strategic growth, share repurchases, cash dividends to stockholders, and the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, partially offset by positive cash flows generated from operations and net borrowings under the Company’s debt facilities.
•The increase in inventories and accounts payable resulted from an increase in average inventory per store driven by our commitment to support our strong sales trends, combined with the impact inflation had on retail prices. Additionally, overall inventory and accounts payable levels increased from the acquisition of Orscheln and the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth.

We manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable market costs. As of December 31, 2022, and the date of this filing, February 23, 2023, the Company's senior unsecured debt is rated “Baa1,” by Moody’s Investor Services with a stable outlook and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook. These ratings have been obtained with the understanding that Moody’s Investors Services and Standard & Poor’s will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Our current ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms and affect our financing costs. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings.

On September 30, 2022, we entered into a new credit agreement, providing for a credit facility (the “2022 Senior Credit Facility”), consisting of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in the maximum principal amount of $1.20 billion (with a sublimit of $50.0 million for swingline loans and a sublimit of $150.0 million for letters of credit). In addition, we have an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility or establish term loans in an amount not to exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to, among other things, the receipt of commitments for the increase amount. The 2022 Senior Credit Facility is unsecured and has a five year term with two options to request that the lenders extend the maturity date of the obligations owed to each lender for one year (and the right to replace any lenders electing not to extend).

For additional information about the Company’s debt and credit facilities, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities.  Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and acquisitions while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.

Operating Activities

Operating activities provided cash of $1.36 billion and $1.14 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $218.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021, was due to changes in the following (in millions):

----------------------------------------- ----------- ------- ---------- ------- - ------- ------- - -----

Other, net 51.3 (37.2) 88.5
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,357.0 $ 1,138.7 $ 218.3

The $218.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily driven by a year-over-year increase in our net income as well as the net impact of changes in our operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the Company's strategic initiatives as well as the timing of accruals and related payments.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used cash of $1.09 billion and $627.3 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The $466.4 million increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home as well as an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by cash received from Orscheln stores divestitures.

Index

Investing activities, including capital expenditures, for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):

-------------------------------------------------- ----------- ------- ---------- ----- - ----- ----- ------ - -----

Proceeds from sale of business assets (69.4) — $ (69.4)
Net cash used in investing activities $ 1,093.7 $ 627.3 $ 466.4

The increase in spending for existing stores in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily reflects our strategic initiatives related to store remodels, including internal space productivity and the outside garden center transformations. Spending in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 also includes routine refresh activity, as well as security enhancements.

The increase in spending for distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily related to the construction of new distribution centers in Navarre, Ohio and Maumelle, Arkansas. On January 18, 2023, the Company opened its ninth distribution center located in Navarre, Ohio, which expanded the distribution center capacity by approximately 900,000 square feet. The Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center is currently expected to begin operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and will expand our distribution capacity by approximately 1,200,000 square feet.

The above table reflects an investment in 63 new Tractor Supply stores, nine new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores, and seven store relocations during fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and seven new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores and had three store relocations.

The increase in spending for new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the timing of stores openings, as well as acceleration of spend in 2022 for stores expected to open in 2023.

The spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omni-channel initiatives, as well as improvements in security and compliance and other strategic initiatives.

Overall cash flow used in investing activities was also impacted by the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home and the subsequent store divestitures to Bomgaars Supply, Inc. and Buchheit Enterprises, Inc.

Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately $700.0 million to $775.0 million. The capital expenditures include a plan to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply stores, complete the Orscheln conversions to Tractor Supply, continue the remodeling of our stores (“Project Fusion”) and garden center transformations, and open 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. Additionally, we anticipate the continued build out of our tenth distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas during 2023 with operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We also plan to support our continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores, along with ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omni-channel capabilities to better serve our customers.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used cash of $938.8 million and $975.1 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $36.3 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021, was due to changes in the following (in millions):

Index

--------------------------------------------------- ----------- ------- ---------- ------ -------- ----- ------ - -------
 Fiscal Year

 2022 2021 Variance
 (53 weeks) (52 weeks)
Net borrowings and repayments under debt facilities $ (178.0) $ — $ (178.0)
Repurchase of common stock 700.1 798.9 (98.8)
Net proceeds from issuance of common stock (25.5) (82.2) 56.7
Cash dividends paid to stockholders 409.6 239.0 170.6
Other, net 32.6 19.4 13.2
Net cash used in financing activities $ 938.8 $ 975.1 $ (36.3)

The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily due to borrowings under our new 2022 Senior Credit Facility and increased returns of capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.

Repurchase of Common Stock

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in February 2007. The authorization amount of the program, which has been increased from time to time, is currently authorized for up to $6.50 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. The authorized amount reflects a $2.00 billion increase to the share repurchase program which was approved by our Board of Directors on January 26, 2022. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited, temporarily paused, or terminated at any time without prior notice.

We repurchased approximately 3.4 million and 4.4 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $700.1 million and $798.9 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Our projected share repurchases for fiscal 2023 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately $575 million to $675 million.

Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders

We paid cash dividends totaling $409.6 million and $239.0 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of $3.68 per common share outstanding as compared to $2.08 per common share outstanding in fiscal 2021. These payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in all four quarters of fiscal 2022 to $0.92 per share from $0.52 per share in all four quarters of fiscal 2021.

On February 8, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.03 per share of the Company’s outstanding common stock.  The dividend will be paid on March 14, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 27, 2023.

It is the present intention of the Company’s Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment amount of future dividends will be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, along with any other factors which the Company’s Board of Directors deem relevant.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

On September 30, 2022, we entered into a new credit agreement, providing for a credit facility (the “2022 Senior Credit Facility”), consisting of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in the maximum principal amount of $1.20 billion (with a sublimit of $50.0 million for swingline loans and a sublimit of $150.0 million for letters of credit). In addition, we have an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility or establish term loans in an amount not to exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to, among other things, the receipt of commitments for the increase amount. The 2022 Senior Credit Facility is unsecured and has a five year term with two options to request that the lenders extend the maturity date of the obligations owed to each lender for one year (and the right to replace any lenders electing not to extend).
