Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We are the world’s leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Our Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service. Through our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We sell our New Equipment directly to customers, as well as through agents and distributors.

Through our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services for both our own products and those of other manufacturers and provide modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Maintenance services include inspections to ensure code compliance, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs, as well as repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear and breakdowns. Modernization services enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our typical Service customers include building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed.

We function under a centralized operating model whereby we pursue a global strategy set around New Equipment and Service, in large measure, because we seek to grow our maintenance portfolio, in part, through the conversion of new elevator and escalator installations into service contracts. Accordingly, we benefit from an integrated global strategy, which sets priorities and establishes accountability across the full product lifecycle.

For additional discussion of our business, refer to Item 1 in this Form 10-K.

Sale of Russia business and risks associated with ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatile commodity markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents, reputational risk, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia).

To the extent possible, we continue to operate our business in Ukraine, which represented less than 1% of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 revenue and operating profit.

As previously disclosed, we stopped taking new equipment orders in Russia and making new investments in the country in March 2022, while reassessing our operations in the country, which represented approximately 1% and 2% of both our revenue and operating profit in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The operations were comprised mostly of New Equipment. In June 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our business in Russia to a third party, resulting in classification of the business' assets and liabilities as held for sale as of June 30, 2022 and recording an impairment loss of $18 million. On July 27, 2022, we completed the sale of our business in Russia to the third party. We recorded losses from the sale and conflict-related charges totaling $28 million (including the impairment loss of $18 million), primarily in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022. See Note 9, "Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for further details.

Consistent with our risk management process, the Otis Board of Directors and its Audit Committee received numerous updates on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and have reviewed, and continue to review, with management the financial, operational, compliance, reputational and cyber risks associated therewith and related mitigation actions. The Otis Board of Directors oversaw the process of selling our business in Russia, including reviewing the terms and conditions thereof, and the Audit Committee approved the sale. The Otis Board of Directors continued to receive updates on the sale process until the completion of the sale.

See Item 1A in this Form 10-K for risks associated with ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Zardoya Otis Tender Offer

As previously disclosed, the Company announced the Tender Offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Zardoya Otis not owned by Otis, at an offer price of €7.07 per share in cash, after adjusting for dividends. The results of the Tender Offer were announced on April 7, 2022, with tenders of 45.49% of the shares outstanding accepted. The shares tendered to the Company were settled in cash on April 12, 2022 for approximately €1.5 billion from the Company's restricted cash held in escrow, resulting in the Company owning 95.51% of Zardoya Otis. The acquisition and settlement of the remaining issued and outstanding shares not owned by the Company for approximately €150 million (based on the adjusted tender price of €7.07 per share) and the automatic delisting of Zardoya Otis shares both occurred during the second quarter of 2022. Zardoya Otis was renamed Otis Mobility upon completion of the Tender Offer and delisting.

See Note 1, "Business Overview" and Note 10, "Borrowings and Lines of Credit" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further details regarding this transaction and financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Tender Offer.

Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")

There have been no, and we do not expect there to be in the near term, material impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change, from the known physical effects of climate change or as a result of implementing our ESG initiatives. Increased regulation (including pending SEC and European Union requirements) and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and we are not able to predict how such regulations or concerns would affect our business, operations or financial results. For a discussion of risks associated with ESG matters, see Item 1A in this Form 10-K.

For a discussion of Otis’ ESG goals, see the discussion under “Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)” in Item 1 in this Form 10-K.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Company

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, aspects of the Company's operations and overall financial performance. COVID-19 related trends impacting our business, customers and suppliers have had, and could continue to have, an impact on our business, including impacts to overall financial performance in 2023, as a result of the following, among other things:

•Supplier and raw material capacity constraints, delays and related costs;
•Customer demand impacting our new equipment, maintenance and repair, and modernization businesses;
•Customer liquidity constraints and related credit reserves; and
•Cancellations or delays of customer orders.

We currently do not expect any significant impact to our capital and financial resources from the COVID-19 pandemic, including our overall liquidity position based on our available cash and cash equivalents and our access to credit facilities and the capital markets.

See the "Liquidity and Financial Condition" section of this item of this Form 10-K for further detail and Item 1A in this Form 10-K for additional risks related to COVID-19.

Separation from United Technologies Corporation

As previously disclosed, on April 3, 2020, Otis became an independent, publicly-traded company and its Common Stock is listed under the symbol "OTIS" on the New York Stock Exchange as a result of the separation (the "Separation") of each of Otis and Carrier Global Corporation ("Carrier") from United Technologies Corporation, subsequently renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation ("UTC" or "RTX", as applicable).

Prior to the Separation on April 3, 2020, our historical financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of our former parent, UTC. For the periods subsequent to April 3, 2020, our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis as the Company became a standalone public company.

29

Table of Contents

We entered into a transition services agreement (the "TSA") and tax matters agreement (the "TMA") with our former parent, UTC, and Carrier on April 2, 2020. Under the TSA, we received services for information technology, technical and engineering support, application support for operations, general administrative services and other support services. The TSA and the related trailing exit costs were substantially completed as of December 31, 2021. For additional discussion, see "Note 5: Related Parties" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

The TMA governs the parties’ respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax matters (including responsibility for taxes, entitlement to refunds, allocation of tax attributes, preparation of tax returns, control of tax contests and other tax matters). For additional discussion, see "Note 5: Related Parties" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

See Item 1A in this Form 10-K for discussion on risks related to Separation.

As a result of our business in Russia being sold during 2022, the results of the operations in Russia are excluded from the organic volume changes for 2022 and 2021 and are reflected in Acquisitions and divestitures, net. See Note 9, "Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Sales

-------------------------------- ----- ------ ---- ---- ---- ------ ----- - - ------
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Net sales $ 13,685 $ 14,298 $ 12,756
Percentage change year-over-year (4.3) % 12.1 % (2.8) %

The factors contributing to the total percentage change year-over-year in total Net sales are as follows:

---------------------------------- ----- - ---- ---- -
 2022 2021
Organic volume 2.5 % 9.0 %
Foreign currency translation (5.9) % 3.0 %
Acquisitions and divestitures, net (0.9) % 0.1 %

Total % change (4.3) % 12.1 %

The Organic volume increase of 2.5% for 2022 was driven by an increase of 6.0% in Service, offset by a decrease of (1.7)% in New Equipment.

The Organic volume increase of 9.0% for 2021 was driven by increases of 15.8% in New Equipment and 4.1% in Service.

See "Segment Review" below for a discussion of Net sales by segment.

Cost of Products and Services Sold

---------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ---- ---- ------ ----- - - -----
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Cost of products and services sold $ 9,765 $ 10,105 $ 8,977
Percentage change year-over-year (3.4) % 12.6 % (3.4) %

The factors contributing to the percentage change year-over-year in total cost of products and services sold are as follows:

---------------------------------- ----- - ---- ---- -
 2022 2021
Organic volume 3.7 % 9.1 %
Foreign currency translation (6.1) % 3.3 %
Acquisitions and divestitures, net (1.0) % 0.2 %

Total % change (3.4) % 12.6 %

The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2022 was driven primarily by the organic sales increases noted above and inflationary pressures including higher commodity prices of $107 million, primarily driven by steel, higher freight and fuel costs and annual wage increases, partially mitigated by productivity.

The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2021 was driven primarily by the organic sales increases noted above.

Gross Margin

----------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Gross margin $ 3,920 $ 4,193 $ 3,779
Gross margin percentage 28.6 % 29.3 % 29.6 %

Gross margin decreased 70 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021, due to the inflationary pressures described above, partially offset by favorable Service pricing, productivity and the benefit from Service sales growing faster than New Equipment sales.

Gross margin decreased 30 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020, as improvements in gross margin in both New Equipment and Service were more than offset by overall segment mix.

Research and Development

------------------------ ---- --- ---- --- ---- --- --- - - ---
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Research and development $ 150 $ 159 $ 152
Percentage of Net sales 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.2 %

Research and development was relatively flat in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. Research and development includes product development and innovation, including for IoT and developing the next generation of connected elevators and escalators.

Selling, General and Administrative

----------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Selling, general and administrative $ 1,763 $ 1,948 $ 1,924
Percentage of Net sales 12.9 % 13.6 % 15.1 %

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $185 million in 2022 compared to 2021, as other employment related cost reductions, cost containment actions, lower credit loss reserves, as well as the impact from foreign exchange of $104 million, were partially offset by annual wage increases.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $24 million in 2021 compared to 2020, as higher employment and information technology costs, including incremental standalone public company costs, and the absence of cost containment actions taken during 2020 in response to COVID-19, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of $38 million compared to 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower non-recurring Separation-related costs and the absence of UTC allocations of $105 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales decreased 70 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021, and decreased 150 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020.

Restructuring Costs

--------------------- ---- -- ---- - ---- - --
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Restructuring costs $ 60 $ 56 $ 77

We initiate restructuring actions to keep our cost structure competitive. Charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions, and to a lesser degree, facility exit and lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of office and manufacturing operations. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions.

Most of the expected charges will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations.

The table below presents approximate cash outflows related to the restructuring actions during the year ended December 31, 2022, and the expected cash payments to complete the actions announced:

-------------------------------------------------------------- -- --
(dollars in millions)
Cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2022 $ 59
Expected cash payments remaining to complete actions announced 49

We generally expect to achieve annual recurring savings within the two-year period subsequent to initiating the actions, including $67 million for the 2022 actions and $37 million for the 2021 actions, of which approximately $68 million was realized for the 2022 and 2021 actions during the year ended December 31, 2022.

For additional discussion of restructuring, see Note 17, "Restructuring Costs" in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Income (Expense), Net

--------------------------- ---- -- ---- - ---- - ----
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Other income (expense), net $ 26 $ 22 $ (64)

Other income (expense), net primarily includes the impact of changes in the fair value and settlement of derivatives, gains or losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets, earnings from equity method investments, fair value changes on equity securities, impairments, non-recurring Separation-related expenses and certain other operating items.

The change in Other income (expense), net of $4 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency mark-to-market adjustments, lower non-recurring Separation-related costs and settlement of certain legal matters, partially offset by the impact of the loss on the sale of our Russia business.

The change in Other income (expense), net of $86 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of a fixed asset impairment of $(71) million and related licensing costs of $(14) million recognized during 2020.

See "Note 5: Related Parties" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion on costs related to the Separation.

Interest Expense (Income), Net

------------------------------ ---- --- ---- - ---- - ---
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020

Interest expense (income), net $ 143 $ 136 $ 122

Interest expense (income), net primarily relates to interest expense on our external debt, offset by interest income earned on cash balances and short-term investments.

The increase in Interest expense (income), net of $7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by interest expense related to the financing of the Tender Offer for Zardoya Otis.

The increase in Interest expense (income), net of $14 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by interest expense on the external debt associated with the Separation, which was not outstanding for the full year of 2020, as well as costs associated with the bridge financing and related guarantees and the interest expense related to the Tender Offer. This was partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of the debt refinancing and debt repayments during 2021. For additional discussion of debt refinancing and repayments, see the "Liquidity and Financial Condition" section below.

The average interest rate on our external debt for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 2.0%, 2.3% and 2.3%, respectively.

For additional discussion of borrowings, see "Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

Income Taxes

------------------ ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- -
 2022 2021 2020
Effective tax rate 27.5 % 27.6 % 30.1 %

The 2022, 2021 and 2020 effective tax rates are higher than the statutory U.S. rate primarily due to higher international tax rates as compared to the lower U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the 2020 effective tax rate is also higher due to foreign earnings subject to U.S. tax under the provisions of the TCJA.

The 2022 effective tax rate is lower than the 2021 effective tax rate primarily due to the elimination of Base Erosion Anti Abuse Tax ("BEAT") in the U.S., and the release of a tax reserve related to a forward transfer pricing agreement with a European tax authority. This is partially offset by the absence of a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021, and the absence of a favorable income tax settlement related to the Separation recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.

33

Table of Contents
The 2021 effective tax rate is lower than the 2020 effective tax rate primarily due to a $16 million tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of changes to planned debt repayments and in estimates related to Otis’ pre-Separation tax attributes and a decrease of $16 million in U.S. tax related to base erosion and anti-abuse tax in 2021. In addition, the lower effective tax rate is due to the absence of the tax cost resulting from Separation-related expenses and fixed asset impairment in 2020, and the net impact of income tax settlements related to the Separation, as discussed in Note 5, "Related Parties".

For additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see "Note 16: Income Taxes" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries' Earnings and Net Income Attributable to Otis Worldwide Corporation

----------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - ----- - ---
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries' earnings $ 116 $ 174 $ 150
Net income attributable to Otis Worldwide Corporation $ 1,253 $ 1,246 $ 906

Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries' earnings decreased in 2022 in comparison to 2021 primarily due to Otis' acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares in Otis Mobility (previously Zardoya Otis) in the second quarter of 2022. For details on the results of the Tender Offer and purchases of shares of Zardoya Otis not previously owned by the Company "Note 1: Business Overview" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries' earnings increased in 2021 in comparison to 2020 primarily driven by an increase in net income from non-wholly owned subsidiaries and the impact of foreign exchange rates.

Net income attributable to Otis Worldwide Corporation was relatively flat in 2022 compared to 2021, as lower noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries’ earnings and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate were offset by lower operating profit (including the impact of foreign exchange rates) and higher interest expense.

Net income attributable to Otis Worldwide Corporation increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher operating profit and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries' earnings and higher interest expense.

New Equipment

The New Equipment segment designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways in residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We sell directly to customers as well as through agents and distributors. We also sell New Equipment to government agencies to support infrastructure projects, such as airports, railways or metros.

2022 Compared with 2021

Organic sales declined (1.7)% as a 10% decline in China was partially offset by high single digit growth in Asia Pacific and mid single digit growth in EMEA.

New Equipment operating profit decreased $(101) million. Lower volume of $(37) million, under absorption from lower volume, unfavorable mix, higher commodity costs of ($107) million, primarily steel, and increased freight costs were partially mitigated by favorable productivity and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating profit was also impacted by the sale of our Russia business of $(40) million. Operating margin decreased 100 basis points.

Table of Contents
2021 Compared with 2020

The organic sales increase of 15.8% was driven by mid-teens growth in the Americas, high teens growth in Asia and high single digit growth in EMEA.

New Equipment operating profit increased $141 million, primarily due to higher volume of $140 million, with an operating margin increase of 120 basis points. Favorable field installation and material productivity was partially offset by unfavorable price and mix and commodity headwinds. Foreign currency tailwinds of $30 million were more than offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs of $40 million.

Service

The Service segment performs maintenance and repair services for both our products and those of other manufacturers and provides modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Maintenance services include inspections to ensure code compliance, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs, as well as repair services that address equipment and component wear and tear, and breakdowns. Modernization services enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics, to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our typical Service customers include building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed.

Operating profit

Service operating profit increased $27 million due to higher volume of $144 million, favorable pricing on maintenance contracts, productivity and other employment related cost reductions, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds of $(143) million, annual wage increases and other inflationary pressures, including higher fuel costs. Operating margin increased 50 basis points.

2021 Compared with 2020

Net Sales

The organic sales increase of 4.1% is due to organic sales increases in maintenance and repair of 4.4%, and modernization of 2.5%.

Operating Profit

Service operating profit increased $151 million, primarily due to higher volume of $120 million, with an operating margin increase of 60 basis points. Favorable pricing and mix and lower bad debt expense were partially offset by the absence of the benefit from prior year field actions taken in response to COVID-19. Foreign exchange tailwinds of $35 million and lower restructuring expense of $15 million were more than offset by higher selling general and administrative costs of $60 million, including the impact from cost containment actions taken in the prior year.

Table of Contents
General corporate expenses and other decreased $(177) million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the absence of a fixed asset impairment of $(71) million and related licensing costs of $(14) million recognized in 2020, as well as lower non-recurring Separation costs and the absence of UTC allocations of $(108) million.

1    Our total debt to total capitalization ratio and net debt to net capitalization ratio increased in 2022 due to the $1.5 billion reduction in equity as a result of the Tender Offer. For more information on the impact of the Zardoya Otis noncontrolling interest reclassification, see "Note 1: Business Overview" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately 98% was held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost-effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions and divestitures or other legal obligations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of such restricted cash was approximately $6 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, including cash held in escrow to fund the Tender Offer as of December 31, 2021. For information on the results of the Tender Offer and use of the cash held in escrow for the Tender Offer, see "Note 1: Business Overview" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

From time-to-time we may need to access the capital markets to obtain financing. We may incur indebtedness or issue equity as needed. Although we believe that the arrangements in place as of December 31, 2022 permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future could be impacted by many factors, including (1) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (2) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (3) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.

There was no long-term debt issued in 2022. The following is a summary of the long-term debt issuances in 2021:

November 12, 2021 0.934% notes due 2031 (€500 million principal value) 572
March 11, 2021 0.37% notes due 2026 (¥21,500 million principal value) 199

The proceeds from the March 2021 issuance of Japanese Yen notes listed above were used to repay a portion of our outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper. The proceeds from the November 2021 issuance of the Euro notes listed above were used to fund the Tender Offer in 2022.

The Company redeemed the $500 million floating notes originally due in 2023 during 2022. There was no long-term debt repayments in 2021. For additional discussion of borrowings, see "Note: Borrowings and Lines of Credit" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, we will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings.

We expect to fund our ongoing operating, investing and financing requirements mainly through cash flows from operations, available liquidity through cash on hand and available bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets.

On December 1, 2022, our Board of Directors revoked any remaining share repurchase authority under the prior share repurchase program and approved a new share repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion of Common Stock, of which none had been utilized as of December 31, 2022. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs or under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Cash Flow — Operating Activities

Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,560 $ 1,750 $ 1,480

2022 Compared with 2021

Cash generated from operating activities in 2022 was $190 million lower than in 2021, primarily due to lower cash flow related to current assets and current liabilities activity of $256 million, as described below. These were partially offset by $66 million of higher non-cash adjustments from Net income and $48 million of higher Other operating activities, net, primarily due to long-term accruals and other activities in 2022.

2022 Changes in Working Capital

Cash outflows related to current assets and current liabilities operating activity were $96 million, including the following main drivers:

•Accounts receivable, net, which increased by $309 million, due to the increased volume and timing of billings;

•Accrued liabilities, which decreased by $84 million, primarily due to the timing of payments of income taxes, employee-related benefits and other accruals; and

•Inventories, which increased by $65 million, primarily to support backlog conversion and to mitigate supply chain disruptions, which were partially offset by

•Accounts payable, which increased by $272 million, primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers; and

•Contract assets, current and Contract liabilities, current, net change of $38 million, driven by the timing of billings on contracts compared to the progression on current contracts.

2021 Compared with 2020

Cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $270 million higher than in 2020, primarily due to higher net income of $364 million and increased cash inflows related to current assets and current liabilities of $83 million, as described below. These were partially offset by $98 million of lower non-cash adjustments from Net income, including the absence of fixed asset impairments of $71 million in 2020, as well as $106 million of lower Other operating activities, net, primarily due to long-term accruals in 2020.

Guaranteed Securities: Summarized Financial Information

The following information is provided in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the 2023 Euro Notes, the 2026 Euro Notes and the 2031 Euro Notes (together the "Euro Notes"), in each case issued by Highland Holdings S.à r.l. (“Highland”), a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("Luxembourg"). The Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Otis Worldwide Corporation ("OWC") on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis. Refer to "Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information.

Highland is a wholly-owned, indirect consolidated subsidiary of OWC. OWC is incorporated under the laws of Delaware. As a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg, and with its registered office in Luxembourg, Highland is subject to Luxembourg insolvency and bankruptcy laws in the event any insolvency proceedings are initiated against it. Luxembourg bankruptcy law is significantly different from, and may be less favorable to creditors than, the bankruptcy law in effect in the United States and may make it more difficult for creditors to recover the amount they could expect to recover in liquidation under U.S. insolvency and bankruptcy rules.

The Euro Notes are not guaranteed by any of OWC's or Highland's subsidiaries (all OWC subsidiaries other than Highland are referred to herein as "non-guarantor subsidiaries"). Holders of the Euro Notes will have a direct claim only against Highland, as issuer, and OWC, as guarantor.

The following tables set forth the summarized financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of each of OWC and Highland on a standalone basis, which does not include the consolidated impact of the assets, liabilities, and financial results of their subsidiaries except as noted on the tables below, nor does it include any impact of intercompany eliminations as there were no intercompany transactions between OWC and Highland. This summarized financial information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of OWC or Highland in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. "Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates.

Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers

We recognized revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and its related amendments, (referred to, collectively, as "ASC 606”). For new equipment and modernization contracts, equipment and installation are typically procured in a single contract providing the customer with a complete installed elevator or escalator unit. The combination of equipment and installation promises are typically a single performance obligation. For these performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Contract costs are usually incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. Contract costs included in the calculation are comprised of labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs or other direct costs and indirect costs, which include indirect labor costs.

The long-term nature of the contracts, the complexity of the products and the scale of the projects can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely. We review cost estimates on significant new equipment and modernization contracts on a quarterly basis and, for others, no less frequently than annually or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. We record changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catch-up method and we review changes in contract estimates for their impact on net sales or operating profit in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Modifications are recognized as a cumulative catch-up or treated as a separate accounting contract if the modification adds distinct goods or services and the modification is priced at its stand-alone selling price.

See "Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

Income Taxes

The future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was $588 million as of December 31, 2022 and $647 million as of December 31, 2021. Management estimates that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be generally sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See "Note 3: Earnings Per Share" and "Note 15: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion. Additionally, see "Note 22: Contingent Liabilities" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for discussion of administrative review proceedings with the German Tax Office.

Goodwill

We have generated goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. At the time of acquisition, we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

We review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at July 1 or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Company referred to as the reporting unit, which is one level below the operating segment level. We have determined there are three reporting units within each business segment.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, we initially perform a qualitative assessment (commonly known as “step zero”) to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the two-step test. The qualitative assessment requires judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity’s operating environment, its industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If management concludes, based on assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying value, no further impairment testing is required. If we determine, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.

We completed the annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units as of July 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value of each reporting unit.

Contingent Liabilities

Otis is party to litigation related to a number of matters as described in "Note 22: Contingent Liabilities" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K. In particular, they may include risks associated with contractual, regulatory and other matters, which may arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and accrues for contingent losses that are probable and reasonably estimable. To assess the exposure to potential liability, we consult with relevant internal and external counsel. In making the decision regarding the need for loss accruals, management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. See Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for further discussion.

Employee Benefit Plans

We sponsor domestic and international defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and mortality rates. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of December 31. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, as of December 31, 2022:

---------------------------- ----------------------------------- ---- ----------------------------------- - --
(dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps

Projected benefit obligation $ (18) $ 20

The impact on the net periodic pension (benefit) cost, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic postretirement (benefit) cost is each less than $1 million.

Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have decreased or increased 2022 pension expense by approximately $2 million.

The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension liabilities and costs utilize each plan’s specific cash flows and are then compared to high-quality bond indices for reasonableness. Global market interest rates increased in 2022 as compared with 2021, and, as a result, the weighted-average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities was 3.8% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2021.

See "Note 13: Employee Benefit Plans" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of our business. We also have obligations arising from environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. Circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in the underlying transaction, non-performance under a contract or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party.

Otis' contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022 are discussed below. See also "Note 13: Employee Benefit Plans" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our expected pension and postretirement contributions.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations include amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders. Where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our long-term purchase agreements, we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what may be legally enforceable. We enter into contractual purchase commitments with suppliers and service vendors to support our information technology that are either necessary to operate our business or result from implementing strategic initiatives. In the following table, we show the timing of payments of total purchase obligations as of December 31, 2022:

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We are the world’s leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Our Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service. Through our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We sell our New Equipment directly to customers, as well as through agents and distributors.

Through our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services for both our own products and those of other manufacturers and provide modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Maintenance services include inspections to ensure code compliance, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs, as well as repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear and breakdowns. Modernization services enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our typical Service customers include building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed.

We function under a centralized operating model whereby we pursue a global strategy set around New Equipment and Service, in large measure, because we seek to grow our maintenance portfolio, in part, through the conversion of new elevator and escalator installations into service contracts. Accordingly, we benefit from an integrated global strategy, which sets priorities and establishes accountability across the full product lifecycle.

For additional discussion of our business, refer to Item 1 in this Form 10-K.

Sale of Russia business and risks associated with ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatile commodity markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents, reputational risk, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia).

To the extent possible, we continue to operate our business in Ukraine, which represented less than 1% of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 revenue and operating profit.

As previously disclosed, we stopped taking new equipment orders in Russia and making new investments in the country in March 2022, while reassessing our operations in the country, which represented approximately 1% and 2% of both our revenue and operating profit in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The operations were comprised mostly of New Equipment. In June 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our business in Russia to a third party, resulting in classification of the business']:

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.

Interest Expense (Income), Net

------------------------------ ---- --- ---- - ---- - ---
(dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020

Interest expense (income), net $ 143 $ 136 $ 122

Interest expense (income), net primarily relates to interest expense on our external debt, offset by interest income earned on cash balances and short-term investments.

The increase in Interest expense (income), net of $7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by interest expense related to the financing of the Tender Offer for Zardoya Otis.

The increase in Interest expense (income), net of $14 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by interest expense on the external debt associated with the Separation, which was not outstanding for the full year of 2020, as well as and debt repayments during 2021.

Income Taxes

The future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was $588 million as of December 31, 2022 and $647 million as of December 31, 2021. Management estimates that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be generally sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See "]:

Goodwill

We have generated goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. At the time of acquisition, we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

We review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at July 1 or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Company referred to as the reporting unit, which is one level below the operating segment level. We have determined there are three reporting units within each business segment.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, we initially perform a qualitative assessment (commonly known as “step zero”) to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the two-step test. The qualitative assessment requires judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity’s operating environment, its industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If management concludes, based on assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying value, no further impairment testing is required. If we determine, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.

We completed the annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units as of July 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value of each reporting unit.

Contingent Liabilities

Otis is party to litigation related to a number of matters as described in "]:
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 29

[" in Item 8 in this Form 10-K. In particular, they may include risks associated with contractual, regulatory and other matters, which may arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and accrues for contingent losses that are probable and reasonably estimable. To assess the exposure to potential liability, we consult with relevant internal and external counsel. In making the decision regarding the need for loss accruals, management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. See Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for further discussion.

Employee Benefit Plans

We sponsor domestic and international defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and mortality rates. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of December 31. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, as of December 31, 2022:

---------------------------- ----------------------------------- ---- ----------------------------------- - --
(dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps

Projected benefit obligation $ (18) $ 20

The impact on the net periodic pension (benefit) cost, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic postretirement (benefit) cost is each less than $1 million.

Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have decreased or increased 2022 pension expense by approximately $2 million.

The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension liabilities and costs utilize each plan’s specific cash flows and are then compared to high-quality bond indices for reasonableness. Global market interest rates increased in 2022 as compared with 2021, and, as a result, the weighted-average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities was 3.8% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2021.
