Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net), asserting claims under the Securities Exchange Act based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions concerning the time for completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. We will vigorously defend against this pending suit. We believe any potential recovery by the plaintiffs, in excess of applicable deductibles, will be covered by insurance, and we do not believe that the eventual outcome of this suit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
WMI’s charter and bylaws provide that WMI shall indemnify against all liabilities and expenses, and upon request shall advance expenses to any person, who is subject to a pending or threatened proceeding because such person is or was a director or officer of the Company. Such indemnification is required to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law. Accordingly, the director or officer must execute an undertaking to reimburse the Company for any fees advanced if it is later determined that the director or officer was not permitted to have such fees advanced under Delaware law. Additionally, the Company has direct contractual obligations to provide indemnification to each of the members of WMI’s Board of Directors and each of WMI’s executive officers. The Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification obligations in connection with actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or current officers, directors and employees.
Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans — About 20% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements with various local unions across the U.S. and Canada. As a result of some of these agreements, certain of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of Multiemployer Pension Plans for the covered employees. Refer to Note 9 for additional information about our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans considered individually significant. In connection with our ongoing renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these Multiemployer Pension Plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan may also occur if employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. Any other circumstance resulting in a decline in Company contributions to a Multiemployer Pension Plan through a reduction in the labor force, whether through attrition over time or through a business event (such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations) may also trigger a complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans.
We do not believe that any future liability relating to our past or current participation in, or withdrawals from, the Multiemployer Pension Plans to which we contribute will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or liquidity. However, liability for future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn and the financial condition of the Multiemployer Pension Plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).
Tax Matters — We maintain a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year towards resolving any material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. Any unresolved issues as of the tax return filing date are subject to routine examination procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received a notice of tax due for the 2017 tax year related to a remaining disagreement with the IRS. In response to the notice, the Company made a deposit of approximately $103 million with the IRS. The Company expects to seek a refund of the entire amount deposited with the IRS and litigate any denial of the claim for refund. As of December 31, 2022, the IRS deposit, net of reserve for uncertain tax positions, is classified as a component of other long-term assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Asset Impairments and Unusual Items 11. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, NetThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ 2022 2021 2020
Gain from divestitures, net ​ $ (5) ​ $ (44) ​ $ (33)
Asset impairments ​ 50 ​ 8 ​ 68
Other ​ 17 ​ 20 ​ —
​ ​ $ 62 ​ $ (16) ​ $ 35

​
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $62 million of net charges consisting of (i) $50 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to management’s decision to close two landfills within our East Tier segment and (ii) a $17 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment to adjust an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10. These losses were partially offset by a $5 million gain from the divestiture of a solid waste business in our West Tier segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net gains of $16 million primarily consisting of (i) a $35 million pre-tax gain from the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments on the divestiture of certain non-strategic Canadian operations in our East Tier segment and (ii) an $8 million gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our Other segment. These gains were partially offset by (i) a $20 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment and (ii) $8 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to our WM Renewable Energy business within our Other segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $35 million of net charges primarily related to (i) a $33 million net gain associated with net asset divestitures executed to address requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, primarily within our West Tier segment; (ii) $41 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to two landfills and an oil field waste injection facility in our West Tier segment; (iii) a $20 million non-cash impairment charge in our East Tier segment due to management’s decision to close a landfill once its constructed airspace is filled and abandon any remaining permitted airspace and (iv) $7 million of net charges primarily related to non-cash impairments of certain assets within our WM Renewable Energy business in our Other segment.
See Note 2 for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. See Note 19 for additional information related to the impact of impairments on the results of operations of our reportable segments.
Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $7 million related to an investment in a refined coal facility which is discussed further in Note 8. The fair value of our investment was not readily determinable; thus, we determined the fair value using management assumptions pertaining to investment value (Level 3 inputs). The remaining losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. Refer to Notes 8 and 18 for additional information related to these investments.

Capital Stock, Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program
Capital Stock, Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program 13. Capital Stock, Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase ProgramCapital StockWe have 1.5 billion shares of authorized common stock with a par value of $0.01 per common share. As of December 31, 2022, we had 407.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights (including voting, dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and limitations. We have 10 million shares of authorized preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is currently outstanding.DividendsOur quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $1,077 million in 2022, or $2.60 per common share, $970 million in 2021, or $2.30 per common share, and $927 million in 2020, or $2.18 per common share.In December 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.65 to $0.70 per share for dividends declared in 2023. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.Common Stock Repurchase ProgramThe Company repurchases shares of its common stock as part of capital allocation programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Share repurchases during the reported periods were completed through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements and, to a lesser extent, open market transactions. The terms of these ASR agreements required that we deliver cash at the beginning of each ASR repurchase period. In exchange, we received a portion of the total shares expected to be repurchased based on the then-current market price of our common stock. The remaining shares repurchased over the course of each repurchase period are delivered to us once the repurchase period is complete. In the table below, shares repurchased are measured and reported based on the period shares are delivered to us, which can differ from the period cash is delivered to a repurchase agent for the value of such shares. The following is a summary of our share repurchases under our common stock repurchase program for the year ended December 31:​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ 2022(a) 2021(b) 2020(c)
Shares repurchased (in thousands) ​ 9,796 ​ 8,731 ​ 3,687
Weighted average price per share $ 160.26 ​ $ 146.61 ​ $ 108.92
Total repurchases (in millions) ​ $ 1,570 ​ $ 1,280 ​ $ 402

(a) We executed and completed four ASR agreements during 2022 to repurchase $1.417 billion of our common stock and received 8.8 million shares in connection with these ASR agreements. We also repurchased an additional 0.6 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) for $83 million, inclusive of per-share commissions. Shares repurchased in 2022 include 0.4 million shares of our common stock for $70 million pursuant to our December 2021 ASR agreement that completed in January 2022.

(b) We executed and completed three ASR agreements during 2021 to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock and received 7.0 million shares in connection with these ASR agreements. Additionally, in December 2021, we executed

an ASR agreement to repurchase $350 million of our common stock. At the beginning of the repurchase period, we delivered $350 million in cash and received 1.7 million shares based on a stock price of $160.67. The ASR agreement completed in January 2022, at which time we received 0.4 million additional shares based on a final weighted average price of $160.33.

(c) During 2020, we executed and completed an ASR agreement to repurchase $313 million of our common stock and received 2.8 million shares in connection with this ASR agreement. We also repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act for $89 million, inclusive of per-share commissions.

We announced in December 2022 that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.5 billion in future share repurchases. This new authorization replaces our prior $1.5 billion authorization that was fully utilized in 2022. Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on factors similar to those considered by the Board of Directors in making dividend declarations, including our net earnings, financial condition and cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions.

Equity-Based Compensation
Equity-Based Compensation 14. Equity-Based CompensationEmployee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which employees that have been employed for at least 30 days may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for two offering periods for purchases: January through June and July through December. At the end of each offering period, enrolled employees purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the market value of the stock on the first and last day of such offering period. The purchases are made at the end of an offering period with funds accumulated through payroll deductions over the course of the offering period. Subject to limitations set forth in the plan and under IRS regulations, eligible employees may elect to have up to 10% of their base pay deducted during the offering period. The total number of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 455,000, 513,000 and 570,000, respectively. After the January 2023 issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2022 offering period, 2.3 million shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.As a result of our ESPP, annual compensation expense increased by $13 million, or $10 million net of tax expense, for 2022, $12 million, or $9 million net of tax expense, for 2021 and $13 million, or $10 million net of tax expense, for 2020.Employee Stock Incentive PlansIn May 2014, our stockholders approved our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) to replace our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). The 2014 Plan authorized 23.8 million shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan, plus the approximately 1.1 million shares that then remained available for issuance under the 2009 Plan, and any shares subject to outstanding awards under both incentive plans that are subsequently cancelled, forfeited, terminate, expire or lapse. In May 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the 2014 Plan to provide that the number of future shares surrendered in payment of the exercise or purchase price of an award, and the number of future shares used to satisfy the withholding obligations, shall no longer be credited back to the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 16.1 million shares were available for future grants under the 2014 Plan. All of our equity-based compensation awards described herein have been made pursuant to either our 2009 Plan or our 2014 Plan, collectively referred to as the “Incentive Plans.” We currently utilize treasury shares to meet the needs of our equity-based compensation programs.Pursuant to the Incentive Plans, we have the ability to issue stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share units (“PSUs”). The terms and conditions of equity awards granted under the Incentive Plans are determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.The 2022 annual incentive plan awards granted to the Company’s senior leadership team, which generally includes the Company’s executive officers, included a combination of PSUs and stock options. Additionally, several members of the Company’s senior leadership team received a grant of RSUs in 2022 in special recognition of leadership and contributions critical to the acquisition of Advanced Disposal and the subsequent integration and synergy generation. Awards granted to other eligible employees under the 2014 Plan included a combination of PSUs, RSUs and stock options in 2022. The Company also periodically grants RSUs to employees working on key initiatives, in connection with new hires and promotions and to field-based managers.Restricted Stock Units — A summary of our RSUs is presented in the table below (units in thousands):​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted Average
​ ​ ​ ​ Per Share
​ Units Fair Value
Unvested as of January 1, 2022 343 ​ $ 114.28
Granted 162 ​ $ 147.74
Vested (107) ​ $ 100.11
Forfeited (33) ​ $ 136.43
Unvested as of December 31, 2022 365 ​ $ 131.26

​
The total fair market value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $15 million, $12 million and $14 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued approximately 77,000 shares of common stock for these vested RSUs, net of approximately 30,000 units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes.
RSUs may not be voted or sold by award recipients until time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed. RSUs primarily provide for three-year cliff vesting and include dividend equivalents accumulated during the vesting period. Unvested units are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination. RSUs are generally subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s involuntary termination other than for cause and generally payout at the end of the three-year vesting period and become immediately vested in the event of an employee’s death or disability.
Compensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required employment period. Beginning in 2021, the terms of the award agreements for new grants of RSUs were updated to provide for accelerated vesting following retirement as if the employee had remained employed until the end of the vesting period. Accordingly, compensation expense for RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees is recognized over the longer of (i) the period between grant date and the date that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible or (ii) the defined service requirement of the award. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of expected forfeitures.
Performance Share Units — Two types of PSUs are currently outstanding: (i) PSUs for which payout is dependent on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index (“TSR PSUs”) and (ii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against pre-established adjusted cash flow metrics (“Cash Flow PSUs”). Both types of PSUs are payable in shares of common stock after the end of a three-year performance period, when the Company’s financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in the first half of the first quarter of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the
targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. A summary of our PSUs, at 100% of the targeted amount, is presented in the table below (units in thousands):
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
-------------------------------- - ----- - ---------------- ------
​ ​ Weighted Average
​ ​ ​ ​ Per Share
​ Units Fair Value
Unvested as of January 1, 2022 968 ​ $ 129.60
Granted 290 ​ $ 168.49
Vested (346) ​ $ 116.26
Forfeited (48) ​ $ 147.79
Unvested as of December 31, 2022 864 ​ $ 147.00

​
The determination of achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting of PSUs for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022 was performed by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors in January 2023. Accordingly, vesting information for such awards is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2022. The “vested” PSUs are for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2021, as achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting was determined in February 2022. The performance of the Company’s common stock for purposes of the TSR PSUs exceeded target performance criteria, and the Company’s financial results, as measured for purposes of the Cash Flow PSUs, exceeded the maximum performance criteria. Accordingly, recipients of the PSU awards received a payout of 167.78% of the vested TSR PSUs and 200% of the vested Cash Flow PSUs. In February 2022, approximately 637,000 PSUs vested and we issued approximately 420,000 shares of common stock for these vested PSUs, net of units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes. The shares of common stock that were issued or deferred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 for prior PSU award grants had a fair market value of $91 million, $74 million and $89 million, respectively.
PSUs have no voting rights. PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash based on the number of shares that vest at the end of the awards’ performance period. Subject to attainment of the performance metrics described above, PSUs are payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period. PSUs are generally subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s involuntary termination other than for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination. The terms of the award agreements for outstanding PSUs provide for continued vesting following retirement as if the employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period, and compensation expense for PSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated over the period that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible plus a defined service requirement.
Compensation expense associated with our Cash Flow PSUs is based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of both the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and expected forfeitures. The grant-date fair value of our TSR PSUs is based on a Monte Carlo valuation and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized for all TSR PSUs whether or not the market conditions are achieved less expected forfeitures.
Deferred Units — Certain employees can elect to defer some or all of the vested RSU or PSU awards until a specified date or dates they choose. Deferred units are not invested, nor do they earn interest, but deferred amounts do receive dividend equivalents paid in cash during deferral at the same time and at the same rate as dividends on the Company’s common stock. Deferred amounts are paid out in shares of common stock at the end of the deferral period. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 179,000 vested deferred units outstanding.
Stock Options — Stock options granted prior to 2021 vest in 25% increments on the first two anniversaries of the date of grant with the remaining 50% vesting on the third anniversary. Beginning in 2021, stock options granted vest ratably in three annual increments, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price of the options is the average of the high and low market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and the options have a term of 10 years. A summary of our stock options is presented in the table below (options in thousands):
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
--------------------------------------- - ------- - ---------------- ------
​ ​ Weighted Average
​ ​ ​ ​ Per Share
​ Options Exercise Price
Outstanding as of January 1, 2022 3,206 ​ $ 92.53
Granted 477 ​ $ 145.67

Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 (c) 1,762 ​ $ 83.34

(a) Includes approximately 141,000 stock options exercised pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that provided for net share settlement, resulting in the Company withholding approximately 112,000 shares of our common stock to cover the associated stock option exercise price and taxes.

(b) Stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 have a weighted average remaining contractual term of 6.2 years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $163 million based on the market value of our common stock on December 31, 2022.

(c) Stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2022 have an aggregate intrinsic value of $130 million based on the market value of our common stock on December 31, 2022.

During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received cash proceeds of $44 million, $66 million and $63 million, respectively, from the exercise of 675,000, 962,000 and 1,039,000 of employee stock options. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $51 million, $66 million and $58 million, respectively.
Stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (options in thousands):
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
------------------------ - ------- - ---------------- ------ ---------------- ---
​ ​ Weighted Average ​
​ ​ ​ ​ Per Share ​ Weighted Average
Range of Exercise Prices Options Exercise Price Remaining Years
 $36.88-$50.00 166 ​ $ 40.31 1.0
 $50.01-$70.00 355 ​ $ 55.53 2.7
 $70.01-$100.00 888 ​ $ 87.95 5.3
 $100.01-$145.67 353 ​ $ 119.87 7.6
 $36.88-$145.67 1,762 ​ $ 83.34 5.0

​
All unvested stock options shall become exercisable upon the award recipient’s death or disability. In the event of a recipient’s retirement, stock options shall continue to vest pursuant to the original schedule set forth in the award agreement. If the recipient is terminated by the Company without cause or voluntarily resigns, the recipient shall be entitled to exercise all stock options outstanding and exercisable within a specified time frame after such termination. All outstanding stock options, whether exercisable or not, are forfeited upon termination for cause.
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $26.44, $17.25 and $15.82, respectively. The fair value of stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period less expected forfeitures, except
for stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees, for which expense is accelerated over the period that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to value employee stock options granted during the year ended December 31 under the Black-Scholes valuation model:
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
----------------------- - ---- ----- ---- ---- ----- - ---- -----
​ 2022 2021 2020
Expected option life 4.7 years 4.7 years 4.6 years
Expected volatility 23.4 % 23.2 % 16.6 %
Expected dividend yield 1.8 % 2.1 % 1.7 %
Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.6 % 1.4 %

​
The Company bases its expected option life on the expected exercise and termination behavior of its optionees and an appropriate model of the Company’s future stock price. The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options, combined with other relevant factors including implied volatility in market-traded options on the Company’s stock. The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option as of the grant date.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $71 million, $94 million and $79 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes related income tax benefits of $14 million, $18 million and $15 million, respectively. We have not capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the reported periods.
As of December 31, 2022, we estimate that $45 million of currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years for our unvested RSU, PSU and stock option awards issued and outstanding.
Non-Employee Director Plan
Our non-employee directors currently receive annual grants of shares of our common stock, generally payable in two equal installments, under the 2014 Plan described above.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value Measurements 16. Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair ValueFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 — Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following as of December 31 (in millions):​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ 2022 2021
Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Cash equivalents and money market funds $ 240 $ 38
Equity securities ​ ​ 37 ​ ​ 25
Significant other observable inputs (Level 2): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Available-for-sale securities ​ 360 ​ ​ 395
Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Redeemable preferred stock ​ 56 ​ 49
Total Assets $ 693 ​ $ 507

​
See Note 11 for information related to our nonrecurring fair value measurements and the impact of impairments. See Note 17 for information related to the nonrecurring fair value measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with our acquisitions.
Cash Equivalents and Money Market Funds
Cash equivalents primarily include short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less. We invest portions of our restricted trust funds in money market funds and we measure the fair value of these investments using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of our cash equivalents and money market funds approximates our cost basis in these instruments.
Equity Securities
We invest portions of our restricted trust funds in equity securities and we measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Any changes in fair value of these securities related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of other income (expense).
Available-for-Sale Securities
Our available-for-sale securities include restricted trust funds and an investment in an unconsolidated entity, as discussed in Note 18. We invest primarily in debt securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which generally mature over the next nine years. We measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets. Any changes in fair value of these trusts related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Redeemable preferred stock is related to a noncontrolling investment in an unconsolidated entity and is included in investments in unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of our investment has been measured based on third-party investors’ recent or pending transactions in these securities, which are considered the best evidence of fair value. When this evidence is not available, we use other valuation techniques as appropriate and available. These valuation methodologies may include transactions in similar instruments, discounted cash flow techniques, third-party appraisals or industry multiples and public company comparable transactions.
Fair Value of Debt
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our debt was $15.0 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $13.8 billion and $14.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the fair value of debt is primarily related to increases in current market rates of our senior notes, the impacts of which were substantially offset by net borrowings of $1.4 billion during 2022.
Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy available as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions and Divestitures 17. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions2022 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired 13 businesses, including the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business intended to allow us to deliver new recycling capabilities for our customers and provide circular solutions for film and clear plastic wrap used commercially, such as plastic stretch wrap for pallets, furniture film, grocery bags and potentially shrink wrap around food and beverage containers. Our other acquisitions in 2022 primarily related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $507 million, which included $372 million in net cash paid and $135 million in non-cash consideration, primarily related to purchase price holdbacks and the conversion of $67 million in secured convertible promissory notes receivable into equity of the acquired business. In addition, we paid $5 million of holdbacks related to prior year acquisitions.Total consideration for our 2022 acquisitions was primarily allocated to $138 million of property and equipment, $64 million of other intangible assets, $325 million of goodwill and $14 million of noncontrolling interests. Other intangible assets included $45 million of customer relationships and $19 million of covenants not-to-compete. We remain in the measurement period for most of our 2022 acquisitions, and further adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocations may occur, specifically for the valuation of certain acquired intangibles. The goodwill related to our 2022 acquisitions was primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations, of which less than half was tax deductible.2021 AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired 11 businesses primarily related to our Solid Waste business. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $94 million, which included $73 million in net cash paid and $21 million of other consideration, primarily purchase price holdbacks and the settlement of a preexisting promissory note with one of the acquired businesses. In addition, we paid $3 million of holdbacks, primarily related to current year acquisitions. Our 2021 acquisitions discussed above include our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in a waste diversion technology company. Concurrent with our acquisition, the acquired entity issued shares to an unrelated third-party, diluting our ownership interest. We determined the entity constituted a variable interest entity and concluded that we did not have the power to direct its significant activities. As a result, we subsequently deconsolidated the entity and account for our remaining ownership interest as an equity method investment.2020 AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired four businesses related to our Solid Waste business, including the acquisition of Advanced Disposal discussed further below. Total consideration, net of cash acquired of $36 million, for all acquisitions was $4.1 billion, none of which related to other consideration such as purchase price holdbacks. In 2020, we paid $3 million of holdbacks, all of which related to prior year acquisitions. Contingent consideration obligations are primarily based on achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, which generally include targeted financial metrics.Advanced Disposal — On October 30, 2020, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of Advanced Disposal for $30.30 per share in cash, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 14, 2019, as amended on June 24, 2020. Total enterprise value of the acquisition was $4.6 billion when including approximately $1.8 billion of Advanced Disposal’s net debt. This acquisition grew our footprint and allows us to provide differentiated, sustainable waste management and recycling services to approximately three million new commercial, industrial and residential customers, primarily located in the Eastern half of the U.S. The acquisition was funded using a $3.0 billion, 364-day, U.S. revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program. In November 2020, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings under the $3.0 billion, 364-day, U.S. revolver and terminated the facility. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred integration related costs of $10 million and $51 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred acquisition and integration related costs of $156 million, which were primarily classified as “Selling, general and administrative expenses.” The post-closing operating results of Advanced Disposal have been included in our consolidated financial statements, within our existing reportable segments. Post-closing through December 31, 2020, Advanced Disposal recognized $205 million, $142 million and $60 million of revenue, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.Our consolidated financial statements have not been retroactively restated to include Advanced Disposal’s historical financial position or results of operations. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. The Company valued the customer relationship asset using an income approach; specifically, the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used to value customer relationships included, among others, attrition rates, revenue growth rate, and discount rate. The Company valued the landfill assets using an income approach; specifically, the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used to value landfill assets included, among others, the forecasted revenue and revenue growth (including forecasted waste volumes and rate per ton), discount rate, and forecasted capital expenditures. The allocation of the purchase price was finalized in October 2021.Goodwill of $2.5 billion was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units that have integrated these operations as they are benefitting from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.The following table shows the purchase price allocation as of the date acquired, and adjustments to October 30, 2021 (in millions):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

(a) In connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, we and Advanced Disposal entered into an agreement that provided for GFL Environmental to acquire a combination of assets from us and Advanced Disposal to address divestitures required by the U.S. Department of Justice. Upon acquisition these assets met the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and were classified as held for sale and included within the “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities held for sale” line items in the above final allocation of purchase price. Immediately following the

acquisition, the divestiture transactions were consummated and the Company subsequently received cash proceeds from the sale of $856 million.

​
(b) At the time of acquisition, Advanced Disposal had outstanding $425 million of 5.625% senior notes due November 2024, the fair value of which was $438 million. In November 2020, we redeemed the notes pursuant to an optional redemption feature.

​
The final allocation of $601 million for other intangibles includes $572 million for customer relationships with an amortization period of 15 years and $29 million of other intangibles with a weighted average amortization period of seven years.
The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for the Company and Advanced Disposal as though the companies had been combined as of January 1, 2020. Examples of adjustments made to arrive at the pro forma amounts include, but are not limited to, the following:
•The effect of divestitures required by the U.S. Department of Justice;
•Intercompany true-ups based on acquisition/divestiture activity;
•Transaction expenses incurred by us and Advanced Disposal;
•Adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense due to step-up in fair value of the acquired assets; and
•Interest expense adjustments.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved as if the acquisition had taken place as of January 1, 2020 for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except per share amounts):

​
Divestitures
In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate sales price for divestitures of certain landfill assets, as well as collection, hauling, disposal and ancillary operations, was $6 million, $48 million and $856 million, and we recognized net gains of $5 million, $44 million and $33 million, respectively. In 2021, divestitures primarily related to the sale of certain non-strategic Canadian operations, as discussed in Note 11. In 2020, divestitures primarily consisted of assets required to be sold by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with our acquisition of Advanced Disposal, as discussed above. The remaining amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows generally relate to the sale of fixed assets.

Variable Interest Entities
Variable Interest Entities 18. Variable Interest EntitiesThe following is a description of our financial interests in unconsolidated and consolidated variable interest entities that we consider significant:Low-Income Housing Properties We do not consolidate our investments in entities established to manage low-income housing properties because we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities as we do not have the power to individually direct the activities of these entities. Accordingly, we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. Our aggregate investment balance in these entities was $321 million and $178 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The debt balance related to our investments in low-income housing properties was $295 million and $156 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additional information related to these investments is discussed in Note 8.Trust Funds for Final Capping, Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation ObligationsUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities — Trust funds that are established for both the benefit of the Company and the host community in which we operate are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities as (i) we do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trusts or (ii) power over the trusts’ significant activities is shared. Our interests in these trusts are accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are recorded in other receivables, investments in unconsolidated entities and long-term other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. We also reflect our share of the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities held by these trusts as a component of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investments and receivables related to these trusts had an aggregate carrying value of $93 million and $110 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Consolidated Variable Interest Entities — Trust funds for which we are the sole beneficiary are consolidated because we are the primary beneficiary. These trust funds are recorded in restricted funds in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities held by these trusts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These trusts had a fair value of $113 million and $117 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Segment and Related Information
Segment and Related Information 19. Segment and Related InformationOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our Solid Waste operations through two operating segments. Our East Tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the Eastern U.S., the Great Lakes region and substantially all of Canada. Our West Tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the Western U.S., including the upper Midwest region, and British Columbia, Canada. Each of our Solid Waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services, including collection, transfer, recycling, and disposal. The East and West Tiers are presented in this report and constitute our existing Solid Waste business. The operating segments not evaluated and overseen through our East and West Tiers are presented herein as “Other” as these operating segments do not meet the criteria to be aggregated with other operating segments and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported.Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments as of December 31 and for the year then ended is shown in the following table (in millions):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

(a) Income from operations provided by our Solid Waste business is generally indicative of the margins provided by our collection, landfill, transfer and recycling lines of business. From time to time, the operating results of our reportable segments are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that management believes are not indicative or representative of our results.

Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume. This increase was partially offset by (i) inflationary cost pressures; (ii) labor cost increases from frontline employee wage adjustments; (iii) divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, discussed in Note 11 above, that impacted our East Tier results and (iv) reduced profitability in our recycling business from the decline in recycling commodity prices and lower volumes.
Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume, as well as the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) improved profitability in our recycling business from higher market prices for recycling commodities and improved costs at facilities where we have made investments in enhanced technology and equipment and (iii) changes from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, discussed in Note 11, that impacted both Tiers’ results. These increases were partially offset by (i) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth; (ii) increased landfill depletion from higher volumes and revisions in landfill estimates, including the anticipated timing of capping, closure and post-closure activities at certain landfills and adjustments in 2020 to the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations that benefitted costs in 2020 and (iii) inflationary cost pressures. During 2021, the positive earnings contributions from Advanced Disposal were offset by elevated depreciation, depletion and amortization of acquired assets.
(b) “Other” includes (i) elements of our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) business that are not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (ii) elements of our sustainability business that includes landfill gas-to-energy operations managed by our WM Renewable Energy business, our SES business and recycling brokerage services and not included in the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions and (iv) the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.

The decrease in income from operations in 2022, as compared with 2021, was due to the recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs, as well as, a prior year gain from divestitures of certain ancillary operations in our Other segment, discussed in Note 11, partially offset by improved profitability in our SES and WMSBS businesses. The increase in income from operations for 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily driven by increased market values for renewable energy credits generated by our WM Renewable Energy business.
(c) “Corporate and other” operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to our reportable segments. These support services include, among other things, treasury, legal, digital, tax, insurance, centralized service center processes, other administrative functions and the maintenance of our closed landfills. Income from operations for “Corporate and Other” also includes costs associated with our long-term incentive program.

These costs increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to strategic investments in our digital platform and sustainability initiatives, partially offset by lower acquisition and integration related costs.
These costs increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) strategic investments in our digital platform; (iv) increased health and welfare costs attributable to medical care activity generally returning to pre-pandemic levels from the lower levels experienced during 2020 and (v) charges pertaining to reserves for certain loss contingencies during 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting, advisory and legal fees following the completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal in the fourth quarter of 2020 and changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in both 2020 and 2021.
(d) Intercompany operating revenues reflect each segment’s total intercompany sales, including intercompany sales within a segment and between segments. Transactions within and between segments are generally made on a basis intended to reflect the market value of the service.

(e) For those items included in the determination of income from operations, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

(f) Includes non-cash items. Capital expenditures are reported in our reportable segments at the time they are recorded within the segments’ property and equipment balances and, therefore, include timing differences for amounts accrued but not yet paid.

(g) The reconciliation of total assets reported above to total assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 is as follows (in millions):

(a) The “Other” line of business includes (i) certain services provided by our WMSBS business; (ii) certain services within our sustainability business including our landfill gas-to-energy operations managed by our WM Renewable Energy business and (iii) certain other expanded service offerings and solutions and reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity. Revenue attributable to collection, landfill, transfer and recycling services provided by our “Other” businesses has been reflected as a component of the relevant line of business for purposes of presentation in this table.

(b) Intercompany revenues between lines of business are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.

Fluctuations in our operating results may be caused by many factors, including period-to-period changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business, changes in commodity prices and general economic conditions. Our revenues and income from operations typically reflect seasonal patterns. Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.
Our 2020 operating results were negatively impacted by COVID-19, as volume declines began in March 2020 in our landfill, industrial and commercial collection businesses due to steps taken by national and local governments to slow the spread of the virus, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Throughout 2021 and 2022, our volumes recovered from the sharp decline experienced in 2020, with minimal impact from the resurgence in transmission of COVID-19 associated with recent virus variants, as communities and businesses remained open. However, the potential for future resurgence in transmission of COVID-19 and related business closures, due to virus variants or other pandemic conditions, could adversely impact our volumes and costs in the future.
Service or operational disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the geographic areas affected. Extreme weather events may also lead to supply chain disruption and delayed project development, or disruption of our customers’ businesses, reducing the amount of waste generated by their operations.
On the other hand, certain destructive weather and climate conditions, such as wildfires in the Western U.S. and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S. during the second half of the year, can increase our revenues in the geographic areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events. While weather-related and other event-driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, due to significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation The financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation; its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which Waste Management, Inc. or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries as described in Note 18. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.We are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions, providing services throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We partner with our residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our “Solid Waste” business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, including our Waste Management Renewable Energy (“WM Renewable Energy”) business, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S and Canada that produce renewable electricity and renewable natural gas, which is a significant source of fuel for our natural gas fleet.Our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our Solid Waste operations through two operating segments. Our East Tier primarily the upper Midwest region, and British Columbia, Canada. Each of our Solid Waste operating segments provides integrated environmental services, including collection, transfer, recycling, and disposal. The East and West Tiers are presented in this report and constitute our existing Solid Waste business. On October 30, 2020, we acquired Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (“Advanced Disposal”), the operations of which are presented in this report within our existing Solid Waste tiers. We also provide additional services that are not managed through our Solid Waste business, which are presented in this report as “Other.” Additional information related to our acquisition of Advanced Disposal and segments is included in Notes 17 and 19, respectively.
Reclassifications ReclassificationsWhen necessary, reclassifications have been made to our prior period financial information to conform to the current year presentation and are not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated entities are accounted for under the appropriate method of accounting.
Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and AssumptionsIn preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments held within restricted funds, and accounts receivable. We make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other financial interests with a diverse group of credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not have collateral requirements for credit extensions. We also control our exposure associated with trade receivables by discontinuing service, to the extent allowable, to non-paying customers. However, our overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number and diversity of customers we serve. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no single customer represented greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.
Accounts and Other Receivables Accounts and Other Receivables Our receivables, which are recorded when billed, when services are performed or when cash is advanced, are claims against third parties that will generally be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends; type of customer, such as municipal or commercial; the age of outstanding receivables and existing as well as expected economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes. We no longer accrue interest once the notes are deemed uncollectible.The following table reflects the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts of trade receivables for the year ended December 31 (in millions):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ 2022 2021
Balance as of January 1 ​ $ 25 ​ $ 33
Additions charged to expense ​ 55 ​ 35
Accounts written-off, net of recoveries ​ (49) ​ (36)
Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net ​ (5) ​ (7)
Balance as of December 31 ​ $ 26 ​ $ 25

​
To determine the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables, we rely upon, among other factors, historical loss trends, the age of outstanding receivables, and existing as well as expected economic conditions. We determined that all of our trade receivables share similar risk characteristics. We monitor our credit exposure on an ongoing basis and assess whether assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. Based on aging analysis as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 90% of our trade receivables were outstanding less than 60 days.
To determine the allowance for doubtful accounts for other receivables, as well as loans and other instruments, we rely primarily on credit ratings and associated default rates based on the maturity of the instrument. Other receivables, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, include receivables related to income tax payments in excess of our current income tax obligations of $150 million and $166 million, respectively. Other receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 also include a receivable of $19 million and $14 million, respectively, related to alternative fuel tax credits. Based on an aging analysis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 55% and 60%, respectively, of our other receivables were due within 12 months or less.

Parts and Supplies

Parts and Supplies
Parts and supplies consist primarily of spare parts, fuel, tires, lubricants and processed recycling materials. Our parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (using the average cost method) or market.

Landfill Accounting

Landfill Accounting
Cost Basis of Landfill Assets — We capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property); permitting; excavation; liner material and installation; landfill leachate collection systems; landfill gas collection systems; environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas; and directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes asset retirement costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These costs are discussed below.
Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs — Following is a description of our asset retirement activities and our related accounting:
● Final Capping — Generally involves the installation of flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed. Final capping asset retirement obligations are recorded on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with each final capping event.

● Closure — Includes the construction of the final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required), demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but

before the landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state regulatory agency. These costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities.

● Post-Closure — Involves the maintenance and monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to maintain and monitor landfill sites for a 30-year period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post-closure activities.

We develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value is based on the best available information, including the results of present value techniques. In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use historical experience, professional engineering judgment and quoted or actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component of operating income when the work is completed.
Once we have determined final capping, closure and post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we inflated these costs in current dollars to the expected time of payment using an inflation rate of 2.50%, 2.25% and 2.25%, respectively. We discounted these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred, consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the historical weighted average rate of the recorded obligation. As a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted average rate applicable to our long-term asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 4.8%.
We record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the airspace consumed through the current period. The fair value of final capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire landfill and the expected timing of each closure and post-closure activity. Because these obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities could result in a material change in these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts change.
Sustained changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities typically result in both (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset and (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over either the remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as defined below) of the related discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as appropriate. Any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our landfill depletion policy (previously landfill amortization policy), which would generally result in depletion expense being recognized prospectively over the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as appropriate. Changes in
such estimates a

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

Equity-Based Compensation
Equity-Based Compensation 14. Equity-Based CompensationEmployee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) set forth in the plan and under IRS regulations, eligible employees may elect to have up to 10% of their base pay deducted during the offering period. The total number of shares issued under the plan period, 2.3 million shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.As a result of our ESPP, annual compensation expense increased by $13 million, or $10 million net of tax expense, for 2022, $12 approximately 16.1 million shares were available for future grants under the 2014 Plan. All of our equity-based compensation awards described herein have been made pursuant to either our 2009 Plan or in connection with new hires and promotions and to field-based managers.Restricted Stock Units — A summary of our RSUs is presented in the table below (units in thousands):​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

Forfeited (33) ​ $ 136.43
Unvested as of December 31, 2022 365 ​ $ 131.26

​
The total fair market value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $15 million, $12 million and $14 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued approximately 77,000 shares of common stock for these vested RSUs, net of approximately 30,000 units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes.
RSUs may not be voted or sold payout at the end of the three-year vesting period and become immediately vested in the event of an employee’s death or disability.
Compensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required employment period. Beginning in 2021, the terms of the award agreements for new grants of RSUs were updated expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of expected forfeitures.
Performance Share Units — Two types of PSUs are currently outstanding: (i) PSUs for which payout is dependent on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index (“TSR PSUs”) and (ii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against pre-established entire performance period is reported, typically in the first half of the first quarter of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the
targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. A summary of our PSUs, at 100% of the targeted amount, is presented in the table below (units in thousands):

​
The determination of achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting of PSUs for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022 was performed by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors in January 2023. Accordingly, vesting information for such awards is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2022. The “vested” PSUs are for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2021, as achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting was determined in February 2022. The performance of the Company’s common stock for purposes of the TSR PSUs exceeded target performance criteria, and the Company’s financial results, vested Cash Flow PSUs. In February 2022, approximately 637,000 PSUs vested and we issued approximately 420,000 shares of common stock for these vested PSUs, net of units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes. The shares of common stock that were issued or deferred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 for prior PSU award grants had a fair market value of $91 million, $74 million and $89 million, respectively.
PSUs have no voting rights. PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash based on the number of shares that vest at the end of the awards’ performance period. Subject to attainment of the performance metrics described above, PSUs are payable to an employee (or his beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had remained employed until period, and compensation expense for PSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated over the period that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible plus a defined service requirement.
Compensation vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized for all TSR PSUs whether or not the market conditions are achieved less expected forfeitures.
Deferred Units — Certain employees can elect to defer some in cash during deferral at the same time and at the same rate as dividends on the Company’s common stock. Deferred amounts are paid out in shares of common stock at the end of the deferral period. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 179,000 vested deferred units outstanding.
Stock Options — Stock options granted prior to 2021 vest in 25% increments on the first two anniversaries of the date in the table below (options in thousands):

(b) Stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 have a weighted average remaining contractual term of 6.2 years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $163 million based on the market value of our common stock on December 31, 2022.

(c) Stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2022 have an aggregate intrinsic value of $130 million based on the market value of our common stock on December 31, 2022.

During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received cash proceeds of $44 million, $66 million and $63 million, respectively, from the exercise of 675,000, 962,000 and 1,039,000 of employee stock options. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $51 million, $66 million and $58 million, respectively.
Stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (options in thousands):

All unvested stock options shall become exercisable upon the award recipient’s death or disability. In the event of a recipient’s retirement, stock options shall continue to vest pursuant to the original schedule set forth in the award agreement. If the recipient is All outstanding stock options, whether exercisable or not, are forfeited upon termination for cause.
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $26.44, $17.25 and $15.82, respectively. The fair value of stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period less expected forfeitures, except
for stock options granted to retirement-eligible granted during the year ended December 31 under the Black-Scholes valuation model:
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
----------------------- - ---- ----- ---- ---- ----- - ---- -----
​ 2022 2021 2020
Expected option life 4.7 years 4.7 years 4.6 years
Expected volatility 23.4 % 23.2 % 16.6 %
Expected dividend yield 1.8 % 2.1 % 1.7 %
Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.6 % 1.4 %

​
The Company bases its expected option life on the expected exercise and termination behavior of its optionees and an appropriate model of the Company’s future stock price. The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility in market-traded options on the Company’s stock. The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option as of the grant date.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $71 million, $94 million and $79 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value Measurements 16. Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair ValueFair value is defined as the price that would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following as of December 31 (in millions):​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ 2022 2021
Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Cash equivalents and money market funds $ 240 $ 38
Equity securities ​ ​ 37 ​ ​ 25
Significant other observable inputs (Level 2): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Available-for-sale securities ​ 360 ​ ​ 395
Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Redeemable preferred stock ​ 56 ​ 49
Total Assets $ 693 ​ $ 507

​
See Note 11 for information related to our nonrecurring fair value measurements and the impact of impairments. See Note 17 for information related to the nonrecurring fair value measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with our acquisitions.
Cash Equivalents and Money Market Funds
Cash equivalents primarily include short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities The fair value of our cash equivalents and money market funds approximates our cost basis in these instruments.
Equity Securities
We invest portions of our restricted trust funds in equity securities and we measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Any changes in fair value of these securities related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of other income (expense).
Available-for-Sale Securities
Our available-for-sale securities include restricted trust funds and an investment in an unconsolidated related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Redeemable preferred stock is related comparable transactions.
Fair Value of Debt
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our debt was $15.0 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $13.8 billion and $14.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the fair value of debt is primarily related to increases in current market rates of our senior notes, the impacts of which were substantially offset by net borrowings of $1.4 billion during 2022.
Although we have determined the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and fair values. The fair value estimates are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy available as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.

(a) Income from operations provided by our Solid Waste business is generally indicative of the margins provided by our collection, landfill, transfer and recycling of our results.

Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume. This increase was partially offset by (i) inflationary cost pressures; (ii) labor cost increases from frontline employee wage adjustments; (iii) divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, discussed in Note 11 above, that impacted our East Tier results and (iv) reduced profitability in our recycling business from the decline in recycling commodity prices and lower volumes.
Income from operations in our Solid Waste business increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, primarily due to (i) revenue growth in our collection and disposal businesses driven by both yield and volume, as well as the acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (ii) improved profitability in our recycling business from higher market prices for recycling commodities and improved costs at facilities where we have made investments in enhanced technology and equipment and (iii) changes from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, discussed in Note 11, that impacted both Tiers’ results. These increases were partially offset by (i) labor cost pressure from frontline employee wage adjustments, increased turnover driving up training costs and higher overtime due to driver shortages and volume growth; (ii) increased to the inflation rate used to estimate capping, closure, and post-closure asset retirement obligations that benefitted costs in 2020 and (iii) inflationary cost pressures. During 2021, the positive earnings contributions from Advanced Disposal were offset by elevated depreciation, depletion and amortization of acquired assets.
(b) “Other” includes (i) elements of our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our Solid Waste business, net of intercompany activity.

The decrease in income from operations in 2022, as compared renewable energy credits generated by our WM Renewable Energy business.
(c) “Corporate and other” operating results reflect certain costs incurred for various support services that are not allocated to of our closed landfills. Income from operations for “Corporate and Other” also includes costs associated with our long-term incentive program.

These costs increased in 2022, as compared with 2021, primarily due to strategic investments in our digital platform and sustainability initiatives, partially offset by lower acquisition and integration related costs.
These costs increased in 2021, as compared with 2020, due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) increased labor, support and integration costs following our acquisition of Advanced Disposal; (iii) strategic investments in our digital platform; quarter of 2020 and changes in the measurement of our environmental remediation obligations and recovery assets in both 2020 and 2021.
(d) Intercompany operating revenues reflect each segment’s total service.

(e) For those items included in the determination of income from operations, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.

(f) Includes non-cash items. Capital not yet paid.

(g) The reconciliation of total assets reported above to total assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 is as follows (in millions):

Fluctuations in our operating results may be caused by many factors, including period-to-period changes in the relative contribution to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher construction and demolition waste volumes.

Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.

Service or operational disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results generated by their operations.
On the other hand, certain destructive weather and climate conditions, such as wildfires in the Western U.S. and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the lower margins.
