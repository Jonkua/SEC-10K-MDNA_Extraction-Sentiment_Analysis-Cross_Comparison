Item 7.        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

YEAR IN REVIEW
The Company's financial results in 2021 and 2022, on both an accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") basis and non-GAAP basis, continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 both impacted travel demand and created staffing challenges for the Company, particularly during January and February 2022. However, strong travel demand, especially associated with leisure travel, accelerated during March 2022 and continued through the remainder of the year, producing record operating revenues of $23.8 billion for 2022. Managed business revenues improved during 2022, but remained below 2019 levels, including approximately 20 percent below fourth quarter 2019 levels in fourth quarter 2022.

In late December 2022, the Company experienced wide-scale operational disruptions as extreme winter weather across a significant portion of the United States impacted its operational plan and flight schedules. Subsequent to Winter Storm Elliott, the Company was challenged in its efforts to realign flight crews, flight schedules, and fleet for a period of several days during this peak demand travel period. The Company returned to a normal operating schedule on December 30, 2022. However, this disruption and subsequent recovery efforts resulted in the cancellation of more than 16,700 flights during the period from December 21 to December 31, 2022. The Company estimates the financial impact of this disruption was approximately $800 million on a pre-tax basis, and resulted in the Company reporting a net loss of $220 million for fourth quarter 2022. A significant portion of this impact was due to the loss of Operating revenue associated with the flight cancellations that is estimated to be approximately $410 million. The remaining impact primarily related to a net increase of approximately $390 million in operating expenses, primarily due to travel expense reimbursements to Customers, the estimated value of Rapid Rewards points offered as a gesture of goodwill to Customers that are expected to be redeemed, and premium pay and additional compensation for Employees, which were partially offset by lower fuel and oil and profitsharing expenses.

Following the disruption, the Company has put mitigation elements in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions that could impede the travel plans of its Customers. These elements, along with efforts that remain in progress, currently include:
•Creating an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals an alert if the Company approaches predefined operational thresholds,
•Establishing supplemental staffing that can quickly mobilize to support Crew recovery efforts,
•Enhancing its Crew engagement technology to better communicate with large numbers of Crew Members during frequent schedule changes, and
•Updating and upgrading the Company’s Crew recovery system to not only solve current and future schedules, but also provide the ability to optimize established schedules as they are being revised during irregular operations.

Going forward, the Company is also taking additional steps to understand and review the disruption, which will determine the Company's future actions. The Company has engaged Oliver Wyman, a third-party global aviation consulting firm, to complete an assessment of the event and make recommendations of additional mitigation steps for consideration. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors has established an Operations Review Committee that is working with the Company's Management to help oversee the Company's response. The Company will continue to provide further information regarding these ongoing efforts in future periods.

The Company recorded year-to-date GAAP and non-GAAP results for 2022, 2021, and 2019 as noted in the following tables. The Company believes comparisons of current year financial results to 2019 are relevant and show how the Company has continued to recover from the pandemic. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional detail regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

Net income (loss) per share, diluted $ 1.16 $ (2.15) n.m. $ 4.27 (72.8)

The comparison of the Company's financial results, as shown above on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, versus the year ended December 31, 2021, were impacted by the Company's receipt of $2.7 billion in grant allocations of payroll funding support ("Payroll Support") from the United States Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") in 2021 that significantly benefited 2021 results. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Operating revenues for year ended December 31, 2022, increased 50.8 percent versus 2021 and operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, exceeded the comparative 2019 pre-pandemic levels and was a Company annual record primarily due to strong leisure demand and higher yields. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, exceeded the comparative pre-pandemic 2019 levels primarily due to higher salaries, wages, and benefits expense and fuel prices.

On a non-GAAP basis, the Company's financial results improved significantly for the year ended December 31, 2022, versus the same prior year period due to the significant recovery in travel demand, which was aided by a reduction in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, an increase in vaccinations, and a decline in travel-related restrictions across the United States. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional detail regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

Operating Statistics

The Company provides the operating data below for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2019 because these statistics are commonly used in the airline industry and, therefore, allow readers to compare the Company’s performance against its results for prior periods, as well as against the performance of the Company’s peers.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company believes a comparison of its 2022 to 2019 (pre-pandemic) operating statistics is relevant and useful as the Company continues to recover from the pandemic. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, most of these operating statistics were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and decisions the Company made as a result of the pandemic although the effect in 2022 was primarily in first quarter. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

ASMs, year-over-year (a) Up ~10%
Economic fuel costs per gallon (b) (c) $3.25 to $3.35
Fuel hedging premium expense per gallon $0.06
Fuel hedging cash settlement gains per gallon $0.16
ASMs per gallon (fuel efficiency) 78 to 80

Scheduled debt repayments (millions) (f) ~$60
Interest expense (millions) ~$65

--------------------------------------------- ---------------
 2023 Estimation
ASMs, year-over-year (a) Up 16% to 17%
Economic fuel costs per gallon (b) (c) $2.90 to $3.00
Fuel hedging premium expense per gallon $0.06
Fuel hedging cash settlement gains per gallon $0.14
CASM-X, year-over-year (d) (e) Down 6% to 8%
Scheduled debt repayments (millions) ~$85
Interest expense (millions) ~$250
Aircraft (g) 843
Effective tax rate 23% to 24%
Capital spending (billions) (h) $4.0 to $4.5
(a) Available seat miles (ASMs, or capacity). The Company's flight schedule is currently published for sale through August 14, 2023. The Company continues to expect second quarter 2023 capacity to increase approximately 14 percent, year-over-year.
(b) See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information on special items. In addition, information regarding special items and economic results is included in the accompanying table Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Items (also referred to as "excluding special items").
(c) Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of January 20, 2023, first quarter and full year 2023 economic fuel costs per gallon are estimated to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 and $2.90 to $3.00, respectively, compared with the Company's previous estimations in the range of $3.00 to $3.10 and $2.85 to $2.95, respectively. Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets, or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
(d) Operating expenses per available seat mile, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing.
(e) Projections do not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate those items or expenses or their impact to its financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the fuel and oil expense line item. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for these projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.
(f) The Company expects to retire approximately $50 million in principal related to a lease buyout transaction in first quarter 2023, shifting this payment forward from the previous monthly payments scheduled throughout the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Combined with the retirement of $191 million in principal related to a lease buyout transaction in fourth quarter 2022, the Company's full year 2023 scheduled debt repayments remained roughly the same as its previous guidance.
(g) Aircraft on property, end of period. The Company ended 2022 with 770 Boeing 737 aircraft. The Company continues to estimate approximately 100 Boeing 737 MAX ("MAX") aircraft deliveries in 2023, including 30 Boeing 737-8 ("-8") aircraft deliveries expected in first quarter 2023. The Company continues to expect to retire 27 Boeing -700 aircraft in 2023, including

61

Table of Contents
5 -700 retirements in first quarter 2023. As a result of receiving two additional -8 deliveries in fourth quarter 2022, as compared with the Company's previous estimation, the Company now expects to end 2023 with 843 aircraft, compared with its previous guidance of 841 aircraft. The delivery schedule for the Boeing 737-7 ("-7") is dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") issuing required certifications and approvals to The Boeing Company ("Boeing") and the Company. The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the Company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's aircraft commitments with Boeing.
(h) Represents the Company's current estimate which continues to assume approximately 100 Boeing MAX aircraft deliveries and $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending in 2023.

Thus far in January 2023, the Company has experienced an increase in flight cancellations and a deceleration in bookings, primarily for January and February 2023 travel, which are assumed to be associated with the operational disruptions in December 2022. As a result, the Company currently estimates a negative revenue impact in the range of $300 million to $350 million in first quarter 2023. Encouragingly, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, including notable strength in Rapid Rewards® redemptions. Currently, March 2023 leisure booking and yield trends appear strong, and are trending in line with the Company's expectations at the time of its Investor Day in early December 2022. The recent improvements in close-in booking trends are encouraging, and the Company currently expects March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to March 2019 levels.

The Company continues to experience year-over-year inflationary and other cost pressures in first quarter 2023, in particular from higher labor rates and accruals for all Employee work groups, as well as higher rate estimates for benefits and airport costs. The Company currently expects its first quarter 2023 CASM-X to increase in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent, year-over-year—approximately two points higher than its previous guidance of flat to up 2 percent, year-over year. Half of the two-point increase is attributable to a continuation of premium pay in January 2023 related to the December 2022 operational disruptions, and the remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts.

The Company currently expects its full year 2023 CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6 percent to 8 percent, year-over-year—approximately five points lower than its previous guidance to decrease in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent, year-over-year. The vast majority of the five-point decrease in 2023 is due to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 available seat miles and higher fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses than expected—both attributable to the December 2022 operational disruptions—offset slightly by an increase in 2023 labor accruals for the Company’s open labor contracts. The Company plans to hire more than 7,000 new Employees, net of attrition, in 2023, a nearly 40 percent decrease from 2022 net hiring levels.

COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts

As detailed in Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in connection with the major negative impact of COVID-19 on air carriers, the Company received significant financial assistance from Treasury in the form of Payroll Support, and this assistance had a significant impact on the Company's reported GAAP financial results in 2021. Such impact ended in third quarter 2021, and the Company's 2022 results do not reflect the benefit of this Payroll Support, and its future periods are not expected to benefit from such Payroll Support. However, future cash flows will be impacted through the portion of Payroll Support that was in the form of loans that remain outstanding and will have to be repaid to Treasury.

During second quarter 2020, the Company introduced Voluntary Separation Program 2020 ("Voluntary Separation Program") and the Extended Emergency Time Off ("Extended ETO") program which helped closer align staffing to reduced flight schedules and enabled the Company to avoid involuntary furloughs and layoffs associated with the impacts of the pandemic. Approximately 16,000 Employees elected to participate in one of these programs. All Employees that elected to participate in the Extended ETO program have since returned or been recalled to work, or have chosen to permanently separate from the Company, and no Employees were on Extended ETO past March 31, 2022. The Company realized approximately $1.1 billion of full year 2021 cost savings from the Voluntary Separation Program and Extended ETO but experienced no material cost savings from these programs beyond 2021. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Table of Contents

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company hired more than 11,500 Employees, net of attrition, and had returned to overall pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022. Thus, the Company's number of active full-time equivalents Employees increased by 21.0 percent from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, while the year-over-year increase in capacity or ASMs was 12.5 percent. The Company has been making additional investments to attract and retain talent, including the decision in fourth quarter 2021 to further raise the Company's starting hourly pay rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour for certain of its workgroups, subject, in each case, to acceptance of such change by the applicable union.

Company Overview

The Company has entered into supplemental agreements in 2022 with The Boeing Company ("Boeing") to increase aircraft orders and accelerate certain options with the goals of improving potential growth opportunities and frequencies to better align with the pre-pandemic operational route network, lowering operating costs, and further modernizing its fleet with less carbon-intensive aircraft. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company expects that more than half of the MAX aircraft in its firm order book will replace a significant amount of its 426 -700 aircraft over the next 10 to 15 years to support the modernization of the Company's fleet, a key component of the Company's environmental sustainability efforts. The Company's order book with Boeing as of December 31, 2022, consists of a total of 417 MAX firm orders (182 -7 aircraft and 235 -8 aircraft) for the years 2023 through 2030 and 147 MAX options (-7s or -8s) for years 2024 through 2027. Given Boeing's supply chain challenges and the current status of the -7 certification, aircraft delivery delays are currently expected to extend into 2024.

The Company ended 2022 with 770 Boeing 737 aircraft, including 137 -8 aircraft. During 2022, the Company retired 26 -700 aircraft and took delivery of 68 -8 aircraft. The Company also completed the purchase of 31 finance lease -700 aircraft and is expecting to finalize the purchase of eight additional finance lease -700 aircraft by the end of February 2023. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

The Company has published its flight schedule through August 14, 2023. The Company is expected to be limited by Pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023; therefore, it is not expected that aircraft delivery delays would result in required changes to the Company's published flight schedules. During 2022, the Company has primarily focused on restoring its network, principally in cities with a very strong Customer base, by adding city pair frequencies and connecting new service with existing points-of-strength to increase Customer depth.

On March 24, 2022, the Company announced a new fare product, Wanna Get Away Plus™, which became available to Customers in May 2022. Wanna Get Away Plus provides Customers with more flexibility, choice, and rewards for a modest buy-up from the Company's Wanna Get Away® fare product. In addition to all of the usual day of travel benefits and booking flexibility offered to Customers across all of the Company's fares, Wanna Get Away Plus provides additional benefits as compared with the Wanna Get Away fare product, including:

•Transferable flight credit(s), a new benefit that generally enables Customers to make a one-time transfer of eligible unused flight credit(s) to a new traveler for future use;
•More flexibility through same-day confirmed change/same-day standby; and
•More earning power in the Company's Rapid Rewards® loyalty program, with 8X points awarded on flights instead of the 6X points awarded on Wanna Get Away fares.

In July 2022, the Company announced that flight credits will no longer expire. The Company expects that this policy change, combined with its other attractive brand attributes, will contribute to an increase in Customer loyalty. Flight credits resulting from canceling reservations previously were valid for no longer than one year from the date of original purchase. Flight credits for non-refundable fares will be issued as long as the reservation is cancelled more than 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure. Flight credits or refunds for refundable fares will be issued regardless of cancellation time. Flight credits unexpired on, or created on or after July 28, 2022 do not expire and will show an expiration date (12/31/2040) until the Company's systems are updated. A flight credit with an

63

expiration date on or before July 27, 2022, has expired in accordance with its previously stated expiration date. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

On December 6, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors reinstated and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share to Shareholders of record at the close of business on January 10, 2023, on all shares then issued and outstanding, to be paid on January 31, 2023. The Company's quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share, or $0.72 per share annualized, is equivalent to its dividend prior to the pandemic.

In 2021, the Company announced near- and long-term environmental sustainability goals, in addition to a series of actions and initiatives designed to assist the Company in achieving these goals. The Company continually monitors developments related to climate change and evaluates its goals and progress against these developments. The Company expects its path toward achievement of these goals will depend on, among other things (i) increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel; (ii) improved fuel efficiency from fleet renewal or planned fuel efficiency initiatives; (iii) operational initiatives; and (iv) technological innovation.

During 2022, the Company joined the Vision 2045 campaign, a collaboration among multiple organizations and companies to share films and resources that aim to inspire businesses and people to take action toward a more sustainable future. In addition, during 2022, the Company invested in SAFFiRE Renewables, LLC (“SAFFiRE”), a company formed by D3MAX, LLC, as part of a Department of Energy (“DOE”)-backed project to develop and produce scalable, SAF. Funded with a DOE grant matched by the Company's investment, SAFFiRE intends to utilize technology developed by the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory to convert corn stover, a widely available waste feedstock in the United States, into renewable ethanol that then would be upgraded into SAF.

As part of its commitment to corporate sustainability, on April 22, 2022, the Company published its 2021 One Report describing the Company's sustainability strategies, which include the Company’s fuel conservation and emissions mitigation initiatives and other efforts to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and address other environmental matters such as energy and water conservation, waste minimization, and recycling. The Company also published its first ever Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") Report on April 22, 2022. A companion piece to the One Report, the DEI Report takes a deeper dive into the Company's DEI goals, and initiatives and highlights the expected path forward. Information contained in the Southwest One Report and/or the DEI Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Form 10-K. While the Company believes that the disclosures contained in the Southwest One Report, the DEI Report, and other voluntary disclosures regarding environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters are responsive to various areas of investor interest, the Company believes that certain of these disclosures do not currently address matters that are material in the near term to the Company’s operations, strategy, financial condition, or financial results, although this view may change in the future based on new information that could materially alter the estimates, assumptions, or timelines used to create these disclosures. Given the estimates, assumptions, and timelines used to create the Southwest One Report, the DEI Report, and other voluntary disclosures, the materiality of these disclosures is inherently difficult to assess.

2022 Compared with 2021

Operating Revenues
Passenger revenues for 2022 increased by $7.3 billion, or 52.2 percent, compared with 2021. On a unit basis, Passenger revenues increased 35.3 percent, year-over-year. The increase in Passenger revenues on both a dollar and unit basis was primarily due to the easing of negative impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in improvements in Passenger demand and bookings, the majority of which were for leisure oriented travel, in 2022, compared with the severe decline in demand and bookings resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic for the majority of 2021. For 2022, the year-over-year RASM increase was primarily driven by an increase in yield of 27.3 percent coupled with an increase in Load factor of 4.9 points.

Freight revenues for 2022 decreased by $10 million, or 5.3 percent, compared with 2021, primarily due to capacity challenges driven by an increase in Passenger demand resulting in reduced space for cargo shipments.

64

Table of Contents
Other revenues for 2022 increased by $692 million, or 45.0 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar basis, approximately 55 percent of the increase was associated with additional revenues generated from the Company's new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A. ("Chase") secured in December 2021. The remaining increase in Other revenues was primarily due to revenue from business partners, including Chase, as the rebound in travel demand also resulted in higher spend on the Company's co-brand credit card, as well as additional revenues earned through the Company's rental car and hotel partners.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2022 increased by $8.7 billion, or 62.0 percent, compared with 2021, while capacity increased 12.5 percent over the same prior year period. Approximately 30 percent of the operating expense increase was due to $2.7 billion in Payroll Support allocated to offset a portion of salaries, wages, and benefits in 2021, compared with no support received in 2022. In addition, approximately 30 percent of the increase was due to higher Fuel and oil expense and approximately 20 percent of the increase was due to higher Salaries, wages, and benefits. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in Operating expenses for airlines have been largely driven by changes in capacity, or ASMs. The following table presents the Company's Operating expenses per ASM for 2022 and 2021, followed by explanations of these changes on a dollar basis. Unless otherwise specified, changes on a per ASM basis were driven by changes in capacity, which increased with the improvement of travel demand, causing the Company's fixed costs to be spread over significantly more ASMs.

Total 15.36 ¢ 10.66 ¢ 4.70 ¢ 44.1 %

Operating expenses per ASM for 2022 increased by 44.1 percent, compared with 2021. Approximately, 50 percent of the year-over-year unit cost increase was driven by Payroll Support received in 2021, including from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Approximately, 30 percent of the increase was due to an increase in fuel expense. Operating expenses per ASM for 2022, excluding Fuel and oil expense, profitsharing, and special items (a non-GAAP financial measure), increased, year-over-year primarily due to an increase in Other Operating Expense due to Winter Storm Elliott and the operation disruption. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional detail regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense for 2022 increased by $1.6 billion, or 21.1 percent, compared with 2021. On a per ASM basis, Salaries, wages, and benefits expense for 2022 increased 7.5 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar basis, approximately 40 percent of the increase was driven by an increase in capacity and number of trips flown, approximately 30 percent of the increase was due to step/pay rate increases for certain workgroups, which included open labor contract accruals, and approximately 15 percent of the increase was a result of incentive, gratitude, and premium pay offered to the Company's Operations Employees in an effort to address available staffing challenges related to the Omicron variant in first quarter 2022 and challenges related to the operational disruption in December 2022.

Payroll support and voluntary Employee programs, net had no amounts for 2022, and was a reduction to expense in 2021 and consisted primarily of the following items:

•$2.7 billion of Payroll Support proceeds allocated (credit to expense);
•$140 million net reduction in the Extended ETO liability (reduction to expense) relating to certain Employees being recalled prior to their previously elected return dates; and
•$117 million credit to expense associated with the Employee Retention Tax Credit for continuing to pay Employees' salaries during the time they were not working, as allowed under the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Fuel and oil expense for 2022 increased by $2.7 billion, or 80.5 percent, compared with 2021. On a per ASM basis, Fuel and oil expense for 2022 increased 60.6 percent. On a dollar basis, approximately 80 percent of the increase was attributable to an increase in jet fuel prices per gallon, and the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in fuel gallons consumed. On a per ASM basis, the increase was primarily due to higher jet fuel prices. The

Fuel hedging cash settlement gains per gallon $ 0.49 $ 0.05

See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional detail regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company's 2022 available seat miles per gallon ("fuel efficiency") declined 2.4 percent, year-over-year, due to increased load factors and the removal from storage and increased usage of certain of the Company's least fuel-efficient aircraft, the -700, to support sequentially increasing flight schedules. When compared with 2019, fuel efficiency increased by 2.1 percent due to the March 2021 return to service of the Company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, the MAX. The MAX remains critical to the Company's efforts to modernize its fleet, reduce carbon emissions intensity, and achieve its near-term environmental sustainability goals. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As of January 20, 2023, on an economic basis, the Company had derivative contracts in place related to expected future fuel consumption as follows:

------ -------------------------------------
Period Maximum fuel hedged percentage (a)(b)
 2023 50%
 2024 39%

(a) Based on the Company's current available seat mile plans. The Company is currently 56 percent hedged in first quarter 2023, 51 percent hedged in second quarter 2023, and 47 percent hedged in second half 2023.
(b)The Company's maximum fuel hedged percentage is calculated using the maximum number of gallons that are covered by derivative contracts divided by the Company's estimate of total fuel gallons to be consumed for each respective period. The Company's maximum number of gallons that are covered by derivative contracts may be at different strike prices and at strike prices materially higher than the current market prices. The volume of gallons covered by derivative contracts that ultimately get exercised in any given period may vary significantly from the volumes used to calculate the Company's maximum fuel hedged percentages, as market prices and the Company's fuel consumption fluctuate.

As a result of applying hedge accounting in prior periods, the Company has amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") that will be recognized in earnings in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle. The following table displays the Company's estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts (not considering the impact of the cash collateral provided to or received from counterparties - see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), as well as the deferred amounts in AOCI at December 31, 2022, and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and/or be recognized in earnings (in millions):

Maintenance materials and repairs expense for 2022 decreased by $2 million, or 0.2 percent, compared with 2021. On a per ASM basis, Maintenance materials and repairs expense decreased 10.8 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar and per ASM basis, the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in engines and components expense driven by the Company's "power-by-the-hour" contract for the -700 engines expiring at the end of 2021, in which expense was incurred based primarily upon engine hours flown. At January 1, 2022, a time and materials contract commenced, pursuant to which -700 engine expense is based on actual repairs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of various airframe and engine repairs as a result of maintenance vendor price escalation and an increase in heavy airframe check volume due to deferring costs and reduced operations in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Landing fees and airport rentals expense for 2022 increased by $52 million, or 3.6 percent, compared with 2021. On a per ASM basis, Landing fees and airport rentals expense decreased 7.3 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar basis, approximately 50 percent of the increase was due to an increase in landing fees from the increased number of trips flown and approximately 50 percent was due to an increase in space rental rates and usage at various stations throughout the network, partially offset by higher settlements received from various airports in 2022.

Depreciation and amortization expense for 2022 increased by $79 million, or 6.2 percent, compared with 2021. On a per ASM basis, Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 5.2 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar basis, approximately 50 percent of the increase was due to several technology assets being placed into service since 2021, 35 percent of the increase was primarily due to the purchase of 68 -8 aircraft since 2021, and the remainder

68

Table of Contents
was due to decreasing the airframe salvage value for the entire owned -700 fleet and accelerating the depreciation for certain -700 aircraft planned for early retirement in 2023.

Other operating expenses for 2022 increased by $1.3 billion, or 56.0 percent, compared with 2021. Included within this line item was aircraft rentals expenses in the amount of $195 million and $205 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. On a per ASM basis, Other operating expenses increased 38.7 percent, compared with 2021. On a dollar and per ASM basis, approximately 40 percent of the increase was driven by costs associated with the December 2022 operational disruption, including estimated travel expense reimbursements being provided to impacted Customers and the estimated value of Rapid Rewards points offered as a gesture of goodwill to Customers that are expected to be redeemed. Approximately 20 percent of the increase was due to higher revenue related expenses (including credit card processing charges) associated with the significant increase in Passenger revenues versus 2021. The majority of the remainder of the year-over-year increases on a dollar and per ASM basis was due to various flight-driven expenses.

Other expenses (income)

Interest expense for 2022 decreased by $127 million, or 27 percent, compared with 2021. Approximately 60 percent of the decrease was due to elimination of the debt discount due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, and 40 percent of the decrease was due to various debt repurchases throughout 2022, resulting in less fixed interest expense. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Capitalized interest for 2022 increased by $3 million, or 8.3 percent, compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in average progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries.

Interest income for 2022 increased by $204 million, compared with 2021, due to higher interest rates.

Loss on extinguishment of debt for 2022 increased by $165 million, compared with 2021, primarily due to repurchases of $486 million face value of the Company's 1.25% Convertible Notes due 2025 (the "Convertible Notes") during 2022. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other (gains) losses, net, primarily includes amounts recorded as a result of the Company's hedging activities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's hedging activities. The following table displays the components of Other (gains) losses, net, for 2022 and 2021:

Income Taxes

The Company's annual 2022 effective tax rate was 25.9 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2021. The year-over-year decline in the tax rate is due to higher state taxes in 2021 and tax planning benefits recognized in 2022 related to federal tax credits and a partial tax deduction for losses incurred on repurchases of the Convertible Notes.

Table of Contents
Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These GAAP financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.

As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information (also referred to as "excluding special items"), including results that it refers to as "economic," which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that relate to the Company’s performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income (loss), non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Income (loss) before income taxes, non-GAAP; Provision (benefit) for income taxes, net, non-GAAP; Net income (loss), non-GAAP; Net income (loss) per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents). The Company's economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company’s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of Fuel and oil expense, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Further information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s GAAP results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed "special items," that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. For the periods presented, in addition to the items discussed above, special items include:
1.Proceeds related to the Payroll Support programs, which were used to pay a portion of Employee salaries, wages, and benefits;
2.Charges and adjustments to previously accrued amounts related to the Company's extended leave programs;
3.Adjustments for prior period losses reclassified from AOCI associated with forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that were terminated in prior periods related to 12 -8 aircraft leases;

72

Table of Contents
4.Noncash impairment charges, primarily associated with adjustments to the salvage values for previously retired airframes;
5.Unrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities; and
6.Losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the Company's convertible notes and early prepayment of debt.

In third quarter 2022, management determined that presentation within its income statement would be enhanced by classification of Loss on extinguishment of debt as a separate line item, rather than its prior presentation where it was included as a component of Other (gains) losses, net. Such losses are incurred as a result of opportunistic decisions made by the Company to prepay portions of its debt, most of which was taken on during the pandemic in order to provide liquidity during the prolonged downturn in air travel. Due to the nature of these losses, which are difficult to accurately predict, and due to the fact that they are not representative of the Company’s day-to-day airline operating performance, the Company has included such amounts as special items and thus excluded them from certain of its non-GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliations.

Because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the Company’s ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of special items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company’s management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel Net income (loss), non-GAAP; Net income (loss) per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The enormous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. travel industry created an urgent liquidity crisis, especially during 2020, for the entire airline industry, including the Company. However, due to the Company's pre-pandemic low balance sheet leverage, large base of unencumbered assets, and investment-grade credit ratings, the Company was able to quickly access additional liquidity during 2020, as Customer cancellations and ticket refunds spiked and sales and revenues dropped while the Company continued to experience significant fixed operating expenses. See Note 2 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the transactions completed and assistance obtained under Payroll Support programs.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2022 was $3.8 billion, and net cash provided by operating activities for 2021 was $2.3 billion. Operating cash inflows are historically primarily derived from providing air transportation to Customers. The vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and, in some cases, several months before the anticipated travel date. Operating cash outflows are related to the recurring expenses of airline operations. The operating cash flows for 2022 were largely impacted by the Company's net income (as adjusted for noncash items), a $525 million increase in Air traffic liability driven by higher ticket sales related to an increase in travel demand, a $472 million cash tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service associated with the 2020 tax year, and a $139 million cash excise tax refund for excise taxes remitted to taxing authorities for which the subsequent flights were canceled by Customers, resulting in amounts due back to the Company. Cash flows associated with entering into new fuel derivatives, which are classified as Other, net, operating cash flows, were net outflows of $81 million in 2022 and $34 million in 2021. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Operating cash flows for 2021 included $2.7 billion in Payroll Support program grant proceeds received and $591 million increase in Air traffic liability driven by increased ticket sales related to an increase in leisure travel demand. Net cash provided by operating activities is primarily used to finance capital expenditures, repay debt, and provide working capital. Historically, the Company has also used Net cash provided by operating activities to fund stock repurchases and pay dividends; however these shareholder return activities were suspended through September 30, 2022, due to restrictions associated with the payroll assistance under the Payroll Support programs and the Company's amended and restated revolving credit facility. On December 6, 2022, the Company reinstated and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share to Shareholders of record at the close of business on January 10, 2023, on all shares then issued and outstanding, to be paid on January 31, 2023. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on restrictions associated with the Payroll Support Programs.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2022 was $3.7 billion, and net cash used in investing activities for 2021 was $1.3 billion. Investing activities in both years included Capital expenditures, and changes in the balance of the Company's short-term and noncurrent investments. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion, compared with $505 million in the same prior year period. Capital expenditures increased, year-over-year, largely due to a substantial increase in progress and delivery payments made for current period and future aircraft deliveries during 2022, compared to the same prior year period, when progress payments were not made through November 2021 due to delivery credits provided by Boeing to the Company resulting from the settlement of 2020 estimated damages relating to the FAA grounding of the MAX aircraft. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Capital expenditures during 2022 also included approximately $174 million associated with the Company's purchase of 31 finance leased aircraft from the lessor. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The Company estimates its 2023 capital spending to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion, which assumes approximately 100 MAX aircraft deliveries in 2023. The Company's 2023 capital spending guidance continues to include approximately $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Including both capital spending and operating expense budgets, the Company currently expects to spend approximately $1.3 billion in 2023 on technology investments, upgrades, and system maintenance.

Net cash used in financing activities for 2022 was $3.0 billion, and net cash provided by financing activities for 2021 was $359 million, respectively. During 2022, the Company repaid $3.1 billion in debt and finance lease obligations, including a $1.3 billion prepayment for all of its outstanding 4.75% Notes due 2023 and the extinguishment of $486 million in principal of its Convertible Notes for cash payments totaling $648 million. The Company may engage in early debt repurchases from time to time and some of these early future repurchases are not included in the Company's current maturities of long-term debt. Also, see investing activities section above and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's purchase of finance leased aircraft, which resulted in a $191 million elimination of the Company's remaining finance lease obligations for these aircraft. During 2021, the Company's financing activities included borrowing $1.1 billion under Payroll Support programs. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company also repaid $905 million in debt and finance lease obligations, including the extinguishment of $203 million in principal of its Convertible Notes for cash payments totaling $293 million during 2021.

A discussion of the Company's most significant drivers impacting cash flow for 2020 are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, under Part II Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources.

The Company is a "well-known seasoned issuer" and currently has an effective shelf registration statement registering an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future sales. The Company currently intends to use the proceeds from any future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes.

The Company has access to $1.0 billion under its amended and restated revolving credit facility (the "Amended A&R Credit Agreement"). There were no amounts outstanding under the Amended A&R Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Although not the case at December 31, 2022 due to the Company's significant financing activities throughout the early stages of the pandemic, the Company has historically carried a working capital deficit, in which its current liabilities exceed its current assets. This is common within the airline industry and is primarily due to the nature of the Air traffic liability account, which is related to advance ticket sales, unused flight credits available to Customers, and loyalty deferred revenue, which are performance obligations for future Customer flights, do not require future settlement in cash, and are mostly nonrefundable. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The Company believes it has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, and anticipated future internally generated funds from operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following discussion includes various short-term and long-term material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, but does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Given the Company's current liquidity position, available resources, and prevailing outlook, it expects to be able to fulfill both its short-term and long-term material cash requirements. The amounts disclosed are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts discussed herein.

Debt

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the Company's debt and the timing of expected and future principal payments. The Company also has significant future obligations associated with fixed interest payments associated with its debt. As of December 31, 2022, future interest payments associated with its fixed rate debt (excluding interest associated with finance leases) were $239 million in 2023, $238 million in 2024, $198 million in 2025, $166 million in 2026, $114 million in 2027, and $161 million thereafter.

The Company's Convertible Notes did not meet the criteria to be converted by holders as of the date of the financial statements, and thus are classified as Long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. If the provisions were met to allow holders to exercise their conversion option on these instruments, all of the remaining convertible notes would be reclassified as a current obligation. Also, the Company has engaged in transactions with certain convertible debt holders to purchase their instruments in private transactions from time to time in cash, and may continue to do so in future periods. The Company considers its prevailing stock price, the trading price of its convertible debt instruments, and its available liquidity in determining how much of these instruments it may attempt to repurchase in such transactions.

Leases

The Company enters into leases for aircraft, airports and other real property, and other types of equipment in the normal course of business. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

Aircraft purchase commitments

The Company is required to make cash deposits toward the purchase of aircraft in advance. These deposits are classified as Deposits on flight equipment purchase contracts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the aircraft is delivered, at which time deposits previously made are deducted from the final purchase price of aircraft and are reclassified as Flight equipment. See Part I, Item 2 for a complete table of the Company's contractual firm deliveries and options for -7 and -8 aircraft, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial commitments related to these firm deliveries.

Other

The Company's other material cash requirements primarily consist of outlays associated with normal operating expenses of the airline, including payroll, fuel, airport costs, etc. While many of these expenses are variable in nature, some of the expenditures can be somewhat fixed in the short-term due to the lead-time involved in publishing the Company's flight schedule in advance and providing for resources to be available to operate those schedules.

The Company has a large net deferred tax liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferral of income taxes has resulted in a significant benefit to the Company and its liquidity position. Since the Company purchases the majority of the aircraft it acquires, it has been able to utilize accelerated depreciation methods (including bonus depreciation) available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in 2022 and in previous years, which has enabled the Company to accelerate cash tax benefits of depreciation. Based on the Company’s scheduled future aircraft deliveries from Boeing and existing tax laws in effect, the Company will continue to accelerate the cash income tax benefits related to aircraft purchases. Due to the Company's net taxable loss incurred in 2020, and a provision within the CARES Act that allowed entities to carry back such 2020 losses to prior periods of up to five years, and claim refunds of federal taxes paid, the Company received a significant cash tax refund of $472 million associated with this taxable loss from the Internal Revenue Service during second quarter 2022. The Company was in a net taxable loss position in 2022 and has federal and state operating loss carryforwards, $275 million and $43 million (tax-effected), respectively, to reduce taxable income in future periods. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company has paid in the past, and will continue to pay in the future, cash taxes to the various taxing jurisdictions where it operates. The Company expects to be able to continue to meet such obligations utilizing cash and investments on hand, as well as cash generated from its ongoing operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. The Company’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that both (i) are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and (ii) require management’s most subjective judgments. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.

Revenue Recognition

Tickets sold for Passenger air travel are initially deferred as Air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized and Air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided (i.e., when the flight takes place). Air traffic liability primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates, flight credits that are expected to be used in the future, and loyalty benefits that are expected to be redeemed in the future. Air traffic liability typically fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns, fare sale activity, and activity associated with the Company’s loyalty program. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Company's revenue recognition policies.

For air travel on Southwest, the amount of tickets (which includes flight credits--also referred to as partial tickets), that will go unused, referred to as breakage, is estimated and recognized in Passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed, in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the Customer, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ("ASC 606"). Estimating the amount of tickets that will ultimately go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment. The majority of the Company's tickets sold are nonrefundable, although flight credits created when a Customer cancels or modifies an existing flight itinerary can be applied towards the purchase of future travel. Unused flight credits are the primary source of breakage. Breakage estimates are based on historical experience over many years. Fully refundable tickets rarely go unused.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, for all Customer flight credits created or scheduled to expire between March 1 and September 7, 2020 associated with flight cancellations, the Company initially extended the expiration date to September 7, 2022. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these extended flight credits. Since the Company did not have historical data to enable it to accurately estimate the pattern of usage of these extended credits, these credits have been classified as a current liability throughout their history. Subsequently, on July 28, 2022, the Company modified its policy and announced that all unexpired flight credits as of that date, including these extended flight credits, will no longer have an expiration date and thus will be able to be redeemed by Customers indefinitely. This change in policy was considered a contract modification under ASC 606 and the Company accounted for such change prospectively in third quarter 2022. The Company’s balance of existing Customer flight credits as of the modification date was approximately $1.9 billion, including the extended flight credits that had been set to expire on September 7, 2022.

As a result of changes in observed Customer travel habits and behaviors during 2021 and 2022, the Company increased its estimates of “normal” Customer flight credits that are expected to go unused, as Customer redemptions of these "normal" credits had been at a slower rate than the Company’s historical data for similar credits in periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Company continues to believe a portion of Customer flight credits will go unused following the Company's change in policy, including a portion of flight credits issued after July 28, 2022, the Company expects its prospective breakage rate associated with such flight credits to be at or slightly lower than historical pre-pandemic levels due to the fact that such flight credits no longer have an expiration date.

77

Table of Contents
Observed Customer behavior that differs from historical experience can cause actual ticket breakage to differ significantly from estimates. Assumptions about Customer behavior are reviewed frequently and corresponding adjustments are made to breakage estimates, as needed, when observed behaviors differ from historical experience. Assumptions about Customer behavior can be impacted by several factors including, but not limited to: fare increases, fare sales, changes to the Company's ticketing policies, changes to the Company’s refund, exchange and unused flight credit policies, seat availability, and economic factors. The Company’s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimates, actual ticket breakage may vary from estimated amounts.

 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes unobservable (Level 3) inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2022, these consisted of its fuel derivative option contracts, which were an asset of $512 million. The Company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for more information on these risk management activities, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company’s fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments, and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about fair value measurements.

All derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, the Company was a party to over 125 separate financial derivative instruments related to its fuel hedging program for future periods. Changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices. For example, during 2022, market "spot" prices for Brent crude oil peaked at a high average daily price of approximately $128 per barrel and hit a low average daily price of approximately $76 per barrel. During 2021, market spot prices ranged from a high average daily price of approximately $86 per barrel to a low average daily price of approximately $51 per barrel. Market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand, inventory levels, weather events, refinery capacity, political agendas, the value of the U.S. dollar, geopolitical events, the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and general economic conditions, among other items. Historically, the financial derivative instruments utilized by the Company primarily are a combination of collars, purchased call options, call spreads, put spreads, and fixed price swap agreements.

The Company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in "over-the-counter" markets. Since the majority of the Company’s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange, the Company estimates their fair values. Depending on the type of instrument, the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.

The Company determines the fair value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets, can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets, or are quoted by its counterparties. In situations where the Company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties, it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared. The Company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds. Due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining the estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable (primarily implied volatility), the Company has categorized these option contracts as Level 3. Although implied volatility is not directly observable, it is derived primarily from changes in market prices, which are observable. Based on the Company’s portfolio of option contracts as of December 31, 2022, a 10 percent change in implied volatility, holding all other factors constant, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of this portfolio of less than $194 million.

Fair values for financial derivative instruments are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle. However, once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is

Table of Contents
purchased and consumed, all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements. Although the Company continues to use a prospective assessment to determine that commodities continue to qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the Company hedges, there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future. This is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes. Increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time, especially if such volatility were to worsen, could cause the Company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program. Further, should the anticipated fuel purchases covered by the Company's fuel hedges no longer be probable of occurring, the Company would discontinue hedge accounting. The loss of hedge accounting would create further volatility in the Company’s GAAP financial results.

As discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, any changes in fair value of cash flow derivatives designated as hedges are offset within AOCI until the period in which the expected future cash flow impacts earnings. Any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in earnings within Other (gains) losses, net, in the period of the change. Because the Company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds, and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash, the Company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the Company’s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, the Company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements, which provide for parties (or the Company) to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels. Since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding fuel derivative contracts, this provides further validation to the Company’s estimate of fair values.

Loyalty Accounting

The Company utilizes estimates in the recognition of revenues and liabilities associated with its loyalty program. These estimates primarily include the liability associated with Rapid Rewards loyalty member ("Member") account balances that are expected to be redeemed for travel or other products at a future date. Loyalty account balances include points earned through flights taken, points sold to Customers, or points earned through business partners participating in the loyalty program.

Under the Southwest Rapid Rewards loyalty program, Members earn points for every dollar spent on Southwest base fares. The amount of points earned under the program is based on the fare amount and fare type, with higher fare types (e.g., Business Select) earning more points than lower fare types (e.g., Wanna Get Away). Each fare type is associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the fare amount for the flight by the fare type multiplier. Likewise, the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight can differ based on the fare type purchased. Under the program, (i) Members are able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, with no blackout dates; and (ii) points do not expire. In addition, Members are able to redeem their points for items other than travel on Southwest Airlines, such as international flights on other airlines, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars, gift cards, event tickets, and more. In addition to earning points for revenue flights and qualifying purchases with Rapid Rewards Partners, Members also have the ability to purchase, gift, and transfer points, as well as the ability to donate points to selected charities.

The Company utilizes the deferred revenue method of accounting for points earned through flights taken in its loyalty program. The Company also sells points and related services to business partners participating in the loyalty program. Liabilities are recorded for the relative standalone selling price of the Rapid Rewards points which are awarded each period. The liabilities recorded represent the total number of points expected to be redeemed by Members, regardless of whether the Members may have enough to qualify for a full travel award. At December 31, 2022, the loyalty liabilities were approximately $5.2 billion, including $3.0 billion classified within Air traffic liability and $2.2 billion classified as Air traffic liability – noncurrent.

In order to determine the value of each loyalty point, certain assumptions must be made at the time of measurement, which include an allocation of passenger revenue between the flight and loyalty points earned by passengers, and the fair value of Rapid Rewards points, which are generally based on their redemption value to the Customer. See

79

Table of Contents
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on determining the estimated fair value of each loyalty point.

The majority of the points sold to business partners are through the Southwest co-branded credit card agreement ("Agreement") with Chase Bank USA, N.A. Consideration received as part of this Agreement is subject to ASC 606. The most recent instance in which the Agreement was amended was in fourth quarter 2021. The Agreement has the following multiple elements: travel points to be awarded, use of the Southwest Airlines’ brand and access to Rapid Rewards Member lists, advertising elements, and the Company’s resource team. These elements are combined into two performance obligations, transportation and marketing, and consideration from the Agreement is allocated based on the relative selling price of each performance obligation.

Significant management judgment was used to estimate the selling price of each of the performance obligations in the Agreement at inception, including each time in which the Agreement has been materially amended. The objective is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company determines the best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of points awarded, and the number of points redeemed. The Company estimates the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple performance obligations. The Company records revenue related to air transportation when the transportation is delivered and revenue related to marketing elements when the performance obligation is satisfied. A one percent increase or decrease in the Company's estimate of the standalone selling prices, implemented as of January 1, 2022, causing a change to the allocation of proceeds to air transportation would not have had a material impact on the Company's Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Under its current program, Southwest estimates the portion of loyalty points that will not be redeemed. In estimating the breakage, the Company takes into account the Member’s past behavior, as well as several factors related to the Member’s account that are expected to be indicative of the likelihood of future point redemption. These factors are typically representative of a Member’s level of engagement in the loyalty program. They include, but are not limited to, tenure with the program, points accrued in the program, and points redeemed in the program. The Company believes it has obtained sufficient historical behavioral data to develop a predictive statistical model to analyze the amount of breakage expected for all loyalty points. The Company updates this model at least annually, and applies the new breakage rates effective October 1st each year, or more frequently if required by changes in the business. Changes in the breakage rates applied annually in recent years have not had a material impact on Passenger revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2022, based on actual redemptions of points sold to business partners and earned through flights, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the estimated breakage rate would have resulted in a change to Passenger revenue of approximately $152 million (an increase in breakage would have resulted in an increase in revenue and a decrease in breakage would have resulted in a decrease in revenue). Given that Member behavior will continue to develop as the program matures, the Company expects the current estimates may change in future periods. However, the Company believes its current estimates are reasonable given current facts and circumstances.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix.

Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, construction in progress also includes $2.18 billion of servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required by our design manufacturers to fulfill certain purchase orders. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of the property and equipment depreciation expense was from servers and network assets depreciation of $5.29 billion, $4.94 billion, and $4.38 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion abandonment charge and $508 million impairment loss for data center assets and leasehold improvements assets, respectively, as a result of our restructuring efforts.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform.

Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

If the provisions were met to allow holders to exercise their conversion option on these instruments, all of the remaining convertible notes would be reclassified as a current obligation. Also, the Company has engaged in transactions with certain convertible debt holders to purchase their instruments in private transactions from time to time in cash, and may continue to do so in future periods. The Company considers its prevailing stock price, the trading price of its convertible debt instruments, and its available liquidity in determining how much of these instruments it may attempt to repurchase in such transactions.

['s significant financing activities throughout the early stages of the pandemic, the Company has historically carried a working capital deficit, in which its current liabilities exceed its current assets. This is common within the airline industry and is primarily due to the nature of the Air traffic liability account, which is related to advance ticket sales, unused flight credits available to Customers, and loyalty deferred revenue, which are performance obligations for future Customer flights, do not require future settlement in cash, and are mostly nonrefundable. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The Company believes it has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments, including unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, and anticipated future internally generated funds from operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
