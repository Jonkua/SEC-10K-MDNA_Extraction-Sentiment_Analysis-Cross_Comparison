Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our business and growth strategies, statements regarding the industry outlook and our expectations regarding the future performance of our business contained herein are forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” You should also review the “Risk Factors” section in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
We are an owner and acquirer of experiential real estate assets across leading gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure destinations. Our geographically diverse portfolio currently consists of 49 gaming facilities in the United States and Canada, including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort, three of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the Las Vegas Strip. Our entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services, experiences, products and continuous innovation. Across over 124 million square feet, our well-maintained properties are currently located across urban, destination and drive-to markets in fifteen states and Canada, contain approximately 59,300 hotel rooms and feature over 450 restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and sportsbooks.
Our portfolio also includes certain real estate debt investments, most of which we have originated for strategic reasons in connection with transactions that either do or may provide the potential to convert our investment into the ownership of certain of the underlying real estate in the future. In addition, we own approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip that is leased to Caesars, which we may look to monetize as appropriate. We also own four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties, two of which are in close proximity to the Las Vegas Strip.
We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe our election of REIT status, combined with the income generation from the Lease Agreements and loans, will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, providing investors with current income as well as long-term growth, subject to market conditions and the national and international macroeconomic environment. We conduct our real property business through our operating partnership, VICI OP, and our golf course business through a TRS, VICI Golf.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES
Acquisition Activity
•MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition. Subsequent to year-end, on January 9, 2023, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of the remaining 49.9% interest in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV (previously referred to as the “BREIT JV”) from BREIT (the “MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition”) for cash consideration of $1,261.9 million. We also assumed BREIT’s $1,497.0 million pro rata share of an aggregate $3.0 billion of property-level debt, which matures in 2032 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.558% per annum through March 2030. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the settlement of the November 2022 Forward Sale Agreements and ATM Forward Sale Agreements (each as defined in Note 11 - Stockholders Equity). The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease currently has annual rent of $303.8 million, all of which will be reflected in our Financial Statements following the closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition (and will have annual rent of approximately $310.0 million upon commencement of the next rental escalation on March 1, 2023). The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease has a remaining initial lease term of approximately 27 years (expiring in 2050), with two ten-year tenant renewal options. Rent under the lease agreement escalates annually at 2.0% through 2035 (year 15 of the initial lease term) and thereafter at the greater of 2.0% or CPI (subject to a 3.0% ceiling).
•PURE Canadian Gaming Transaction. Subsequent to year-end, on January 6, 2023, we acquired the real estate assets of PURE Casino Edmonton, PURE Casino Yellowhead, PURE Casino Calgary, and PURE Casino Lethbridge, all of which are located in Alberta, Canada, from PURE Canadian Gaming for an aggregate purchase price of approximately C$271.9 million (approximately US$200.8 million based on the exchange rate at the time of the acquisition) (the “PURE Canadian Gaming Transaction”). We financed the PURE Canadian Gaming Transaction with a combination of cash on hand and by drawing down C$140.0 million (approximately US$103.4 million based on the exchange rate at the time of the acquisition) under our Revolving Credit Facility. Simultaneous with the acquisition, we entered into the PURE Master Lease, which has an initial annual rent of approximately C$21.8 million (approximately US$16.1 million based on the exchange rate at the time of the acquisition), an initial term of 25 years, with four 5-year tenant renewal options, escalation of 1.25% per annum (with escalation of the greater of 1.5% and Canadian CPI, capped at 2.5%, beginning in lease year four) and minimum capital expenditure requirements of 1.0% of annual net revenue (excluding gaming equipment). The tenant’s obligations under the PURE Master Lease are guaranteed by the parent entity of PURE Canadian Gaming.

On December 22, 2022, we acquired the real estate assets of the Fitz Casino & Hotel, located in Tunica, Mississippi, and the WaterView Casino & Hotel, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi, from Foundation Gaming for an aggregate purchase price of $293.4 million (the “Foundation Gaming Transaction”). We financed the Foundation Gaming Transaction with cash on hand. Simultaneous with the acquisition, we entered into the Foundation Master Lease, which has an initial annual rent of $24.3 million, an initial term of 15 years, with four 5-year tenant renewal options, escalation of 1.0% per annum (with escalation of the greater of 1.5% and CPI, capped at 3%, beginning in lease year four) and minimum capital expenditure requirements of 1.0% of annual net revenue (excluding gaming equipment) over a rolling three-year period. The tenants’ obligations under the Foundation Master Lease are guaranteed by the parent entity, Foundation Gaming.
•Rocky Gap Casino Transaction. On August 24, 2022, we and Century Casinos entered into definitive agreements to acquire Rocky Gap Casino, located in Flintstone, Maryland, from Golden Entertainment, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $260.0 million. Pursuant to the transaction agreements, we will acquire an interest in the land and buildings associated with Rocky Gap Casino for approximately $203.9 million and Century Casinos will acquire the operating assets of the property for approximately $56.1 million. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, the Century Master Lease will be amended to include Rocky Gap Casino and annual rent will increase by $15.5 million. Additionally, the terms of the Century Master Lease will be extended such that, upon closing of the transaction, the lease will have a full 15-year initial base lease term remaining, with four 5-year tenant renewal options. The tenants’ obligations under the Century Master Lease will continue to be guaranteed by Century Casinos. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in mid-2023.
•MGP Transactions. On April 29, 2022, we closed on the previously announced MGP Transactions governed by the MGP Master Transaction Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired MGP for total consideration of $11.6 billion, plus the assumption of approximately $5.7 billion principal amount of debt, inclusive of our 50.1% share of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV CMBS debt. Upon closing, the MGP Transactions added $1,012.2 million of annualized rent to our portfolio from 15 Class A entertainment casino resort properties spread across nine regions and comprising 36,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of meeting and convention space and hundreds of food, beverage and entertainment venues. Under the terms of the MGP Master Transaction Agreement, each outstanding MGP Class A common share was converted into 1.366 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of VICI common stock. The fixed Exchange Ratio represented an agreed upon price of $43.00 per share of MGP Class A common shares based on VICI’s trailing 5-day volume weighted average price of $31.47 as of July 30, 2021. MGM received $43.00 per unit in cash for the redemption of the majority of its MGP OP units that it held for total cash consideration of approximately $4.404 billion and also retained approximately 12.2 million units in VICI OP. The MGP Class B share that was held by MGM was cancelled and ceased to exist at the effective time of the Mergers.
Simultaneous with the closing of the Mergers on April 29, 2022, we entered into the MGM Master Lease. The MGM Master Lease has an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year tenant renewal options and has an initial total annual rent of $860.0 million. Rent under the MGM Master Lease escalates at a rate of 2.0% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter at the greater of 2.0% per annum or the increase in CPI, subject to a 3.0% cap. The total annual rent under the MGM Master Lease was reduced by $90.0 million upon the close of MGM’s sale of the operations of the Mirage to Hard Rock and entrance into the Mirage Lease on December 19, 2022, and further reduced by $40.0 million upon the close of MGM’s sale of the operations of Gold Strike on February 15, 2023 (which takes the total annual rent under the MGM Master Lease to $730.0 million), each as described below. Additionally, we retained a 50.1% ownership stake in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV, which owns the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay. The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease provides for current total annual base rent of approximately $303.8 million, of which approximately $152.2 million was attributable to our investment in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV as of December 31, 2022, and an initial term of thirty years with two 10-year tenant renewal options. Rent under the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease escalates at a rate of 2.0% per annum for the first 15 years and thereafter at the greater of 2.0% per annum or CPI, subject to a 3.0% cap. Subsequent to year-end, on January 9, 2023, we closed on the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition and accordingly own 100% of the interest in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. On a combined basis, as of January 9, 2023, we receive approximately $1,073.8 million of annual rent under the MGM Master Lease and MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease. Refer to “MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition” above for further details. The tenant’s obligations under the MGM Master Lease and the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease continue to be guaranteed by MGM.
•Venetian Acquisition. On February 23, 2022, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Venetian Resort from Las Vegas Sands Corp. (“LVS”) for $4.0 billion in cash, and the Venetian Tenant acquired the operating assets of the Venetian Resort for $2.25 billion, of which $1.2 billion is in the form of a secured term loan from LVS and the remainder was paid in cash. We funded the Venetian

Acquisition with (i) $3.2 billion in net proceeds from the physical settlement of the March 2021 Forward Sale Agreements and the September 2021 Forward Sale Agreements, (ii) an initial draw on the Revolving Credit Facility of $600.0 million, and (iii) cash on hand. Simultaneous with the closing of the Venetian Acquisition, we entered into the Venetian Lease with the Venetian Tenant. The Venetian Lease has an initial total annual rent of $250.0 million and an initial term of 30 years, with two ten-year tenant renewal options. The annual rent is subject to escalation equal to the greater of 2.0% and the increase in the CPI, capped at 3.0%, beginning in the earlier of (i) the beginning of the third lease year, and (ii) the month following the month in which the net revenue generated by the Venetian Resort returns to its 2019 level (the year immediately prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) on a trailing twelve-month basis.
In connection with the Venetian Acquisition, we entered into a Partner Property Growth Fund Agreement (“Venetian PGF”) with the Venetian Tenant. Under the Venetian PGF, we agreed to provide up to $1.0 billion for various development and construction projects affecting the Venetian Resort to be identified by the Venetian Tenant and that satisfy certain criteria more particularly set forth in the Venetian PGF, in consideration of additional incremental rent to be paid by the Venetian Tenant under the Venetian Lease and calculated in accordance with a formula set forth in the Venetian PGF.
In addition, LVS agreed with the Venetian Tenant pursuant to an agreement (the “Contingent Lease Support Agreement”) entered into simultaneously with the closing of the Venetian Acquisition to provide lease payment support designed to guarantee the Venetian Tenant’s rent obligations under the Venetian Lease through 2023, subject to early termination if EBITDAR (as defined in such agreement) generated by the Venetian Resort in 2022 equals or exceeds $550.0 million, or a tenant change of control occurs. We were a third-party beneficiary of the Contingent Lease Support Agreement and had certain enforcement rights pursuant thereto. The EBITDAR generated by the operations of the Venetian Resort exceeded $550.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and, accordingly, the Contingent Lease Support Agreement early terminated in accordance with its terms.

•Entry into New Unsecured Credit Agreement. On February 8, 2022, we entered into the Credit Facilities pursuant to the Credit Agreement, comprised of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $2.5 billion scheduled to mature on March 31, 2026 and (ii) the Delayed Draw Term Loan in the amount of $1.0 billion scheduled to mature on March 31, 2025. Concurrently, we terminated our Secured Revolving Credit Facility (including the first priority lien on substantially all of VICI PropCo’s and its existing and subsequently acquired wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries’ material assets) and our 2017 Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7 - Debt). The Delayed Draw Term Loan was available to be drawn up to 12 months following the effective date and on February 8, 2023, the Delayed Draw Term Loan facility expired undrawn in accordance with its terms. The Revolving Credit Facility includes the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $1.0 billion in the aggregate to the extent that any one or more lenders (from the syndicate or otherwise) agree to provide such additional credit extensions. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at VICI LP’s option at a rate based on SOFR (including a credit spread adjustment) plus a margin ranging from 0.775% to 1.325% or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.325%, in each case, with the actual margin determined according to VICI LP’s debt ratings. On July 15, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended pursuant to a First Amendment among VICI LP and the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, in order to permit borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate principal amount of up to the equivalent of $1.25 billion.
•Entry into Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swap Agreements and U.S. Treasury Rate Locks. From December 2021 through April 2022, we entered into five forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $2,500.0 million and two U.S. Treasury Rate Lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks were intended to reduce the variability in the forecasted interest expense related to the fixed-rate debt we expected to incur in connection with closing the MGP Transactions. In connection with the April 2022 Notes offering, we settled the outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks for net proceeds of $206.8 million. Since the forward-starting swaps and treasury locks were hedging the interest rate risk on the April 2022 Notes, the unrealized gain in Accumulated other comprehensive income is being amortized over the term of the respective derivative instruments, which matches that of the underlying note, as a reduction in interest expense.
KEY TRENDS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS
Tenant and Industry Performance
Our tenants and the guarantors of their respective obligations, as applicable, under the Lease Agreements are leading gaming operators across the United States and Canada. Rental payments under the Lease Agreements comprise, and are expected to continue to comprise, a substantial majority of our revenues. Accordingly, we are dependent on, among other things, our tenants’ and, as applicable, their respective guarantors’, financial performance, the performance of the gaming industry and the health of the economies in the areas where our properties are located for the foreseeable future, and an event that has a material adverse effect on any of our tenant’s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the financial performance of our tenants and their respective guarantors also has a direct impact on our financial results in a given reporting period due to the impact of ASC 326 “Credit Losses” (“ASC 326”), which requires us to estimate and record non-cash expected credit losses related to our investments, including changes on a quarterly basis, that are recorded in our Statement of Operations and impact our reported net income. The change in non-cash allowance for credit losses for a given period is dependent upon, among other things, our tenants’ and guarantors’ financial performance. For more information regarding ASC 326, refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Strategy
Our business prospects and future growth will be significantly influenced by the success of our business strategy, and the timing, availability and terms of financing of any acquisitions and investments that we may complete, as well as broader macroeconomic and other conditions that affect our tenants’ operating and financial performance, including those described herein. Further, the pricing of any acquisitions or other investments we may consummate and the terms of any leases that we may enter into will significantly impact our future results. Competition to enter into transactions, including sale leaseback transactions, with attractive properties and desirable tenants is intense, and we can provide no assurance that any future acquisitions, investments or leases will be on terms as favorable to us as those relating to recent or historical transactions.
Impact of the Macroeconomic Environment
We anticipate that we would seek to finance our future growth with a combination of debt and equity, although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity and/or debt in such amounts on favorable terms, or at all, or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due to market conditions or otherwise. Recent macroeconomic volatility has introduced significant uncertainty and heightened risk for businesses, including us and our tenants, as a result of the current inflationary environment, including the impact of rising interest rates and increased cost of capital. Our tenants also face additional challenges, including potential changes in consumer confidence levels, behavior and spending and increased operational expenses, such as with respect to labor or energy costs. As a triple-net lessor, increased operational expenses at our leased properties are borne by our tenants and do not directly impact their rent obligations (other than with respect to underlying inflation as applied to the CPI-based escalators described below) or other obligations under our Lease Agreements.
However, the current environment, including rising interest rates and market volatility, impacts our business in certain respects, such as by increasing interest expense with respect to any borrowings under our Credit Facility, increasing volatility of our share price with respect to sales of common stock, and, with respect to potential transactions, evaluating asset and property values in discussions with potential counterparties and obtaining transaction financing on attractive terms, all of which could increase our cost of capital and negatively impact our growth prospects.
With respect to our Lease Agreements, which generally provide for annual rent escalation based on a specified percentage increase and/or increases in CPI, we expect that increasing inflation will result in additional rent increases over time under our CPI-based lease provisions (subject to any applicable caps or periods in which such provisions do not apply). However, these rent increases may not match increasing inflation during periods when inflation rates are greater than the applicable CPI-based caps.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, among broader public health, societal and global impacts, the pandemic has negatively impacted the economy, including the real estate industry and certain experiential sectors, and contributed to volatility and uncertainty in financial markets. Although our tenants’ operations at our leased properties are generally no longer subject to significant operating restrictions, with performance in many cases at or above pre-pandemic levels, they may continue to face challenges in operating their businesses due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as complying with any future operating restrictions, ensuring sufficient staffing and service levels, sustaining customer engagement and maintaining improved operating margins and financial performance.
Overall Implications of Such Material Trends on Our Business
As a triple-net lessor, we believe we are generally in a strong creditor position and structurally insulated from operational and performance impacts of our tenants, both positive and negative. However, the full extent to which the trends set forth herein adversely affect our tenants and/or ultimately impact us depends on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence, including our tenants’ financial performance, the direct and indirect effects of such trends discussed herein (including among other things, rising interest rates, inflation, economic recessions, consumer confidence levels and general conditions in the capital and credit markets) and the impact of any future measures taken in response to such trends on our tenants.

____________________
(1) Represents the MGM Master Lease, Harrah’s Call Properties (as defined in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), the JACK Master Lease and the Foundation Master Lease, all of which were sale leaseback transactions. In accordance with ASC 842, since the lease agreements were determined to meet the definition of a sales-type lease and control of the asset is not considered to have transferred to us, such lease agreements are accounted for as financings under ASC 310.
(2) Amounts represent the non-cash adjustment to income from sales-type leases, direct financing leases and lease financing receivables in order to recognize income on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the term of the leases.
Leasing revenue is generated from rent from our Lease Agreements. Total leasing revenue increased $1,050.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Total contractual leasing revenue increased $832.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increases were primarily driven by the addition of the MGM Master Lease, Venetian Lease and Foundation Master Lease to our portfolio in 2022, as well as the annual rent escalators from certain of our other Lease Agreements.
Income From Loans
Income from loans increased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by the addition and/or subsequent funding, as applicable, of the Great Wolf Northeast Loan, Fontainebleau Las Vegas Loan, Canyon Ranch Austin Loan, Great Wolf Gulf Coast Texas Loan, Great Wolf South Florida Loan, Cabot Citrus Farms Loan and Great Wolf Maryland loan to our real estate investment portfolio, partially offset by the repayment of the $70.0 million term loan with JACK Entertainment in October 2021.
Other Income
Other income increased $31.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven primarily by the additional income and offsetting expense as a result of the assumption of certain sub-leases in connection with the closing of the Venetian Acquisition and MGP Transactions. The Lease Agreements require the tenants to pay all costs associated with such ground and use sub-leases and provide for their direct payment to the landlord.
Golf Revenues
Revenues from golf operations increased $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily driven by an increase in rounds played at the Golf Courses and an increase in the contractual fees paid to us by Caesars for the use of our Golf Courses, pursuant to a golf course use agreement.

Operating Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operating expenses were comprised of the following items:

------------------------------------- ------- ------- ---- -------- -------- ------ ------- - -------
(In thousands) 2022 2021 Variance
General and administrative $ 48,340 $ 33,122 $ 15,218

Total operating expenses $ 990,900 $ 75,631 $ 915,269

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation, including stock-based compensation and the addition of new employees to the corporate team and additional expenses related to the significant growth of our business in 2022.
Other Expenses
Other expenses increased $31.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven primarily by the additional income and offsetting expense as a result of the assumption of certain sub-leases in connection with the Venetian Acquisition and MGP Transactions. The Lease Agreements require the tenants to pay all costs associated with such ground and use sub-leases and provide for their direct payment to the landlord.
Golf Expenses
Expenses from golf operations increased $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily driven by increased costs related to the number of rounds of golf played across our Golf Courses. In addition, $3.2 million and $3.1 million of depreciation expense was incurred primarily by the golf business during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Change in Allowance for Credit Losses
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an $834.5 million increase in our allowance for credit losses, or CECL allowance, primarily driven by initial CECL allowances on our acquisition activity during such period in the amount of $573.6 million, representing 68.7% of the total CECL allowance for the year ended December 31, 2022. The initial CECL allowances were in relation to (i) the closing of the MGP Transactions on April 29, 2022, which included the (a) classification of the MGM Master Lease as a lease financing receivable and (b) the sales-type sub-lease agreements that we assumed in connection with the closing of the MGP Transactions, (ii) the closing of the Venetian Acquisition on February 23, 2022, which included (a) the classification of the Venetian Lease as a sales-type lease, (b) the estimated future funding commitments under the Venetian PGF and (c) the sales-type sub-lease agreements that we assumed in connection with the closing of the Venetian Acquisition, and (iii) the future funding commitments from the origination of the BigShots Loan, the Cabot Citrus Farms Loan, the Great Wolf South Florida Loan, the Great Wolf Gulf Coast Texas Loan, the Canyon Ranch Austin Loan, the Great Wolf Northeast Loan and the Fontainebleau Las Vegas Loan.
Additional increases were attributable to (i) changes in the macroeconomic model used to scenario condition our reasonable and supportable period, or R&S Period, probability of default, or PD, due to uncertain and potentially negative future market conditions, (ii) an increase in the R&S Period PD of our tenants and their parent guarantors (as applicable) as a result of market volatility during the quarter and (iii) an increase in the R&S Period PD and loss given default, or LGD, as a result of standard annual updates that were made to the inputs and assumptions in the model that we utilize to estimate our CECL allowance. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the long-term reasonable and supportable period probability of default, or Long-Term Period PD, due to an upgrade of the credit rating of the senior secured debt used to determine the Long-Term Period PD for one of our tenants and as a result of standard annual updates that were made to the Long-Term Period PD default study that we utilize to estimate our CECL allowance.

58

Table of Contents
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a $19.6 million decrease in our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by (i) the decrease in the R&S Period PD of our tenants or borrowers and their parent guarantors as a result of an improvement in their economic outlook due to the reopening of all of their gaming operations and relative performance of such operations during 2021, (ii) the decrease in the Long-Term Period PD due to an upgrade of the credit rating of the senior secured debt used to determine the Long-Term Period PD for one of our tenants during 2021 and (iii) the decrease in the R&S Period PD and loss given default as a result of standard annual updates that were made to the inputs and assumptions in the model that we utilize to estimate our CECL allowance. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the existing amortized cost balances subject to the CECL allowance. Refer to Note 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses for further details.
Transaction and Acquisition Expenses
Transaction and acquisition costs increased $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 driven primarily by increases in costs incurred for the MGP Transactions and Venetian Acquisition during the period that are not capitalized under GAAP. Such balances also includes costs incurred for investments that we are no longer pursuing, the amounts of which fluctuate depending on volume and timing of such non-pursuit.
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our non-operating income and expenses were comprised of the following items:

------------------------------------ --------- ------ ---- --------- -------- - --------- - ------
(In thousands) 2022 2021 Variance
Income from unconsolidated affiliate $ 59,769 $ — $ 59,769
Interest expense (539,953) (392,390) (147,563)
Interest income 9,530 120 9,410
Loss from extinguishment of debt — (15,622) 15,622

Income from Unconsolidated Affiliate
Income from unconsolidated affiliate during the year ended December 31, 2022 represents our 50.1% share of the income of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV for the period of ownership, which interest was acquired as part of the MGP Transactions on April 29, 2022. The income from unconsolidated affiliate includes the amortization of certain basis differences arising from the differences between our purchase price and the underlying carrying value of the joint venture. As the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV interest was acquired by us on April 29, 2022, no such income was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to year-end, on January 9, 2023, we purchased BREIT’s 49.9% share of interest in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV and, accordingly, we will consolidate the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV entity in future periods, upon which such income will be presented on a consolidated basis as part of our leasing income.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $147.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily related to the increase in debt from the (i) issuance of the April 2022 Notes, (ii) issuance of the Exchange Notes and (iii) assumption of the MGP OP Notes, the combination of which resulted in an additional $9.2 billion in notional amount of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.70%, net of the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks. Further increases were related to (i) the amortization of the commitment fees associated with the bridge facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition of the Venetian Resort and the MGP Transactions, (ii) the commitment fees on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, and (iii) additional interest on the $600.0 million draw on the Revolving Credit Facility in February 2022 (which was repaid in full on April 29, 2022).
The increases were partially offset by the full repayment of the Term Loan B Facility in September 2021 and certain non-recurring activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included (i) the $64.2 million payment in connection with the early settlement of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements and (ii) the amortization of the commitment fees associated with the Venetian Acquisition Bridge Facility and the MGP Transactions Bridge Facility.
Additionally, the weighted average annualized interest rate of our debt, net of the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, increased to 4.39% during the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.04% during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of a higher weighted average effective interest rate on the April 2022 Notes, Exchange Notes and MGP OP Notes as compared to our outstanding debt during such prior period.

59

Table of Contents
Interest Income
Interest income increased $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in the interest rates and income earned on our excess cash and short-term investments, coupled with an overall increase in our cash on hand throughout the current year as compared to the prior year.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $15.6 million resulting from the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with the full repayment of our Term Loan B Facility in September 2021. No such loss was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022 and incorporated by reference herein.
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
We present VICI’s Funds From Operations (“FFO”), FFO per share, Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”), AFFO per share, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). We believe FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of VICI’s business.
FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), we define FFO as VICI’s net income (or loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, (ii) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) VICI’s proportionate share of such adjustments from its investment in unconsolidated affiliate.
AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate VICI’s performance. We calculate VICI’s AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO non-cash leasing and financing adjustments, non-cash change in allowance for credit losses, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations), capital expenditures (which are comprised of additions to property, plant and equipment related to our golf course operations), impairment charges related to non-depreciable real estate, gains (or losses) on debt extinguishment and interest rate swap settlements, other non-recurring non-cash transactions, our proportionate share of non-cash adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate (including the amortization of any basis differences) with respect to certain of the foregoing and non-cash adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest with respect to certain of the foregoing.
We calculate VICI’s Adjusted EBITDA by adding or subtracting from AFFO contractual interest expense (including the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks) and interest income (collectively, interest expense, net), income tax expense and our proportionate share of such adjustments from VICI’s investment in unconsolidated affiliate.
These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent VICI’s cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to VICI’s net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to VICI’s cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders, to fund capital improvements, or to make interest payments on our indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including REITs, due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of VICI’s financial results in accordance with GAAP.

(1)In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility includes the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $1.0 billion to the extent that any one or more lenders (from the syndicate or otherwise) agree to provide such additional credit extensions.
(2)Subsequent to year-end, on January 3, 2023, we drew on the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of C$140.0 million (approximately US$103.4 million based on the exchange rate at the time of the acquisition) to fund a portion of the purchase price of the PURE Canadian Gaming Acquisition.
(3)Subsequent to year-end, in January 2023 we physically settled the November 2022 Forward Sale Agreements and the then outstanding shares under the ATM Forward Sale Agreements in exchange for total net proceeds of approximately $1,272.2 million, which were used to pay for a portion of the purchase price of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition.
(4)Subsequent to year-end, on January 12, 2023, we completed a primary offering of 30,302,500 shares of common stock (inclusive of 3,952,500 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common stock) at a public offering price of $33.00 per share for an aggregate offering value of $1,000.0 million, Such amount is not included in the table above and we did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock in the offering, which were sold to the underwriters by the forward purchasers or their respective affiliates and remain subject to settlement in accordance with the terms of the January 2023 Forward Sale Agreements.
(5)Amounts exclude the capacity under the Delayed Draw Term Loan as the ability to use the commitments expired on February 8, 2023, and no amounts were drawn upon prior to expiration.
We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our material cash requirements, including our contractual obligations and commitments as well as our additional funding requirements, primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash received under our Lease Agreements, existing borrowings from banks, including our undrawn capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from future issuances of debt and equity securities (including issuances under any future “at-the-market” program) for the next 12 months and in future periods.
All of the Lease Agreements call for an initial term of between fifteen and thirty years with additional tenant renewal options and are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable long-term revenue stream. Our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, sustained rising interest rates, equity market volatility, changes in consumer behavior and spending and the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to, among other things, current or future adverse economic conditions. See “Overview — Impact of Material Trends on our Business” above for additional detail. In the event our tenants are unable to make all of their contractual rent payments as provided by the Lease Agreements, we believe we have sufficient liquidity from the other sources discussed above to meet all of our contractual obligations for a significant period of time. Additionally, we do not have any debt maturities until May 2024. For more information, refer to the risk factors incorporated by reference into Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other third-party sources of capital in the future will be dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions, general market conditions for REITs and investment grade issuers, market perceptions, the trading price of our stock and uncertainties related to the macroeconomic environment. We will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time, but financing available through the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive, or at all.

Additional Funding Requirements
In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have and may enter into additional agreements that commit us to potentially acquire properties in the future, fund future property improvements or otherwise provide capital to our tenants, borrowers and other counterparties, including through our put-call agreements and Partner Property Growth Fund. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 billion of potential future funding commitments under our Partner Property Growth Fund agreements, the use of which are at the sole discretion of our tenants and will be dependent upon independent decisions made by our tenants with respect to any capital improvement projects and the source of funds for such projects, as well as the total funding ultimately provided under such arrangements.
Cash Flow Analysis

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that have a significant level of estimation uncertainty, requiring our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and significantly impacts the Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations in the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a full discussion of our accounting policies.
Purchase Accounting
Our property acquisitions are accounted for under ASC 805 - Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), which requires that we allocate the purchase price of our properties to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as applicable. Our acquired properties generally meet the definition of an asset acquisition under ASC 805-50 and we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of capitalizable transaction costs, to (i) land, (ii) building and improvements and (iii) site improvements, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values using industry standard practices such as market comparables and the cost approach. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties, and in certain cases investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is based on the (a) asset quality and location, (b) property and lease-level operating performance and (c) supply and demand dynamics of each property’s respective market. In addition, any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values.
Such allocations use significant estimates which can impact the determination of the accounting as a business combination or asset acquisition and the allocation to the differing components of an acquisition. Management uses industry standard practices to estimate the value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, including the value assigned to each property, the liabilities assumed, as applicable, and the land and building property components within each property. Although management believes its estimate of both the value assigned to each property and to the land and building property components within each property is reasonable, no assurance can be given that such amounts will be correct. In particular, a change in the estimates could have a material impact on the business combination determination and the timing and amount of income recognized over the life of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Lease Accounting
We account for our investments in leases under ASC 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”), which requires significant estimates and judgments by management in its application. Upon lease inception or lease modification, we assess the lease classification of both the land and building components of the property to determine whether each component should be classified as a direct financing, sales-type or operating lease. The determination of lease classification requires the calculation of the rate implicit in the lease, which is driven by significant estimates, including the estimation of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition (as further described in “—Purchase Accounting” above) and the estimation of the unguaranteed residual value of such components at the end of the non-cancelable lease term. If the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or sales-type lease, revenue is recognized over the life of the lease using the rate implicit in the lease.
Management uses industry standard practices to estimate both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components, including comparable sales and replacement cost analyses. Although management believes its estimate of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components is reasonable, no assurance can be given that such amounts will be correct. In particular a change in the estimates could have a material impact on the lease classification determination and the timing and amount of income recognized over the life of the lease.
Allowance for Credit Losses
ASC 326 requires that we measure and record current expected credit losses (“CECL”) for the majority of our investments, the scope of which includes our Investments in leases - sales-type, Investments in leases - financing receivables and Investments in loans. We have elected to use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the Allowance for credit losses, or CECL allowance. This model requires us to develop cash flows which project estimated credit losses over the life of the lease or loan and discount these cash flows at the asset’s effective interest rate. We then record a CECL allowance equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the present value of the expected credit loss cash flows.
Expected losses within our cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) of our tenants and their parent guarantors over the life of each individual lease or financial asset. The PD and LGD are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period for which we believe we are able to estimate future economic conditions

66

Table of Contents
(the “R&S Period”) and a long-term period for which we revert to long-term historical averages (the “Long-Term Period”). We are unable to use our historical data to estimate losses as we have no loss history to date.
Given the length of our leases, the Long-Term Period PD and LGD are the most material and significant drivers of the CECL allowance. The PD and LGD for the Long-Term Period are estimated using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates, respectively, of public companies over the past 40 years that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to our tenants and their parent guarantors. We have engaged a nationally recognized data analytics firm to assist us with estimating both the PD and LGD of our tenants and their parent guarantors. Changes to the Long-Term Period PD and LGD are generally driven by (i) updated studies from the nationally recognized data analytics firm we employ to assist us with calculating the allowance and (ii) changes in the credit rating assigned to our tenants and their parent guarantors.
The following table illustrates the impact on the CECL allowance of our investment portfolio as a result of a 10% increase and decrease in the weighted average percentages used to estimate Long-Term PD and LGD of all of our tenants and their parent guarantors:

---------------- -------------------------- - -------------------------- - -------------------------- -------------------------- ------ - - --------
($ in thousands) Long-Term PD Long-Term LGD
Change Change in CECL Allowance % Change in CECL Allowance $ Change in CECL Allowance % Change in CECL Allowance $
10% increase 0.18 % $ 68,648 0.22 % $ 81,558
10% decrease (0.20) % $ (70,821) (0.22) % $ (81,558)

Although management believes its estimate of the Long-Term PD and LGD described above is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the Long-Term PD and LGD for our tenants, or other drivers of the CECL allowance, will be correct. Any significant variation of Long-Term PD or LGD from management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.
