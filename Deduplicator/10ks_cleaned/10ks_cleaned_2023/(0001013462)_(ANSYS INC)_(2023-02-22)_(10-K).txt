ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This section generally discusses our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For discussion and analysis of our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our 2021 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022.
Business
Ansys, a corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including high-tech, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, industrial equipment, materials and chemicals, consumer products, healthcare and construction. Headquartered south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we employed 5,600 people as of December 31, 2022. We focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs on-premises and/or via the cloud, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing, validation and deployment. We distribute our suite of simulation technologies through direct sales offices in strategic, global locations and a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners). It is our intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model. We operate and report as one segment.
Our strategy of Pervasive Insights seeks to deepen the use of simulation in our core market, to inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle and extend the accessibility to a broader set of users and use cases. Our business has three vectors of growth:
•More products. Our broad and deep multiphysics portfolio enables us to grow with customers as they use simulation to solve more complex problems across a broad set of industries.
•More users. Investments in simulation education and user experience simplification has made simulation more accessible to a broader user base.
•More computations. Larger and more complex simulations drive more computation, requiring customers to use more Ansys licenses to complete their simulations.
Through decades of investments in the academic community and enhanced user experiences, our solutions have become accessible and relevant beyond our core "engineering" end user, to reach more users upstream and downstream from our core, which is the product validation process. Our multiphysics solutions enable our customers to address increasingly complex R&D challenges from the component through the system and mission level of analysis. Our products seamlessly enable access to high performance compute capacity to run simulations, on-premises or in the cloud, which means our customers' R&D teams are unencumbered by compute capacity limitations that can hinder R&D cycle times.
The engineering software simulation market is strong and growing. The market growth is driven by customers' need for rapid, quality innovation in a cost-efficient manner, enabling faster time to market for new products and lower warranty costs. Increasing product complexity is driving sustained demand for simulations. Key industry trends fueling customers' increasing needs for simulation include:
•Electrification;
•Autonomy;
•Connectivity;
•IIoT; and
•Sustainability, including minimizing waste and physical prototyping, and improving circularity and development time.
We have been investing and intend to continue to invest in our portfolio to broaden the range of physics and enable customers to analyze the interactions among physics at the component, system and mission level. Our strategy is aligned with the near-term market growth opportunities and is laying the foundation for a future where simulation can be further democratized to broader classes of end-users and end-use cases.
To augment our organic development roadmaps, we intend to continue our strategic and disciplined acquisition strategy to grow our business. Our strategy is to partner with industry leaders to extend simulation into other ecosystems and customer R&D

workflows. Our business is built on a culture of high ethical standards and commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.
We license our technology to businesses in a diverse set of industries, educational institutions and governmental agencies. We believe that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. The software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles which increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. We make many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. As a result, we believe that our overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. Please see the sub-section entitled "Company Operational Risks" under Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the potential impact of our sales forecasts on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.
We address the competition and price pressure that we face in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increasing the capabilities of our existing products; maintaining a diverse industry footprint and focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. We also evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
Overview
Overall GAAP and Non-GAAP Results
This section includes a discussion of GAAP and Non-GAAP results. For reconciliations of Non-GAAP results to GAAP results, see the section titled "Non-GAAP Results" herein.
The non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected the following variances:

-------------------------- ---------------------------- - -------- --- -
 Year Ended December 31, 2022
 GAAP Non-GAAP
Revenue 8.3 % 7.3 %
Operating income 15.5 % 8.8 %
Diluted earnings per share 16.1 % 8.4 %

Our results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to growth in maintenance, subscription lease license and service revenue, partially offset by a reduction in perpetual license revenue. We also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased personnel costs. The actual U.S. Dollar reported results were significantly impacted by a stronger U.S. Dollar.
This section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure. All constant currency results presented in this Item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2022 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2021 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2022. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2022 reported amounts by the 2022 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2021 comparable period reported amounts.

Impact of Foreign Currency
Our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The impacts on our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2021 exchange rates are reflected in the table below. Amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

Operating income 27.9 % 17.1 %

Other Key Business Metric
Annual Contract Value (ACV) is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:

•the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus

•the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus

•the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus

•the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.

When we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2022, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2025, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.

Example 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2022 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2023.

Example 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2025 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.

Example 3: A perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2022 would contribute $200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2022.

Recurring ACV includes both subscription lease license and maintenance ACV and excludes perpetual license and service ACV.
Industry Commentary
For 2022, ACV growth was broad based across all industries. Our core industries of high-tech, aerospace and defense (A&D) and automotive experienced strong growth as demand from our customers for more simulation products, users and computations continued to drive the need to accelerate innovation and overcome engineering challenges stemming from increasingly complex products. In high-tech, customers continued to push the boundaries of electronics and semiconductor performance. The breadth, depth and accuracy of our portfolio remained a key factor in winning new accounts and growing existing accounts. Digital transformation remains a key initiative in the A&D industry. The integration of our core solvers into our digital mission engineering solutions, as well as our model-based system engineering tool, allowed us to further entrench ourselves within key customers. The automotive industry's initiatives around electrification, connectivity and driver-assist technology continued to support investments in our solutions. The industrial equipment and energy industries also had strong performance as companies use our solutions for their sustainability and digital transformation initiatives. Additionally, the healthcare industry had strong growth as we continued to see companies mature digital engineering efforts as they expand engineering staff and Digital Twin/Digital Engineering initiatives in areas such as surgery and implantable devices.
Geographic Trends
The following table presents our GAAP and non-GAAP geographic revenue variances using actual and constant currency rates during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021:

------------ ---------------------------- - ----------------- ---- ------ ----------------- - ---- -
 Year Ended December 31, 2022
 GAAP Non-GAAP
 Actual Constant Currency Actual Constant Currency
Americas 7.4 % 7.6 % 5.5 % 5.7 %
EMEA 5.8 % 16.1 % 5.6 % 15.9 %
Asia-Pacific 12.8 % 24.6 % 12.5 % 24.3 %
Total 8.3 % 14.2 % 7.3 % 13.2 %

Revenue results from region to region can fluctuate due to the timing, duration and size of multi-year lease subscriptions contracts in any particular period and are not necessarily indicative of the underlying operational performance. To drive growth, we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, trade restrictions limited our ability to deliver products and services to customers in Russia and Belarus and certain entities in China. For context, the combined 2021 revenue for all customers in Russia and Belarus was $15.1 million, less than 1% of our total 2021 revenue.
On October 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security announced new restrictions targeting the sales of semiconductor products into China. We expect the impact of those restrictions to be immaterial on our business. As a reference, our semiconductor business in China over the last twelve months represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenue and China's total contribution to revenue for the same period was 4.7%.
Additional restrictions or a further deterioration in the global trade environment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Refer to additional details in Part I, Item 1A. herein, for a discussion of additional business risks, including those associated with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 8.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, or 14.2% in constant currency. Maintenance revenue growth of 12.1%, or 18.3% in constant currency, is correlated with the license sales discussed later in this paragraph and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. The reported $108.2 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a $98.1 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses and a $10.1 million increase in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. Subscription lease license revenue increased 11.3%, or 17.9% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, with substantially all of the increase attributable to additional sales to our existing customers. The reported $70.0 million increase in lease license revenue was attributable to a $53.5 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a $16.5 million increase in value from annual licenses. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived from new sales during the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased 8.2%, or 4.1% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Driving the decrease in perpetual license revenue was a 9.2% decrease in volume of deals, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in average deal size.
With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2022, the U.S. Dollar was 11.4% stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2021. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

As a percentage of revenue, our international and domestic revenues, and our direct and indirect revenues, were as follows:

------------- ----------------------- - ---- ---- -
 Year Ended December 31,
 2022 2021
International 54.9 % 54.5 %
Domestic 45.1 % 45.5 %

Direct 76.1 % 76.3 %
Indirect 23.9 % 23.7 %

In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of our acquisitions that closed prior to 2022 as of their respective acquisition dates, we applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to the historical carrying amount. As a result, our post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by us and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impacts on reported revenue were $7.3 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Software Licenses: The decrease in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to decreased third-party royalties of $4.7 million.
Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.
Maintenance and Service: The net decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•Decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of $7.3 million due to a stronger U.S. Dollar.
•Decreased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $3.0 million.
•Decreased stock-based compensation of $2.3 million.
•Increased consulting and professional fees of $1.8 million.
•Increased third-party technical support of $1.4 million.
The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue.

Selling, General and Administrative: The net increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:
•Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $44.6 million.
•Increased business travel of $11.7 million as in-person meetings and live attendance at trade events have continued to expand.
•Increased bad debt expense of $5.2 million due to the write-off of receivables due from Russian customers as a result of sanctions imposed related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increased risk associated with receivables from specific customers in China.
•Increased marketing expenses of $5.1 million.
•Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of $4.6 million.
•Increased third-party commissions of $4.5 million.
•Decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of $27.4 million due to a stronger U.S. Dollar.
We anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenue-generating activities.
Research and Development: The net increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•Increased salaries and incentive compensation of $25.3 million.
•Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of $3.6 million.
•Increased business travel of $3.6 million as in-person meetings and live attendance at trade events have continued to expand.
•Increased stock-based compensation of $2.8 million.
•Decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of $11.6 million due to a stronger U.S. Dollar.
We have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intend to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products.
Overall, the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Interest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $5.7 million as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The higher interest rate environment and the related increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances was partially offset by a lower invested cash balance as a result of investments in acquisitions and share repurchases.

The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to a benefit of $22.8 million related to U.S. tax benefits on foreign earnings due to entity structuring activities, an $11.8 million increase in the benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and $8.7 million of tax benefits related to Extraterritorial Income Exclusions from prior periods. These benefits were partially offset by decreased deductions of $18.8 million related to stock-based compensation.
When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the FDII deduction and research and development credits, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation.

We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.
The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. Under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. Although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related subscription leases and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.
Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.
Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the

41

Table of Contents
effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we have updated this non-GAAP measure to include, in addition to professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. The additional expenses were not material in the current or prior year period. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:

-------------------------- -----------------------------------
GAAP Reporting Measure Non-GAAP Reporting Measure
Revenue Non-GAAP Revenue
Gross Profit Non-GAAP Gross Profit
Gross Profit Margin Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin
Operating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income
Operating Profit Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin
Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income
Diluted Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share

Constant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2022 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2021 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2022. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2022 reported amounts by the 2022 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2021 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year. The following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:

Foreign 287,790 46.8 302,638 45.3
Total $ 614,574 $ 668,028

In general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. Substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. These taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. Unrecognized provisions for taxes on indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be significant.
The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities

 Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2022 2021 Change
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 631,003 $ 549,482 $ 81,521

Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $76.3 million and increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $5.2 million. The growth in net cash provided by operating activities was a result of increased customer receipts driven primarily by ACV growth and lower income tax payments due to timing, partially offset by additional cash outflows related to increased operating expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities

------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- ------ --------- - -------
 Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2022 2021 Change
Net cash used in investing activities $ (411,368) $ (536,813) $ 125,445

Net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $124.5 million, partially offset by increased capital expenditures of $1.4 million. We currently plan capital spending of $28.0 million to $38.0 million during fiscal year 2023 as compared to the $24.4 million that was spent in fiscal year 2022. The level of spending will depend on various factors, including the growth of the business and general economic conditions.

 Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2022 2021 Change
Net cash used in financing activities $ (245,508) $ (245,852) $ 344

Net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly during the current fiscal year primarily due to decreased principal payments on long-term debt of $45.0 million and decreased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of $32.8 million, offset by increased stock repurchases of $70.9 million.
Other Cash Flow Information

On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association as administrative agent, swing line lender, and an L/C issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other L/C issuers party thereto. The 2022 Credit Agreement refinanced our previous credit agreements in their entirety. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a $755.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $500.0 million unsecured revolving loan facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Terms used in this description of the 2022 Credit Agreement with initial capital letters that are not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement.

The term loan facility was advanced by the lenders thereunder to refinance and replace our prior credit agreements.
As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our term loans was $753.6 million, with no principal payments due in the next twelve months. Borrowings under the term loan and revolving loan facilities accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). The rate in effect for the first quarter of 2023 under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 5.56%.
We previously entered into operating lease commitments, primarily for our domestic and international offices. The commitments related to these operating leases is $151.2 million, of which $26.6 million is due in the next twelve months.
Under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares as follows:

------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- --- - -------
 Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021
Number of shares repurchased 725 347
Average price paid per share $ 283.38 $ 388.35
Total cost $ 205,571 $ 134,679

As of December 31, 2022, 1.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
The authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
We continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business; acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies; and make payments on our outstanding debt balances. Any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, debt financing or the issuance of additional securities. Additionally, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital, in excess of our requirements, to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value.
In January 2023, we had a $120.7 million cash outflow (net of cash acquired) associated with a strategic acquisition.

Table of Contents
We believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to the $500.0 million revolving loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and contractual obligations through at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. However, future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
Contractual and Other Obligations
Our significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 are summarized below:

(1)Borrowings under long-term debt accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). As the interest rate is variable, interest on the long-term debt is estimated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2022. For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2)We previously entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which serves as our headquarters. The term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on October 1, 2014 and expiring on December 31, 2029. We have a one-time right to terminate the lease on December 31, 2025 by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.
(3)Other operating leases primarily include lease commitments for our other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(4)Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include minimum royalty contracts, software licenses and support, and network services, which are unrecorded as of December 31, 2022. The unconditional purchase obligations are in addition to the current and long-term liabilities recorded on our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet.
(5)We have $54.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. As a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.

Critical Accounting Estimates
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The most critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing our consolidated financial statements involved:
•Revenue recognition;
•Valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; and
•Income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
Description
Our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.
Judgments and Estimates
Our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.
Our time-based subscription lease license contracts with customers are sold as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license as well as post-contract support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software lease license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the PCS in the arrangement. Utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term software license, while 50% is attributable to PCS. This determination involved judgment, particularly as it relates to the value relationship between our PCS and subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and our perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a subscription lease license, the average economic life of our software, renewal rates of our customers and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach.
Changes in these estimates could significantly impact the recognition of revenue in a given period.
Valuation of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations
Description
In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.

46

Table of Contents
Judgments and Estimates
Determining these fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to acquired intangible assets. We determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. These models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: royalty rate, discount rate and customer attrition rate. The fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives.
If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our business acquisitions.
Income Taxes
Description
Our income tax expense reflects management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
Additionally, as part of our accounting for income taxes, tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open.
Judgments and Estimates
We are subject to tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgements and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgement and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. In the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We adjust the liabilities when our judgement changes as a result of new information not previously available.
Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

[section entitled "Company Operational Risks"]:
We are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue and usage of channel partners presents certain heightened compliance risks. We distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners, which accounted for 23.9%, 23.7% and 22.2% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support. In the APAC and EMEA regions, we are highly dependent upon our channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships, could adversely affect our performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner, including a channel partner's decision to sell competing products rather than ours, could result in reduced revenue. Moreover, our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to understand and promote our expanding portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions. If the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so, we may be unable to sustain revenue growth. The business relationships with many of our channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us. In addition, these channel partners have a less-established payment history and revenue from these channel partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense. Where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts, failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in liability to us for any fines, civil suits or non-financial p...

We address the competition and price pressure that we face in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increasing the capabilities of our existing products; maintaining a diverse industry footprint and focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. We also evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
Overview
Overall GAAP and Non-GAAP Results
This section includes a discussion of GAAP and Non-GAAP results. For reconciliations of Non-GAAP results to GAAP results, see the section titled "]:
Item 1A. Risk Factors 20

[" herein.
The non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected the following variances:

-------------------------- ---------------------------- - -------- --- -
 Year Ended December 31, 2022
 GAAP Non-GAAP
Revenue 8.3 % 7.3 %
Operating income 15.5 % 8.8 %
Diluted earnings per share 16.1 % 8.4 %

Our results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to growth in maintenance, subscription lease license and service revenue, partially offset by a reduction in perpetual license revenue. We also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased personnel costs. The actual U.S. Dollar reported results were significantly impacted by a stronger U.S. Dollar.
This section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure. All constant currency results presented in this Item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2022 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2021 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2022. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2022 reported amounts by the 2022 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2021 comparable period reported amounts.

Impact of Foreign Currency
Our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The impacts on our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2021 exchange rates are reflected in the table below. Amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

Other Key Business Metric
Annual Contract Value (ACV) is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:

•the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus

•the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus

•the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus

•the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.

When we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2022, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2025, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.

Example 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2023, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2022 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2023.

Example 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2025 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.

Example 3: A perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2022 would contribute $200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2022.

Industry Commentary
For 2022, ACV growth was broad based across all industries. Our core industries of high-tech, aerospace and defense (A&D) and automotive experienced strong growth as demand from our customers for more simulation products, users and computations continued to drive the need to accelerate innovation and overcome engineering challenges stemming from increasingly complex products. In high-tech, customers continued to push the boundaries of electronics and semiconductor performance. The breadth, depth and accuracy of our portfolio remained a key factor in winning new accounts and growing existing accounts. Digital transformation remains a key initiative in the A&D industry. The integration of our core solvers into our digital mission engineering solutions, as well as our model-based system engineering tool, allowed us to further entrench ourselves within key customers.

Critical Accounting Estimates
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The most critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing our consolidated financial statements involved:
•Revenue recognition;
•Valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; and
•Income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
Description
Our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.
Judgments and Estimates
Our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.
Our time-based subscription lease license contracts with customers are sold as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license as well as post-contract support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software lease license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the PCS in the arrangement. Utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term software license, while 50% is attributable to PCS. This determination involved judgment, particularly as it relates to the value relationship between our PCS and subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and our perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a subscription lease license, the average economic life of our software, renewal rates of our customers and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach.
Changes in these estimates could significantly impact the recognition of revenue in a given period.
Valuation of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations
Description
In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.

46

Table of Contents
Judgments and Estimates
Determining these fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to acquired intangible assets. We determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. These models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: royalty rate, discount rate and customer attrition rate. The fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives.
If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our business acquisitions.
Income Taxes

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023.
