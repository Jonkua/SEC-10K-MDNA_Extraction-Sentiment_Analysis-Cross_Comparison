ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our discussion of results includes discussion of our ARR (Annual Run Rate) operating measure, non-GAAP financial measures, and disclosure of our results on a constant currency basis. ARR and our non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons we use those measures, are described below in Results of Operations - Operating Measure and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures, respectively. The methodology used to calculate constant currency disclosures is described in Results of Operations - Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange on Results of Operations. You should read those sections to understand our operating measure, non-GAAP financial measures, and constant currency disclosures.

Executive Overview

ARR grew 26% (23% constant currency) to $1.98 billion as of the end of FY'23 compared to FY’22. Organic ARR, which excludes contributions from the ServiceMax business we acquired in Q2'23, grew 15% (13% constant currency) year over year to $1.81 billion. Organic ARR growth was driven by double-digit growth across all product groups and geographies.

We generated $611 million of cash from operations in FY’23 compared to $435 million in FY’22, an increase of 40%. Free cash flow of $587 million in FY'23 increased 41% from $416 million in FY'22. Our cash flow growth is attributable to strong collections driven by our solid top-line growth from our subscription business model and operational discipline. Interest payments were $41 million higher in FY'23 compared to FY'22, while restructuring payments decreased $39 million year-over-year. We ended FY’23 with cash and cash equivalents of $288 million and gross debt of $1.70 billion, with an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 5.2%.

Revenue growth of 8% (12% constant currency) in FY'23 compared to FY'22 was primarily due to the contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. The timing of revenue recognition for on-premises subscription revenue can vary significantly, impacting reported revenue and growth rates. Interest expense was $75 million higher in FY'23 compared to FY'22, which adversely affected our net income and earnings per share results. The increase was driven by debt and liabilities related to the ServiceMax acquisition.

Results of Operations

The following table shows the measures that we consider the most significant indicators of our business performance. In addition to providing operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and cash from operations as calculated under GAAP, we provide our ARR operating measure and non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow for the reported periods. We also provide a view of our actual results on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the items described in Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Investors should use our non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with our GAAP results.

Cash flow from operations for FY'23 and FY'22 includes $1.5 million and $40.8 million of restructuring payments, respectively. Cash from operations for FY'23 and FY'22 includes $19.6 million and $11.8 million of acquisition and transaction-related payments, respectively.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange on Results of Operations

Approximately 50% of our revenue and 35% of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because we report our results of operations in U.S. Dollars, currency translation, particularly changes in the Euro, Yen, Shekel, and Rupee relative to the U.S. Dollar, affects our reported results. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to reported income statement results in FY’23. However, ARR was positively impacted by improvements in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, as of September 30, 2023 compared to September 30, 2022.

 The results of operations in the table above, and the tables and discussions below about revenue by line of business and product group present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis. Our constant currency disclosures are calculated by multiplying the results in local currency for FY'23 and FY'22 by the exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2022. If FY'23 reported results were converted into U.S. Dollars using the rates in effect as of September 30, 2022, ARR would have been lower by $38 million, revenue would have been lower by $59 million, and expenses would have been lower by $26 million. If FY'22 reported results were converted into U.S. Dollars using the rates in effect as of September 30, 2022, ARR would have been the same, revenue would have been lower by $112 million, and expenses would have been lower by $50 million.

Revenue

Under ASC 606, the volume, mix, and duration of contract types (support, SaaS, on-premises subscription) starting or renewing in any given period can have a material impact on revenue in the period, and as a result can impact the comparability of reported revenue period over period. We recognize revenue for the license portion of on-premises subscription contracts up front when we deliver the licenses to the customer, typically on the start date, and we recognize revenue on the support portion of on-premises subscription contracts and stand-alone support contracts ratably over the term. We continue to convert existing perpetual support contracts to on-premises subscriptions, resulting in a shift to up-front recognition of on-premises subscription license revenue in the period converted compared to ratable recognition for a perpetual support contract. Revenue from our cloud services (primarily SaaS) contracts is recognized ratably. We expect that over time a higher portion of our revenue will be recognized ratably as we continue to expand our SaaS offerings, release additional cloud functionality into our products, and migrate customers from on-premises subscriptions to SaaS. Given the different mix, duration and volume of new and renewing contracts in any period, year-over-year or sequential revenue can vary significantly.

Software revenue in FY'23 benefited from contributions from ServiceMax, acquired early in Q2'23, and Codebeamer, acquired in Q3'22. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to year-over-year revenue growth.

Within software revenue, license revenue is impacted by the quantity and size of expiring and renewing multi-year on-premises subscription contracts, along with the duration of those contracts that start in the period. In FY'23, the weighted-average duration of contracts starting in the year decreased compared to FY'22 primarily due to a few high-value renewal contracts in FY'22 that had longer than typical durations. Because longer duration contracts typically have a higher total contract value, which drives the amount of upfront license revenue recognized for on-premises contracts, this year-over-year duration decrease represented a headwind to license revenue growth in FY'23.

Professional services revenue decreased in FY'23 as we continue to execute on our strategy of leveraging partners to deliver services rather than contracting to deliver services ourselves, including the Q3'22 sale of a portion of our PLM services business to ITC Infotech (which branded the business DxP Services). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the year-over-year revenue decline. These decreases were partially offset by ServiceMax professional services revenue.

Our expectation is that professional services revenue will continue to trend down over time as we execute on our partner strategy and deliver products that require less consulting and training services.

Software revenue $ 1,946.6 $ 1,770.3 10 % 13 %

PLM software revenue growth in FY'23 benefited from contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding contributions from ServiceMax and Codebeamer, constant currency revenue growth was driven by Windchill and IIoT in the Americas.

PLM ARR grew 36% (34% constant currency) from Q4’22 to Q4'23, driven by ServiceMax, which contributed $171 million of ARR; Windchill; IIoT; and Codebeamer.

CAD software revenue was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency revenue growth was flat due to decreases in Creo revenue in Europe due to shorter durations of on-premises subscription contracts, offset by Creo revenue growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific.

CAD ARR grew 12% (10% constant currency) in FY'23 compared to FY'22, driven by Creo.

Non-GAAP gross margin percentage(1) 82 % 83 %

(1) Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to GAAP results under Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

License gross margin decreased in FY’23 compared to FY’22 due to lower license revenue and higher royalty expense.

Support and cloud services gross margin increased in FY’23 compared to FY’22 due to higher support and cloud services revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of support and cloud services, which were driven by higher royalty expenses, compensation costs, higher intangible amortization expense due to the ServiceMax acquisition, and cloud hosting costs.

Table of Contents

Professional services gross margin decreased in FY’23 compared to FY’22 due to lower professional services revenue, offset by lower professional services costs. The decrease in professional services revenue is mainly due to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business in FY'22 and continued execution on our strategy of leveraging partners to deliver services rather than contracting to deliver services ourselves.

Total headcount increased by 11% between FY'22 and FY'23, primarily driven by our acquisition of ServiceMax.

Operating expenses in FY'23 compared to FY'22 increased primarily due to the following:

•
a $90 million increase in compensation expense (including stock-based compensation and benefit costs), primarily due to our acquisition of ServiceMax;

•
a $12 million increase in marketing expense, primarily due to our Q3'23 LiveWorx event;

•
an $11 million increase in software subscriptions and internal hosting costs;

•
a $10 million increase in travel expenses;

partially offset by:

•
a $38 million decrease in restructuring charges, primarily due to the restructuring plan initiated and substantially completed in FY'22.

Interest and debt premium expense $ (129.4 ) $ (54.3 ) 138 %

Interest expense includes interest on our revolving credit facility and term loan, our Senior Notes due 2025 and 2028, and imputed interest on the deferred payment of a portion of the ServiceMax purchase price. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher total debt and higher interest rates in FY'23 compared to FY'22, as well as $30 million of imputed interest associated with the ServiceMax deferred acquisition payment.

Other Income

Other income, net $ 3.5 $ 4.0 (13 )%

Other income (expense), net in FY'23 was related to foreign currency exchange losses. Other income (expense), net in FY’22 included $36 million of recognized gains from the sale of assets, primarily related to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business, offset by a $35 million loss associated with an equity investment in a publicly traded company.

Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes 87.0 84.0 4 %
Effective income tax rate 26 % 21 %

The effective tax rate for FY’23 was higher than the effective rate for FY’22, primarily due to tax expense of $21.8 million related to an uncertain tax position regarding transfer pricing in a foreign jurisdiction where we are currently under audit. Our rate was also impacted by tax expense of $6.3 million related to non-deductible imputed interest related to the deferred payment on the acquisition of ServiceMax Inc. Additionally, in FY'22, our rate included $8.1 million of tax expense arising from the basis difference on goodwill related to the sale of a portion of our PLM services business.

In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the IRS in the United States. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions including Germany, Ireland, and Italy. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses, and tax credits.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

We invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

A significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside the U.S. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35 million in the U.S., $111 million in Europe, $121 million in Asia Pacific (including India), and $21 million in other non-U.S. countries. We have substantial cash requirements in the U.S., but believe that the combination of our existing U.S. cash and cash equivalents, our ability to repatriate cash to the U.S., future U.S. operating cash flows, and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing U.S. operating expenses and known capital requirements.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities increased by $175.6 million in FY'23 compared to FY'22. This increase was driven by higher collections, including contributions from ServiceMax, offset by higher vendor disbursements and higher interest payments due to a higher debt burden and higher interest rates. Cash from operations in FY'23 includes $1.5 million of restructuring payments and $19.6 million of acquisition and transaction-related payments compared to $40.8 million of restructuring payments and $11.8 million of acquisition and transaction-related payments in FY'22.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in FY'23 was driven by the acquisition of ServiceMax, with $828.2 million paid in Q2'23. Cash used in investing activities in FY'22 was driven by the acquisition of the Codebeamer business for $278.1 million, offset by $46.9 million of proceeds from the sale of an investment and $32.5 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of our PLM services business.

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

 Cash provided by financing activities in FY’23 was primarily related to net new borrowings of $771.0 million (a $500.0 million term loan and a $271.0 million incremental revolving line) to fund the ServiceMax acquisition and net repayments of $428.0 million on the new revolving facility. Cash used in financing activities in FY’22 includes repayments of $355.0 million under our credit facility and repurchases of common stock of $125.0 million, offset by borrowings of $264.0 million to fund our acquisition of the Codebeamer business.

Table of Contents

In addition to the debt shown in the above table, as of September 30, 2023, we had a $620 million deferred acquisition payment liability related to the fair value of the $650 million installment paid in October 2023 for the ServiceMax acquisition. Of the $650 million paid, $620 million has been recorded as a financing outflow and the $30 million of imputed interest has been recorded as an operating cash outflow in our Q1'24 financials. To finance this payment and the payment for the acquisition of pure-systems in Q1'24, we borrowed $740 million under the revolving line of our credit facility. This is described in Note 18. Subsequent Events of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility and the Senior Note indentures. Any failure to comply with such covenants under the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, and, as with any failure to comply with such covenants under the Senior Note indentures, could constitute a default that could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable immediately. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates which reset every 30 to 180 days. As of September 30, 2023, the annual rates for borrowings outstanding under the credit facility revolver line and term loan were both 7.2%.

Our credit facility and our Senior Notes are described in Note 9. Debt of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Expectations for 2024

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements (which we expect to be approximately $20 million in FY’24) through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known long-term capital requirements.

For the remainder of FY'24, we expect to use substantially all our cash generated from operating activities to repay debt outstanding under our credit facility revolving line.

Our expected uses and sources of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced, and we could incur additional debt obligations if we decide to retire other debt, engage in strategic transactions, or repurchase shares, any of which could be commenced, suspended, or completed at any time. Any such repurchases or retirement of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any debt retirement or issuance, share repurchases, or strategic transactions may be material.

Contractual Obligations

At September 30, 2023, our future contractual obligations were related to debt, deferred acquisition payments, leases, pension liabilities, unrecognized tax benefits, and purchase obligations. See Note 6. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses, Note 9. Debt, Note 17. Leases, Note 14. Pension Plans, and Note 8. Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for information about those obligations, which Notes are incorporated by reference into this section. Our purchase obligations were approximately $164.7 million, with $75.9 million expected to be paid in FY'24 and $88.8 million thereafter. Purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties, including royalty contracts, research and development contracts, telecommunication contracts, information technology maintenance contracts in support of internal-use software and hardware, financing leases, operating leases with original terms of less than 12 months, and other marketing and consulting contracts. Contracts for which our commitment is variable or based on volumes with no fixed minimum quantities and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties are not included in the purchase obligation amounts above. The purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in Current liabilities and Prepaid expenses recorded on our September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As of September 30, 2023, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately $13.1 million (of which $0.5 million was collateralized).

Operating Measure

ARR

ARR (Annual Run Rate) represents the annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, cloud, SaaS, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period. We calculate ARR as follows:

•
We consider a contract to be active when the product or service contractual term commences (the “start date”) until the right to use the product or service ends (the “expiration date”). Even if the contract with the customer is executed before the start date, the contract will not count toward ARR until the customer right to receive the benefit of the products or services has commenced.

•
For contracts that include annual values that increase over time, which we refer to as ramp contracts, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include any future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation.

•
As ARR includes only contracts that are active at the end of the reporting period, ARR does not reflect assumptions or estimates regarding future customer renewals or non-renewals.

•
Active contracts are annualized by dividing the total active contract value by the contract duration in days (expiration date minus start date), then multiplying that by 365 days (or 366 days for leap years).

We believe ARR is a valuable operating measure to assess the health of a subscription business because it is aligned with the amount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. We generally invoice customers annually for the current year of the contract. A customer with a one-year contract will typically be invoiced for the total value of the contract at the beginning of the contractual term, while a customer with a multi-year contract will be invoiced for each annual period at the beginning of each year of the contract.

ARR increases by the annualized value of active contracts that commence in a reporting period and decreases by the annualized value of contracts that expire in the reporting period.

 As ARR is not annualized recurring revenue, it is not calculated based on recognized or unearned revenue and is not affected by variability in the timing of revenue under ASC 606, particularly for on-premises license subscriptions where a substantial portion of the total value of the contract is recognized as revenue at a point in time upon the later of when the software is made available, or the subscription term commences.

ARR should be viewed independently of recognized and unearned revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace, either of those items. Investors should consider our ARR operating measure only in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable GAAP measures are:

•
free cash flow—cash flow from operations

•
non-GAAP gross margin—GAAP gross margin

•
non-GAAP operating income—GAAP operating income

•
non-GAAP operating margin—GAAP operating margin

26

Table of Contents

•
non-GAAP net income—GAAP net income

•
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share—GAAP diluted earnings per share

Free cash flow is cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures, which are expenditures for property and equipment and consist primarily of facility improvements, office equipment, computer equipment, and software. We believe that free cash flow, in conjunction with cash from operations, is a useful measure of liquidity since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations.

The non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow exclude, as applicable: stock-based compensation expense; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and transaction-related charges included in General and administrative expenses; restructuring and other charges (credits), net; non-operating charges (credits), net; and income tax adjustments.

The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We do not include these items, which can vary significantly from period to period, when reviewing our operating results internally because we do not consider them to be part of our core operating results. Excluding them facilitates evaluation of our ongoing performance, our earnings trends, and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our GAAP results, as should investors.

Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense relating to stock-based awards issued to executive officers, employees and outside directors, consisting of restricted stock units. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets is a non-cash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. We believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry.

Acquisition and transaction-related charges included in General and administrative expenses are direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities, including transaction fees, due diligence costs, severance and professional fees. Subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are also included within acquisition and transaction-related charges. Other transactional charges include third-party costs related to structuring merger and acquisition transactions outside of ordinary business operations. We do not include these costs when reviewing our operating results internally. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and transactions.

Restructuring and other charges (credits), net includes excess facility restructuring charges (credits); impairment and accretion expense charges related to the lease assets of exited facilities; sublease income from previously impaired facilities; severance charges resulting from reductions of personnel; and third-party professional consulting fees related to modifications of our business strategy. These costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan.

Non-operating charges (credits), net are gains or losses associated with sales or changes in value of assets or liabilities that are generally investing or financing in nature and are not indicative of our ongoing ordinary operating activities. In FY'23, we recognized a financing charge for a debt commitment agreement associated with our acquisition of ServiceMax. In FY'22, we recorded gains associated with the sale of assets, including the sale of a portion of our PLM services business, and we recorded a loss associated with the reduction in value of an equity investment in a publicly-traded company.

Income tax adjustments include the tax impact of the items above. Additionally, we exclude other material tax items that we do not include when reviewing our operating results internally. For example, in FY’23, adjustments include a charge related to an uncertain tax position in a foreign jurisdiction.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our core operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business, and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals (communicated internally and externally) for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures also affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of other companies in our industry that use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.

The items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following tables reconcile each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most closely comparable GAAP measure on our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time.

The accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. The most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved:

•
revenue recognition;

•
accounting for income taxes; and

•
valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations.

A critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting policies, guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators. These rule makers and/or regulators may promulgate interpretations, guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

We record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For a full description of our revenue accounting policy, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Our sources of revenue include: (1) subscriptions, (2) perpetual licenses, (3) support for perpetual licenses, and (4) professional services. Subscriptions include term-based on-premises licenses and related support, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and hosting services.

Judgments and Estimates

Determination of performance obligations. Our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services, typically pairing on-premises term software licenses with support and, for certain offerings, cloud services over the same term. Significant judgment is used in determining the performance obligations related to these bundled products and services. On-premises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support and cloud components. On-premises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer, while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. In cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and on-premises software, an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the on-premises software. In the substantial majority of instances, cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the on-premises software. This assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve.

Allocation of transaction price. We estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. Significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the on-premises license, support, and cloud components of our subscription products. These estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses versus support and cloud.

Right to exchange. Our multi-year, non-cancellable subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. When it applies to on-premises licenses, we account for this right as a liability. For most contracts, we use the expected value method to determine the liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts. Where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the liability for each individual contract. In both circumstances, the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates, which impacts the amount of revenue recognized. Changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period.

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. There are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; as a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. If we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities.

30

Table of Contents

The income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense.

We have unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023 of $50.7 million. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of multi-jurisdictional tax positions could be reduced by up to $26 million as audits close and statutes of limitations expire.

As of September 30, 2023, we have a valuation allowance of $17.4 million against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and a valuation allowance of $4.3 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance recorded in the U.S. relates to Massachusetts tax credit carryforwards that we do not expect to realize a benefit from prior to expiration.

The valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. However, there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits. We will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period.

Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, we asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings. We maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. unless repatriation can be done substantially tax-free, with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our Taiwan subsidiary. If we decide to repatriate any additional non-U.S. earnings in the future, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material.

In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the U.S. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of purchased software, tradenames, customer lists and contracts, and software support agreements and related relationships. Purchased software consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and the combination of processes, inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products. Customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base. We have

31

Table of Contents

generally valued intangible assets using discounted cash flow models. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to:

•
future expected revenues and costs related to software license sales, customer support agreements, customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names; and

•
discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.

In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset.

Net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations. Except for deferred revenues, net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company, if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date. For acquisitions completed prior to FY'22, the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company’s software support contracts. During FY'22, we adopted ASU 2021-08, whereby deferred revenue for acquisitions completed in FY'22 and thereafter reflect the amounts that would have been deferred as of the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606.

In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax-related valuation allowances, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment. This assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset’s remaining life. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset, determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements, we will be required to comply with certain changes in accounting rules and regulations, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated (to the extent of our ownership interest therein) into our financial statements. We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time.

The accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. The most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved:

•
revenue recognition;

•
accounting for income taxes; and

•
valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations.

A critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting policies, guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators. These rule makers and/or regulators may promulgate interpretations, guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

We record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For a full description of our revenue accounting policy, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Our sources of revenue include: (1) subscriptions, (2) perpetual licenses, (3) support for perpetual licenses, and (4) professional services. Subscriptions include term-based on-premises licenses and related support, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and hosting services.

Judgments and Estimates

Determination of performance obligations. Our subscriptions are frequently sold as a bundle of products and services, typically pairing on-premises term software licenses with support and, for certain offerings, cloud services over the same term. Significant judgment is used in determining the performance obligations related to these bundled products and services. On-premises software is typically determined to be a distinct performance obligation and is thus recognized separately from the support and cloud components. On-premises license software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer, while the support and cloud software revenue components are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. In cases where subscriptions include cloud functionality and on-premises software, an assessment has been performed to determine whether the cloud services are distinct from the on-premises software. In the substantial majority of instances, cloud services provide incremental functionality to customers and have been considered distinct and recognized separately from the on-premises software. This assessment could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition and may change as our product offerings evolve.

Allocation of transaction price. We estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. Significant judgment is used in determining the standalone selling prices of the on-premises license, support, and cloud components of our subscription products. These estimates are subject to change as our product offerings change and could have a significant impact due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises licenses versus support and cloud.

Right to exchange. Our multi-year, non-cancellable subscription contracts provide customers with an annual right to exchange software within the original subscription with other software. When it applies to on-premises licenses, we account for this right as a liability. For most contracts, we use the expected value method to determine the liability associated with this right across a portfolio of contracts. Where contracts are outside of the standard portfolio of contracts due to contract size, longer contract duration, or other unique contractual terms, we use the most likely amount method to determine the liability for each individual contract. In both circumstances, the transaction price is constrained based on our estimates, which impacts the amount of revenue recognized. Changes in these estimates could significantly impact revenue for any given period.

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. There are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; as a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. If we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our recorded tax liabilities.

Table of Contents

The income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense.

We have unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023 of $50.7 million. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of multi-jurisdictional tax positions could be reduced by up to $26 million as audits close and statutes of limitations expire.

As of September 30, 2023, we have a valuation allowance of $17.4 million against net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and a valuation allowance of $4.3 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance recorded in the U.S. relates to Massachusetts tax credit carryforwards that we do not expect to realize a benefit from prior to expiration.

The valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. However, there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such capital losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits. We will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period.

Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, we asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax and there is therefore no longer a material cumulative basis difference associated with the undistributed earnings. We maintain our assertion to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. unless repatriation can be done substantially tax-free, with the exception of a foreign holding company formed in 2018 and our Taiwan subsidiary. If we decide to repatriate any additional non-U.S. earnings in the future, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings would not be material.

In the normal course of business, PTC and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the U.S. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. Audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, transfer pricing, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of purchased software, tradenames, customer lists and contracts, and software support agreements and related relationships. Purchased software consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and the combination of processes, inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products. Customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company’s installed base. We have

generally valued intangible assets using discounted cash flow models. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to:

•
future expected revenues and costs related to software license sales, customer support agreements, customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names; and

•
discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.

In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset.

Net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations. Except for deferred revenues, net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company, if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date. For acquisitions completed prior to FY']:
NOTE 23: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental (including asbestos) and legal matters. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are generally based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the Company accrues the minimum amount. In addition, these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the following matters based on the information currently available, except as otherwise noted. However, the Company does not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Environmental Matters The Company's operations are subject to environmental regulation by various authorities. The Company has accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to, investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to individual sites, including the technology required to remediate, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding liability for environmental obligations are as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- --- - --- (In millions) 2022 2021 Environmental reserves included in Accrued liabilities $ 24 $ 29 Environmental reserves included in Other long-term liabilities 211 191 Tot...
