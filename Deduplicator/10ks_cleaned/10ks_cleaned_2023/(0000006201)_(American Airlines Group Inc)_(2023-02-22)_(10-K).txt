(2)Not meaningful or greater than 100% change.
Pre-Tax Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss)
Pre-tax income and net income were $186 million and $127 million, respectively, in 2022. This compares to 2021 pre-tax loss and net loss of $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.
The year-over-year improvement in our pre-tax income, on a GAAP basis, was driven by the continued strength in demand for air travel and a 21.3% increase in capacity as compared to 2021. This resulted in record passenger revenue for 2022 which was offset in part by higher aircraft fuel and related taxes, due to a 73.0% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel as well as increases in other operating expenses from increased capacity. The 2021 period also included the recognition of $4.4 billion of net pre-tax special credits, principally related to PSP Financial Assistance. See Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of pre-tax net special items.
Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $458 million in 2022 and pre-tax loss was $6.9 billion in 2021. The year-over-year improvement in our pre-tax income excluding pre-tax net special items was primarily due to record passenger revenue in 2022, offset in part by higher aircraft fuel and related taxes and increases in other operating expenses, as described above.

Revenue
In 2022, we reported total operating revenues of $49.0 billion, an increase of $19.1 billion, or 63.9%, as compared to 2021. Passenger revenue was $44.6 billion, an increase of $18.5 billion, or 71.0%, as compared to 2021. The increase in passenger revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a 33.5% increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), driven by the continued strength in demand for air travel domestically and in the Atlantic and Latin America regions, resulting in a 7.6 point increase in passenger load factor to 82.9% in 2022, and a 28.1% increase in passenger yield.
In 2022, cargo revenue was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $81 million, or 6.2%, as compared to 2021, primarily due to a 5.3% decrease in cargo ton miles driven by the discontinuation of our cargo-only flying and lower demand.
Other operating revenue increased $665 million, or 26.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher revenue associated with our loyalty program. During 2022 and 2021, cash payments from co-branded credit card and other partners were $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 18.82 cents in 2022, a 35.1% increase as compared to 13.93 cents in 2021, driven principally by the increase in passenger revenue as described above.
Fuel
In 2022, aircraft fuel expense totaled $13.8 billion, an increase of $7.0 billion as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a 73.0% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel including related taxes to $3.54 in 2022 from $2.04 in 2021 and a 17.4% increase in gallons of fuel consumed due to increased capacity.
As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.
Other Costs
We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: general economic conditions and the price of fuel.
Our 2022 CASM was 18.20 cents, an increase of 26.2%, from 14.42 cents in 2021. This increase in CASM was primarily driven by higher aircraft fuel and related taxes in 2022, as described above, and the recognition of $4.5 billion of operating net special credits in 2021 principally related to PSP Financial Assistance.
Our 2022 CASM excluding net special items and fuel was 12.83 cents, a decrease of 3.8%, from 13.33 cents in 2021.
For a reconciliation of total operating CASM to total operating CASM excluding net special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, we had $12.0 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $9.0 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, $2.8 billion in undrawn capacity under revolving credit facilities and a total of $220 million in undrawn short-term revolving and other facilities.
During 2022, we completed the following financing transactions (see Note 4 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information):
•repaid in full approximately $1.2 billion outstanding balance under, and terminated, the December 2016 Term Loan Facility;
•received $866 million in proceeds from enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs);
•repurchased $349 million of unsecured notes in the open market; and
•issued $205 million of equipment loans and other notes payable in connection with the financing of certain aircraft.

Table of Contents
A significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and/or contain covenants requiring us to meet certain loan to value, collateral coverage and/or peak debt service coverage ratios.
See Note 4 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.

Interest income increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of higher returns on our short-term investments. Interest expense, net increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of the AAdvantage Financing issued at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and higher interest expense on our variable-rate debt instruments as a result of increased interest rates, offset in part by debt repayments.
In 2022, other nonoperating income, net primarily included $424 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, offset in part by $74 million of net special charges principally for mark-to-market net unrealized losses associated with certain equity investments.
In 2021, other nonoperating income, net included $337 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, offset in part by $60 million of net special charges principally for mark-to-market net unrealized losses associated with certain equity investments and non-cash charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.
Income Taxes
In 2022, we recorded an income tax provision of $59 million with an effective rate of approximately 32%, which was substantially non-cash. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $16.2 billion of gross federal NOLs and $4.3 billion of other carryforwards available to reduce future federal taxable income, of which $5.9 billion will expire beginning in 2024 if unused and $14.6 billion can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had approximately $6.0 billion of NOL carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2022, which will expire in taxable years 2022 through 2042 if unused.
In 2021, we recorded an income tax benefit of $555 million at an effective rate of approximately 22%, which was substantially non-cash.

In 2022, American recorded an income tax provision of $116 million with an effective rate of approximately 26%, which was substantially non-cash. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2022, American had approximately $16.1 billion of gross federal NOLs and $3.5 billion of other carryforwards available to reduce future federal taxable income, of which $6.2 billion will expire beginning in 2024 if unused and $13.4 billion can be carried forward indefinitely. American also had approximately $5.9 billion of NOL carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2022, which will expire in taxable years 2022 through 2042 if unused.
In 2021, American recorded an income tax benefit of $500 million at an effective rate of approximately 22%, which was substantially non-cash.
See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.

In the ordinary course of our business, we or our affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, seek to prepay, retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, prepayments, retirements or exchanges, if any, will be conducted on such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. For further information regarding our debt repurchases for the year ended 2022, see Note 4 to AAG's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A.

Certain Covenants
Our debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, may restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase stock. Our debt agreements also contain customary change of control provisions, which may require us to repay or redeem such indebtedness upon certain events constituting a change of control under the relevant agreement, in certain cases at a premium. Certain of our debt financing agreements (including our secured notes, term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to value (LTV), collateral coverage or peak debt service coverage ratio covenants and certain agreements require us to appraise the related collateral annually or semiannually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the applicable LTV, collateral coverage or peak debt service coverage ratio exceeds or falls below a specified threshold, as the case may be, we will be required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash or investment securities), withhold additional cash in certain accounts, or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, or the interest rate for the relevant financing will be increased. As of the most recent applicable measurement dates, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing LTV, collateral coverage and peak debt service coverage tests. Additionally, a significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities, and our AAdvantage Financing contains a peak debt service coverage ratio, pursuant to which failure to comply with a certain threshold may result in early repayment, in whole or in part, of the AAdvantage Financing. For further information regarding our debt covenants, see Note 4 to AAG’s

Sources and Uses of Cash
For a comparison of the 2021 and 2020 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Sources and Uses of Cash” of our 2021 Form 10-K.
AAG
Operating Activities
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion and $704 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, a $1.5 billion year-over-year increase. In 2021, we received cash proceeds of approximately $4.7 billion associated with the PSP Financial Assistance. Excluding the PSP Financial Assistance, our operating cash flows increased $6.2 billion compared to 2021 primarily due to a return to profitability.
Investing Activities
Our net cash provided by investing activities was $636 million in 2022 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $6.0 billion in 2021.
Our principal investing activities in 2022 included $3.7 billion in net sales of short-term investments. These cash inflows were offset in part by $2.5 billion of capital expenditures, which primarily related to the purchase of 24 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 12 spare engines, and $321 million of equity investments, principally related to GOL. Additionally, we incurred $360 million related to airport construction projects, net of reimbursements, principally in connection with the renovation and expansion of Terminal 8 at JFK and the modernization of Terminals 4 and 5 at LAX.
Our principal investing activities in 2021 included $5.5 billion in net purchases of short-term investments as well as a $401 million increase in restricted short-term investments primarily related to collateral associated with the AAdvantage Financing and collateral held to support workers’ compensation obligations. We had capital expenditures of $208 million, net of aircraft purchase deposit returns of $996 million, which expenditures principally related to the harmonization of interior configurations across the mainline fleet and the purchase of two Airbus A321neo aircraft. Additionally, we incurred $204 million related to airport construction projects, net of reimbursements, principally in connection with the renovation and expansion of Terminal 8 at JFK and the modernization of Terminals 4 and 5 at LAX. These cash outflows were offset in part by $193 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment principally related to the disposition of retired aircraft and $181 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions.
Financing Activities
Our net cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion in 2022 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $5.3 billion in 2021.
Our principal financing activities in 2022 included $3.8 billion in repayments of debt and finance lease obligations, consisting of $2.2 billion of scheduled debt repayments including the repayment of $401 million in connection with the maturity of our 5.000% unsecured notes, the $1.2 billion prepayment of the December 2016 Term Loan Facility and the repurchase of $349 million of unsecured notes in the open market. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.1 billion of long-term debt proceeds, consisting of $866 million from the issuance of equipment notes related to the 2021-1 Aircraft EETCs and $205 million in connection with the financing of certain aircraft.
Our principal financing activities in 2021 included $12.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, including approximately $10.0 billion associated with the AAdvantage Financing, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount under the PSP2 Promissory Note, $946 million in aggregate principal amount under the PSP3 Promissory Note and the $150 million issuance of special facility revenue bonds related to JFK. We also received $460 million in net proceeds from the issuance of equity pursuant to an at-the-market offering. These cash inflows were offset in part by $7.3 billion in debt repayments, including prepayments totaling $2.8 billion for our revolving credit facilities, $950 million for the April 2016 Spare Parts Term Loan Facility and $550 million of outstanding loans under the Treasury Loan Agreement as well as $2.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments. In addition, we had $209 million of deferred financing cost cash outflows.

 AAG American
Debt Note 4 Note 3
Leases Note 5 Note 4
Employee Benefit Plans Note 9 Note 8
Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees Note 11 Note 10

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Pass-Through Trusts
American currently has 352 owned aircraft and 60 owned spare aircraft engines, which in each case were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment or to permit issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trusts allow American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.
Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft or engines. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines. The equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2022, $9.2 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Letters of Credit and Other
We provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, primarily to support airport commitments. As of December 31, 2022, we had $218 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations, of which $100 million is collateralized with our restricted cash. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2026.

Table of Contents
(e)See Part I, Item 2. Properties – “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments” for additional information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule, in particular the footnote to the table thereunder as to potential changes to such delivery schedule. Due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the table represent our most current estimate based on contractual delivery schedules adjusted for updates and revisions to such schedules communicated to management by the applicable equipment manufacturer. However, the actual delivery schedule may differ, potentially materially, based on various potential factors including production delays by the manufacturer and regulatory concerns. Additionally, the amounts in the table exclude four Boeing 787-8 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2023 and five Boeing 787-9 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2024, for which we have obtained committed lease financing. This financing is reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.
(f)Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and American’s actual payments could differ materially. Rental payments under operating leases for certain aircraft flown under these capacity purchase agreements are reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.
(g)Represents minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates as of December 31, 2022 and is based on estimated payments through 2032. In January 2023, we made $67 million of required pension contributions.
(h)Includes purchase commitments for aircraft fuel, flight equipment maintenance, information technology support and construction projects and excludes obligations under certain fuel offtake agreements or other agreements for which the timing of the related expenditure is uncertain, or which are subject to material contingencies, such as the construction of a production facility.

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions
In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements and new flight equipment, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising and liability management activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of, and transactions designed to manage the timing and amount of, secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity or equity-linked securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations (if any) and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover our cash obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks (such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.” for additional discussion. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance or similar liquidity requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 4 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.
In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt, lease and other obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

OTHER INFORMATION

Basis of Presentation
See Note 1 to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for information regarding the basis of presentation.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and 8B, respectively, for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.
Passenger Revenue
We recognize all revenues generated from transportation on American and our regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines.
The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. The estimate for tickets expected to expire unused is generally based on an analysis of our historical data. We have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate and recognize revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. This estimate is periodically evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate its accuracy. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. While the contract duration of passenger tickets is generally one year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the contract duration for certain tickets to September 30, 2022, principally those tickets which were issued in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, we extended the contract duration to December 31, 2022 for tickets to certain international destinations. Tickets issued in 2022 and thereafter are no longer subject to change fees which provides more flexibility for customers to change travel plans. Given this new flexibility offered to our customers, our estimate of revenue that will be recognized from the air traffic liability for future flown or unused tickets may be subject to variability and differ from historical experience.
Loyalty Revenue
We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as our co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, we apply the deferred revenue method.
Mileage credits earned through travel
For mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is adjusted for an estimate of mileage credits that will not be redeemed using a statistical model based on historical redemption patterns to develop an estimate of the likelihood of future redemption. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of mileage credits would have decreased revenues by approximately $105 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales to be recognized in future periods.

81

Table of Contents
Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners
We sell mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, including our co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with remaining terms generally from one to seven years as of December 31, 2022. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.
Our most significant mileage credit partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified two revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component and the marketing component.
The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.
The marketing component includes the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in these agreements, as well as advertising. We recognize the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage credit sale following the sales-based royalty method.
For the portion of our outstanding mileage credits that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Our estimates use a statistical model based on historical redemption patterns to develop an estimate of the likelihood of future redemption. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $100 million.
Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits
We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate and (2) expected return on plan assets (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- - ---- --- -
 2022 2021
Pension weighted average discount rate (1) 5.6 % 3.0 %
Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits weighted average discount rate (1) 5.7 % 2.8 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets (2) 8.0 % 8.0 %

(1)When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2022 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $725 million and $30 million, respectively, and decrease estimated 2023 pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $5 million and $1 million, respectively.
(2)The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% fixed income securities, 24% U.S. stocks, 22% private investments, 16% developed international stocks and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2022 would increase estimated 2023 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $60 million and $1 million, respectively.

82

Table of Contents
Annually, we review and revise certain economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates. The net effect of changing this assumption for the pension plans resulted in a decrease of $4.6 billion in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022. The net effect of changing this assumption for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in a decrease of $183 million in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2022.
See Note 9 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.
Income Taxes
Our ability to use our NOLs and other carryforwards depends on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand. We have determined that positive factors outweigh negative factors in the determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04: Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU 2022-06: Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848
ASU 2020-04 provides optional temporary guidance for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Topic 848 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022; however, because the intended cessation date of LIBOR was deferred to June 30, 2023, ASU 2022-06 was issued in December 2022 to extend the current relief in Topic 848 through December 31, 2024. We will adopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates and we do not expect the application of Topic 848 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

(7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill.

Additionally, a significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities, and our AAdvantage Financing contains a peak debt service coverage ratio, pursuant to which failure to comply with a certain threshold may result in early repayment, in whole or in part, of the AAdvantage Financing.
