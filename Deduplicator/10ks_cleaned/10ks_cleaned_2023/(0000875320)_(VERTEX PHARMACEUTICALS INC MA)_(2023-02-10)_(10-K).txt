ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 as compared to 2021 are discussed below. For a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 as compared to 2020, please refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below.
OVERVIEW
We are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have four approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, and we continue to focus on developing additional treatments for CF. Beyond CF, we have a pipeline that includes mid- and late-stage clinical programs in sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and earlier-stage programs in diseases such as muscular dystrophies.
Our triple combination regimen, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), was approved in 2019 in the United States (the “U.S.”) and in 2020 in the European Union (the “E.U.”). Collectively, our four medicines are being used by the majority of the approximately 88,000 people with CF in North America, Europe, and Australia. We are evaluating our medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene that is response to our CFTR modulators. We also are pursuing genetic therapies for people with CF who do not make CFTR protein and, as a result, cannot benefit from our current CF medicines.
Financial Highlights

-------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revenues In 2022, our net product revenues increased to $8.9 billion as compared to $7.6 billion in 2021, primarily due to the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and continued steady performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S., following the June 2021 launch of TRIKAFTA for children with CF 6 through 11 years of age.
Expenses Our total research and development (“R&D”), acquired in-process research and development (“AIPR&D”), and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased to $3.6 billion as compared to $3.9 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreased AIPR&D following a $900.0 million upfront payment we made in 2021 to CRISPR in connection with an amendment to our exa-cel collaboration, partially offset by increased spend to advance the progression of several product candidates into mid- to late-stage clinical development. Cost of sales was 12% of our net product revenues in 2022 and 2021.
Cash Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased to $10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to our net product revenues and operating cash flows, partially offset by income tax payments and our $315.0 million acquisition of ViaCyte.

Business Updates
Marketed Products
We expect to continue to grow our CF business by increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines, including younger people, and providing improved treatment options for people who are already eligible for one of our medicines. Recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below:
•The European Commission and the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) granted marketing authorization for KAFTRIO for the treatment of children with CF 6 through 11 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.
•The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved the use of ORKAMBI in children with CF 12 months to less than 24 months of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.
•In the fourth quarter of 2022, we submitted global regulatory filings for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age and for KALYDECO in children with CF from 1 month to less than 4 months of age.
•TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is now approved and reimbursed or accessible in more than 30 countries outside the U.S.
 Pipeline
We continue to advance a pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule and cell and genetic therapies aimed at treating serious diseases. Recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below.
Cystic Fibrosis
•We are conducting two Phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103, evaluating our new once-daily investigational triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, formerly known as VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, in people with CF 12 years of age and older, and have completed enrollment in these trials. We expect to complete these clinical trials by the end of 2023. We also have initiated a clinical trial of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age, known as the RIDGELINE study.
•In collaboration with Moderna, we are developing VX-522, an mRNA therapeutic for the treatment of people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. In December 2022, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for VX-522. We have initiated a single-ascending dose clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF, which is active and enrolling patients. We expect to complete this single ascending dose clinical trial and initiate the multiple ascending dose clinical trial in 2023. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for VX-522.
Sickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia
•We are evaluating the use of a non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, exagamglogene autotemcel (“exa-cel”), formerly known as CTX001, for the treatment of sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”).
•In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed regulatory submissions to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the MHRA for exa-cel for SCD and TDT, and both the EMA and the MHRA have validated the marketing authorization application. Exa-cel has been granted EMA Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) designation in the E.U. and Orphan Drug designation in the E.U. and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).
•In November 2022, we initiated the submission of a biologics licensing application (“BLA”) for exa-cel for SCD and TDT for rolling review by the FDA, and expect to complete the submission by the end of the first quarter of 2023. In the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Fast Track, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Rare Pediatric Disease, and Orphan Drug designations.
•Two additional Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating exa-cel in pediatric patients with SCD and TDT are ongoing.

65

Pain
•We have discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8, with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that provide effective non-opioid pain relief, without abuse potential. In March 2022, we announced positive Phase 2 data for VX-548, a NaV1.8 inhibitor, for treatment of acute pain. We have initiated two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials with a total of 2,000 patients with moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. The Phase 3 program for VX-548 also includes a single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of VX-548 in multiple other types of moderate to severe pain. We expect to complete these Phase 3 trials in late 2023 or early 2024.
•The FDA granted VX-548 Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.
•At the end of 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain.
APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease
•Inaxaplin, formerly known as VX-147, is our small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (“AMKD”), including APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (“FSGS”). Based on positive Phase 2 data in FSGS, we initiated pivotal development of inaxaplin in a single Phase 2/3 adaptive clinical trial in patients with AMKD. We continue to enroll patients in this Phase 2/3 clinical trial and we expect to complete the Phase 2 dose-ranging portion of the trial in 2023.
•The FDA granted inaxaplin Breakthrough Therapy designation for APOL1-mediated FSGS and the EMA granted inaxaplin Orphan Drug and PRIME designations for AMKD.
Type 1 Diabetes
•VX-880 is a stem cell-derived, allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. A clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate VX-880 as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes (“T1D”), and proof-of-concept has been achieved. We have completed enrollment in Part B of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and, after completion of Part B, we expect to begin Part C of the trial, with concurrent dosing, in 2023.
•We continue to advance additional programs in T1D, in which these same stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells are encapsulated and implanted in an immunoprotective device or are modified to produce hypoimmune cells with the goal of eliminating the need for immunosuppression. In December 2022, our Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) in Canada for VX-264, the cells and device program, was authorized and we plan to begin screening, enrollment and dosing in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND is on hold.
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
•We are working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (“AAT”) deficiency (“AATD”). We are developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with the goal of enabling the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AATD. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for VX-634, which is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties as compared to our previous AAT correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response.
•We initiated a second Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on the liver, as well as the levels of functional AAT in the plasma.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
•We are investigating a novel approach to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), which delivers CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to muscle cells, with the goal of restoring near-full length dystrophin protein expression by targeting specific mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease. We are conducting enabling studies for our first in vivo gene-editing therapy for DMD and we expect to submit an IND for this program in 2023.

66

Investment in External Innovation
Recent investments in external innovation are included below.
•We acquired from Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. (“Catalyst”) a portfolio of protease medicines that target the complement system and related intellectual property.
•We acquired ViaCyte, Inc. (“ViaCyte”), a biotechnology company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a potential functional cure for T1D. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program that we are developing in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (“CRISPR”), is active and enrolling patients.
•We established a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. (“Entrada”), focused on discovering and developing intracellular Endosomal Escape Vehicle (“EEV”) therapeutics for DM1 (the “Entrada Agreement”).
Our Business Environment
Our net product revenues come from the sale of our medicines for the treatment of CF. Our CF strategy involves continuing to develop and obtain approval and reimbursement for treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF and increasing the number of people with CF eligible and able to receive our medicines, including through label expansions, expanded reimbursement, and the development of new medicines. We are advancing our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of serious diseases outside of CF. Our strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of causal human biology and the science of therapeutics to discover and develop innovative medicines. This approach includes advancing multiple compounds from each program, spanning multiple modalities, into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising compounds for later-stage development, and to inform discovery and development of additional compounds. We aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates to provide durable clinical and commercial success.
In pursuit of new product candidates and therapies in specialty markets, we invest in research and development. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in product development and may provide product candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. To supplement our internal research programs, we acquire technologies and programs and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations, as needed, to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.
Discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or biological product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. Across the industry, most potential drug or biological products never progress into development, and most products that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. Our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our product development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. This process can result in rapid changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
Our business also requires ensuring appropriate manufacturing and reimbursement of our products. As we advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization and market and sell our approved products, we build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on a global network of third parties and our internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials. In addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations or to increase scale of production for existing products as needed. The processes for cell and genetic therapies can be more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require additional investments in different systems, equipment, facilities and expertise. We are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, as well as for our pipeline programs.
Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. Reimbursement for our products, including our potential pipeline therapies, cannot be assured and may take significant periods of time to obtain. We

67

dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.
In the U.S., we have worked successfully with third-party payors to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our CF medicines. We plan to continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that our medicines provide and provide patients with appropriate levels of access to our medicines now and in the future. We cannot, however, predict how recent changes in the law, including through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, will affect our ability to negotiate successfully with third-party payors in the future. In ex-U.S. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis, as required. This is necessary for each new medicine, as well as for label expansions for our current medicines. We expect to continue to focus significant resources to obtain expanded reimbursement for our CF medicines and, ultimately, pipeline therapies, in U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.
Strategic Transactions
Acquisitions
As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts.
In 2022, we acquired ViaCyte, a privately held biotechnology company with intellectual property, tools, technologies and assets with potential to accelerate development of our T1D programs, for $315.0 million; and acquired from Catalyst a portfolio of protease medicines that target the complement system and related intellectual property (the “Catalyst complement portfolio”) for $60.0 million. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and may include larger transactions or later-stage assets.
Our acquisition of ViaCyte was accounted for as a business combination. As of the acquisition date, the cash payment was allocated primarily to goodwill and the fair value of an in-process research and development asset. Operating expenses incurred by ViaCyte after the acquisition date and specific expenses associated with the acquisition are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations.
Our acquisition of the Catalyst complement portfolio was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all the fair value acquired was concentrated in in-process research and development assets, which did not constitute a business, and for which we determined there was no alternative future use. As a result, we recorded our $60.0 million upfront payment to AIPR&D.
Please refer to our critical accounting policies, “Acquisitions,” for further information regarding the significant judgments and estimates related to our acquisitions.
Collaboration and In-Licensing Arrangements
We enter into arrangements with third parties, including collaboration and licensing arrangements, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, product candidates, and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts.
Over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with a number of companies, including Arbor Biotechnologies, Inc., CRISPR, Kymera Therapeutics, Inc., Mammoth Biosciences, Inc., Moderna, Inc., Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc., and Verve Therapeutics, Inc. Generally, when we in-license a technology or product candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and/or agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. Most of these collaboration payments are expensed as AIPR however, depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the stage of development of the acquired technology, the significance of the in-licensed product candidate to the collaborator’s operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have engaged in previously.

68

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement (the “Entrada Agreement”) with Entrada focused on discovering and developing intracellular EEV therapeutics for DM1. In February 2023, the Entrada Agreement closed upon, among other things, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Upon closing, we made an upfront payment of approximately $224.0 million to Entrada, and purchased approximately $26.0 million of Entrada’s common stock in connection with the Entrada Agreement. We will account for the Entrada Agreement in the first quarter of 2023.
Joint Development and Commercialization Agreement with CRISPR
In 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (the “Original JDCA”) with CRISPR, pursuant to which we are developing and preparing to commercialize exa-cel for SCD and TDT. The Original JDCA was entered into following our exercise of an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in a collaboration agreement that we entered into with CRISPR in 2015.
In April 2021, we and CRISPR entered into an amendment and restatement of the Original JDCA (the “A&R JDCA”). In June 2021, we made a $900.0 million upfront payment to CRISPR in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the A&R JDCA. We concluded that we did not have any alternative future use for the acquired in-process research and development and recorded this upfront payment to AIPR&D. Under the terms of the A&R JDCA, we are leading worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of exa-cel. As of July 1, 2021, 60% of the net profits and net losses for exa-cel are allocated to us and 40% of the net profits and net losses for exa-cel are allocated to CRISPR, subject to certain adjustments. CRISPR may earn an additional one-time $200.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of exa-cel. We concluded that the Original JDCA and the A&R JDCA are cost-sharing arrangements, which result in the net impact of the arrangements, excluding amounts recorded to AIPR&D, being recorded in “Research and development expenses” in our consolidated statements of operations.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development
In 2022 and 2021, our AIPR&D included $115.5 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, related to upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including the collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions described above.
Out-License Agreements
We also have out-licensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. Pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development, and commercialization costs associated with these programs, and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. As a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and royalty revenues resulting from these programs. None of our out-license agreements had a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations during 2022 and 2021.
Please refer to Note B, “Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Arrangements,” for further information regarding our in-license agreements and out-license agreements.
Strategic Investments
In connection with our business development activities, we have periodically made equity investments in our collaborators. As of December 31, 2022, we held strategic equity investments in certain public and private companies, and we expect to make additional strategic equity investments in the future. While we invest the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in instruments that meet specific credit quality standards and limit our exposure to any one issue or type of instrument, our strategic investments are maintained and managed separately from our other cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As discussed below in “Other Income (Expense), Net” in our Results of Operations, any changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values (including publicly traded securities) are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Product Revenues, Net
In 2022, our net product revenues increased by $1.4 billion, or 18%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to the launches of TRIKAFTA/ KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and the continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S., following the June 2021 launch of TRIKAFTA for children with CF 6 through 11 years of age. Decreases in revenues for our products other than TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO were primarily the result of patients switching from these medicines to TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO.
Our net product revenues from the U.S. and from ex-U.S. markets were as follows:

--------------------- --------------------------------- ------- -------- --- ---- ------- -------- ------- ---- ------- - -------
 2022 % Change 2021 % Change 2020
 (in millions, except percentages)
United States $ 5,699.3 8% $ 5,287.3 10% $ 4,826.4

Product revenues, net $ 8,930.7 18% $ 7,573.4 22% $ 6,202.8

We expect that our net product revenues will increase in 2023 as a result of the continued performance of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, label expansions into younger age groups for our previously approved products, and expanded access to our medicines.

Beginning in 2022, we separately classify upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions as “Acquired in-process research and development expenses,” in our consolidated statements of operations in cases where such acquired assets do not have an alternative future use. To conform prior periods to our current presentation, we have reclassified $1.1 billion and $184.6 million from “Research and development expenses” to AIPR&D for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cost of Sales
Our cost of sales primarily consists of third-party royalties payable on net sales of our products as well as the cost of producing inventories. Pursuant to our agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, KALYDECO, and ORKAMBI, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens, with royalties on sales of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO lower than for our other products. Over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing due to increased net product revenues. Our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues was 12% in each of 2022 and 2021. In 2023, we expect our total cost of sales will increase due to expected increases in our net product revenues and our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues will be similar to our cost of sales as a percentage of net product revenues in 2022 and 2021.
Research and Development Expenses

--------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ------- -------- --- ---- ------- -------- ------- ---- ------- - -------
 2022 % Change 2021 % Change 2020
 (in millions, except percentages)
Research expenses $ 626.7 22% $ 512.3 13% $ 452.1
Development expenses 1,913.6 34% 1,425.5 20% 1,192.8
Total research and development expenses $ 2,540.3 31% $ 1,937.8 18% $ 1,644.9

Our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our products and product candidates. We do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual products or product candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. We assign external costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research by individual program. Our internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs. All research and development costs for our products and product candidates are expensed as incurred.

71

Over the past three years, we have incurred $7.5 billion in total research and development and AIPR&D expenses associated with product discovery and development. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. In addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the disease indication being targeted. The FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. Therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available.
Any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our product candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. Until we have data from Phase 3 clinical trials, we cannot make a meaningful estimate regarding when, or if, a clinical development program will generate revenues and cash flows.

Our research expenses have been increasing over the last several years as we have invested in our pipeline and expanded our cell and genetic therapy capabilities, resulting in increased headcount and infrastructure costs associated with our research facilities. We expect to continue to invest in our research programs with a focus on creating transformative medicines for serious diseases.
Development Expenses

Total development expenses $ 1,913.6 34% $ 1,425.5 20% $ 1,192.8

 Our development expenses increased by $488.1 million, or 34%, in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to increased costs to support clinical trials associated with our advancing pipeline programs, including our CF triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, pain and T1D. We are investing in both our internal headcount, leveraging outsourced services, and investing in infrastructure to support these programs. We expect our development expenses to continue to increase in 2023 as a result of our advancing pipeline programs, including our pain and T1D programs. In 2022 and 2021, costs related to our CF programs represented the largest portion of our development costs.

Acquired In-process Research and Development Expenses

----------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ----- -------- ----- -------- ------- ---- ---- - -----

 2022 % Change 2021 % Change 2020
 (in millions, except percentages)
Acquired in-process research and development expenses $ 115.5 (90)% $ 1,113.3 503% $ 184.6

 AIPR&D in 2022 was primarily related to a $60.0 million payment to acquire the Catalyst complement portfolio, a $25.0 million upfront payment pursuant to our license agreement with Verve, and various other payments. AIPR&D in 2021 included the $900.0 million upfront payment to CRISPR, a $60.0 million option payment to ApoLo1 Bio, LLC to buy-out all future milestone and royalty payments, and upfront payments of $31.0 million and $25.0 million to Mammoth Biosciences, Inc. and Arbor Biotechnologies, Inc., respectively. Our AIPR&D has historically fluctuated, and is expected to continue to fluctuate, from one period to another due to upfront, contingent milestone, and other payments pursuant to our existing and future business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

-------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ----- -------- ---- -------- ----- ---- -- - -----

 2022 % Change 2021 % Change 2020
 (in millions, except percentages)
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 944.7 12% $ 840.1 9% $ 770.5

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to the continued investment to support the commercialization of our medicines and increased support for our pipeline product candidates. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2023 as we progress our efforts in preparation for the commercialization of exa-cel.
Contingent Consideration
The fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $57.5 million in 2022, primarily as a result of a revision to the scope of certain gene-editing programs in the second quarter of 2022. The fair value of contingent consideration decreased by $3.1 million in 2021. In future periods, we expect the fair value of contingent consideration to increase or decrease based on, among other things, our estimates of the probability of achieving and the timing of these contingent development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as the time value of money and changes in market interest rates.
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net
Interest Income
Interest income increased to $144.6 million in 2022, as compared to $4.9 million in 2021, primarily due to increased market interest rates and increased cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. Our future interest income is dependent on the amount of, and prevailing market interest rates on, our outstanding cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $54.8 million in 2022 as compared to $61.5 million in 2021. The majority of our interest expense in these periods was related to imputed interest expense associated with our leased corporate headquarters in Boston.

73

Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was expense of $164.8 million in 2022 and income of $4.9 million in 2021. The vast majority of these amounts relate to net unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value and sales of certain of our strategic investments. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our investments in publicly traded companies was $116.8 million. To the extent that we continue to hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies, we will record other income (expense) related to these investments on a quarterly basis. We expect that due to the volatility of the stock price of biotechnology companies, our other income (expense), net will fluctuate in future periods based on increases or decreases in the fair value of our strategic investments.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, acquisitions and third-party collaboration and licensing transactions.
Our provision for income taxes was $910.4 million for 2022 and $388.3 million for 2021. Our effective tax rate of 21.5% for 2022 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to an increase in our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities associated with intercompany transfer pricing matters partially offset by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, tax credits, and changes in our estimated prior-year tax liabilities.
Our effective tax rate of 14.2% for 2021 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to discrete tax benefits of (i) $94.8 million associated with an increase in the U.K.’s corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%, which was enacted in June 2021 and will become effective in April 2023, and (ii) $44.1 million resulting from an R&D tax credit study that we completed in 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

------------------------------------------------ ------------- -------- ---- --------- -------- ------- --- ---
 2022 2021 % Change
 (in millions)
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 10,778.5 $ 7,524.9 43%
Working Capital:
Total current assets $ 13,234.8 $ 9,560.6 38%
Total current liabilities (2,742.1) (2,142.0) 28%
Total working capital $ 10,492.7 $ 7,418.6 41%

Working Capital
As of December 31, 2022, total working capital was $10.5 billion, which represented an increase of $3.1 billion from $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in total working capital in 2022 was primarily related to $4.1 billion of cash provided by operations driven by increased product revenues, partially offset by our $295.9 million net payment to acquire ViaCyte and purchases of property and equipment.

74

Cash Flows

------------------------------- ------------- ------- ---- - --------- ---- - -------
 2022 2021 2020
 (in millions)
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 4,129.9 $ 2,643.5 $ 3,253.5
Investing activities $ (321.1) $ (340.9) $ 99.4
Financing activities $ (67.7) $ (1,478.0) $ (505.3)

Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2022 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2021 primarily due to a $979.9 million increase in net income resulting from increased product revenues, the $900.0 million upfront payment to CRISPR paid in 2021, and an increase in product revenue accruals, partially offset by higher income tax payments.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $321.1 million and $340.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, our investing activities included a net payment of $295.9 million to acquire ViaCyte and $204.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net sales and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $227.3 million. Our investing activities in 2021 primarily related to purchases of property and equipment, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of notes receivable and strategic investments.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $67.7 million and $1.5 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the largest portion of our financing activities were payments related to our employee stock benefit plans and payments on finance leases. In 2021, the largest portion of our financing activities was $1.4 billion of share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase programs.
Sources and Uses of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $10.8 billion, which represented an increase of $3.3 billion from $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. We intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.
We expect that cash flows from our products together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. The adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by our products, and the potential introduction of one or more of our other product candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
Credit Facilities & Financing Strategy
 We may borrow up to a total of $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in July 2022 and could repay and reborrow amounts under this revolving credit agreement without penalty. Subject to certain conditions, we could request that the borrowing capacity be increased by an additional $500.0 million, for a total of $1.0 billion. Negative covenants in our credit agreement could prohibit or limit our ability to access this source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, the facility was undrawn, and we were in compliance with these covenants.
In July 2022, in conjunction with entering into our new credit agreement, we terminated the $500.0 million credit agreement we entered into in 2019. In September 2022, a $2.0 billion credit agreement we entered into in 2020 expired in accordance with its terms.
We may also raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities, or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. We will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen

75

our long-term liquidity profile. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
Future Capital Requirements
We have significant future capital requirements, including:
•Expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, manufacture and commercialize our existing and future products, and to operate our organization.
•Facility and finance lease obligations as described below.
•Royalties we pay to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation on sales of our CF products.
•Cash paid for income taxes.
In addition, we have significant potential future capital requirements including:
•We have entered into certain business development-related agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development, and commercialization efforts. Certain of our transactions, including collaborations, licensing arrangements, and asset acquisitions, include the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these research and development and commercialization efforts and to pay these potential milestone and royalties is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs associated with our collaborations, licensing arrangements and acquisitions. We may enter into additional business development transactions, including acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements and equity investments, that require additional capital.
•To the extent we borrow amounts under our existing credit agreement, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2027.
•In February 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time.
Additional information on several of our future capital requirements is provided below.
Research and Development Costs
At any point in time, we have several ongoing clinical trials at various stages of clinical development. Our clinical trial costs are dependent on, among other things, our research activities advancing to later-stage clinical development as well as the size, number, and length of our clinical trials.
Leases
Finance Leases
Our corporate headquarters is in two buildings that we lease at Fan Pier in Boston, Massachusetts. We commenced lease payments on these buildings in 2013 and the initial lease periods end in December 2028. We also lease office and laboratory space in San Diego, California. We commenced lease payments for this building in 2019 pursuant to an initial 16-year lease term. We account for each of these buildings as finance leases.
Operating Leases
We account for our remaining real estate leases as operating leases, including office and laboratory space at the Jeffrey Leiden Center for Cell and Genetic Therapies near our corporate headquarters. Base rent payments commenced in 2021 pursuant to an initial 15-year lease term for this building.

76

Our total future minimum lease payments for our finance and operating leases for each of the next five years and in total are included in Note M, “Leases.” The total future undiscounted minimum lease payments were $666.3 million and $491.3 million related to our finance and operating leases, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
We believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•revenue recognition;
•acquisitions, including intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration; and
•income taxes.
Our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in Note A, “Nature of Business and Accounting Policies.”
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenues, Net
We generate product revenues from sales in the U.S. and in international markets. We sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the U.S., which account for the largest portion of our total revenues. We make international sales primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies or pharmacy chains, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers. Our customers in the U.S. subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. We contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. We recognize net product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to our customers. Revenues from our product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price, which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price.
The most significant estimate we are required to make is related to government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. The values of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. To estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. We track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. We adjust our estimated rebates based upon new information as it becomes available, including information regarding actual rebates for our products. Claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. Our credits to revenue related to prior period sales have not been significant (typically less than 1% of gross product revenues) and primarily related to U.S. rebates.

77

The following table summarizes activity related to our accruals for rebates for 2022, 2021 and 2020:

------------------------------------------ ------------- -------
 (in millions)
Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 635.7
Provision related to 2020 sales 1,284.1
Adjustments related to prior year(s) sales 0.6
Credits/payments made (1,144.8)
Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 775.6
Provision related to 2021 sales 2,126.1
Adjustments related to prior year(s) sales (27.6)
Credits/payments made (2,035.5)
Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 838.6
Provision related to 2022 sales 2,977.2
Adjustments related to prior year(s) sales (10.4)
Credits/payments made (2,514.0)
Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 1,291.4

We have also entered into annual contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. Upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount, products are provided free of charge, which is a material right. We defer a portion of the consideration received, which includes upfront payments and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit as “Other current liabilities.” The deferred amount is recognized as revenue when the free products are shipped. To estimate the portion of the consideration received to be recognized as revenue and the portion of the amount to be deferred, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. Our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.
The preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. Changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
Acquisitions
As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. If we determine that substantially all the fair value that we acquire in an acquisition is concentrated in a single asset, and the acquisition does not constitute a business, we account for it as an asset acquisition. For an asset acquisition of intellectual property that has not yet achieved regulatory approval, we record our upfront payment to AIPR&D, as long as we determine there is no alternative future use for the asset that was acquired.
If the fair value that we acquired in an acquisition is distributed among more than one asset, and the acquisition constitutes a business, we account for it as a business combination.
We are required to make several significant judgments and estimates to calculate the purchase price for our business combinations and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on our consolidated balance sheet. The most significant judgments and estimates relate to the fair value of the in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities related to these business combinations. Based on these judgments and estimates, the fair value of the goodwill that we record as a result of these business combinations may be material. Once recorded, these assets are subject to quarterly impairment analysis and our contingent consideration liabilities are adjusted quarterly, which requires similar judgments and estimates.

78

Intangible Assets
In 2022, we recorded a $216.6 million in-process research and development intangible asset related to our acquisition of ViaCyte on our consolidated balance sheet. We also recorded a $13.0 million impairment of an in-process research and development intangible asset to “Research and development expenses,” due to a decision to revise the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs. As of December 31, 2022, we had $603.6 million of in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Each of these assets is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets until either the project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. Our in-process research and development intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
To determine the fair value of our in-process research and development assets, we have utilized either the multi-period excess earnings or the relief from royalty methods of the income approach. Each method requires us to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success, revenue projections and growth rates, and appropriate discount and tax rates. The multi-period excess earnings method also requires us to estimate development and commercial costs. The relief from royalty method also requires us to estimate the after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the asset that we acquired.
Contingent Consideration
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $129.0 million and $186.5 million, respectively, of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to the fair value of the contingent development and regulatory payments that we may owe to Exonics’ former equity holders upon the achievement of certain events. The decrease in fair value of contingent consideration during 2022 was primarily due to a revision to the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs.
We record an increase or a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of operations on a quarterly basis. We determine the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievement and the corresponding estimated probability of technical and regulatory success rates. Significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. Reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. Due to the early stage of Exonics’ programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had goodwill of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. In 2022, we recorded $85.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet related to our acquisition of ViaCyte. In 2021, we did not have any business combinations; therefore, we did not record any additional goodwill. Goodwill reflects the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Thus, the goodwill that we record is dependent on the significant judgments and estimates inherent in the fair value of our in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities. We have one reporting unit for goodwill reporting purposes. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We have not identified any goodwill impairment to date.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. If our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. On a

79

periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance of $237.8 million related primarily to U.S. state tax attributes.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adjust our liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions. We are subject to tax laws and audits in multiple jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in making this assessment. Consequently, we regularly re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. As of December 31, 2022, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $459.6 million.
