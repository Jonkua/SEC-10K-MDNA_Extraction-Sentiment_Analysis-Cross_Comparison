Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in the table that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees, particularly in 2020 and 2021. Significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developed in 2022 and are continuing in 2023. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.

Insurance underwriting generated an after-tax loss of $90 million in 2022 and after-tax earnings of $728 million in 2021 and $657 million in 2020. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021 and $750 million in 2020. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities at GEICO, and favorably impacted by higher earnings from reinsurance underwriting and foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities and by the reduction in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, as well as from high claims costs in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, significantly reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance coverages.

After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by low interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Results of Operations (Continued)

After-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF were relatively unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 16.1% in 2021 versus 2020. Results in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected relatively low railroad operating revenues from reduced shipping volumes, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements.

After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 13.7% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax equity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business. The increase in 2021 reflected higher earnings from the U.S. utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses.

Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 12.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 34.0% in 2021 versus 2020. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses. We experienced the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs through much of 2022. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to relatively strong customer demand for products and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains.

Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Other earnings also included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016.

Insurance—Underwriting

Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.

The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri.

Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)

We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. These businesses were included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results beginning as of that date.

We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less losses incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges.

Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

----------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ----- ---- - ------ -
 2022 2021 2020
Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss):

GEICO

GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

------------------------------------ ------ ------ - ---- ----- ------ - ------ ------ ------ ----- - ------ - ------ -----
 2022 2021 2020
 Amount % Amount % Amount %
Premiums written $ 39,107 $ 38,395 $ 34,928
Premiums earned $ 38,984 100.0 $ 37,706 100.0 $ 35,093 100.0
Losses and loss adjustment expenses 36,297 93.1 30,999 82.2 26,018 74.1
Underwriting expenses 4,567 11.7 5,448 14.5 5,647 16.1
Total losses and expenses 40,864 104.8 36,447 96.7 31,665 90.2
Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ (1,880 ) $ 1,259 $ 3,428

GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting results in each of the past three years were significantly affected by changes in average claims frequencies and severities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided a 15% premium reduction to all new or renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected significant increases in average claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continued to trend higher in 2022.

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)

GEICO (Continued)

2022 versus 2021

Premiums written increased $712 million (1.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, which were substantially offset by a decrease in policies-in-force. Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 8.9% in 2022 compared to 2021 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased 11.3%. Premiums earned increased $1.3 billion (3.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, partially attributable to a reduction in 2021 of approximately $475 million from the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.3 billion (17.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 93.1% in 2022, an increase of 10.9 percentage points over 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ events.

Claims frequencies in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and collision (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision (fourteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $653 million in 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $400 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $375 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021.

Underwriting expenses decreased $881 million (16.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs and lower employee-related costs. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 11.7% in 2022, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points compared to 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums.

GEICO has successfully obtained premium rate increase approvals from certain states in response to the significant claims costs increases it has experienced in recent years. As a result, we currently expect GEICO to generate an underwriting profit in 2023.

2021 versus 2020

Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s loss ratio increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years.

Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 were $81 million from significant catastrophe events.

Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower expenses and higher premiums earned.

BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). This group also includes Alleghany’s RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“Alleghany Insurance”) beginning October 19, 2022. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Total losses and expenses 13,353 97.1 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8
Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 393 $ 607 $ 110

Premiums written increased $2.0 billion (16.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases at BH Specialty (16%), USLI (16%), BHHC (15%) and MedPro Group (10%), and from the inclusion of Alleghany Insurance ($435 million). Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases from BH Specialty (36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%) and USLI (20%). The increases in each year were across a variety of coverages and in several markets.

BH Primary’s loss ratio increased 1.9 percentage points compared to 2021, which decreased 4.1 percentage points versus 2020. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events were $641 million in 2022 ($554 from Hurricane Ian), $433 million in 2021 ($239 million from Hurricane Ida) and $207 million in 2020 ($160 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Incurred losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities attributable to the pandemic of $167 million. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $428 million in 2022, $631 million in 2021 and $265 million in 2020. BH Primary insurers continue to write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Claims liabilities could be greater than anticipated due to a variety of factors.

Underwriting expenses increased $603 million (21.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, while underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases reflected the increases in premiums earned and changes in business mix.

Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 2,180 $ 667 $ (799 )

Premiums written increased $2.8 billion (19.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to net increases in new property business and higher rates, and the inclusion of the TransRe Group ($986 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $727 million (7.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were $2.0 billion in 2022 ($1.6 billion from Hurricane Ian), $2.1 billion ($933 million from Hurricane Ida) in 2021 and $667 million in 2020 ($357 million in the aggregate from Hurricanes Laura and Sally). Losses incurred in 2020 also included $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events of $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021 and increases of $162 million in 2020.

Underwriting expenses as percentages of premiums earned decreased 2.9 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects and changes in business mix. Underwriting expenses included foreign currency exchange gains of $371 million in 2022 compared to $173 million in 2021, related to the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects.

Life/health

A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

------------------------------------ ------ ----- ---- ----- ------ - ----- ----- ------ ----- - ----- - ----- -----
 2022 2021 2020
 Amount % Amount % Amount %
Premiums written $ 5,185 $ 5,621 $ 5,848

Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) $ 292 $ (421 ) $ (18 )

Life/health premiums written decreased $436 million (7.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021 which decreased 3.9% from 2020. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects ($289 million) and decreased volume in the Asia Pacific region. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits declined $929 million (18.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in assumptions used in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business in run-off.

Retroactive reinsurance

Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency gains were $168 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2021 versus pre-tax losses of $171 million in 2020.

Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $836 million in 2022, $840 million in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily from deferred charge amortization. Underwriting results also reflected the effects of changes in the estimates of the timing of future payments and amounts of ultimate claim liabilities. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts were increased $86 million in 2022 and reduced $974 million in 2021, which net of related changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced relatively insignificant effects on underwriting earnings.

Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.4 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $2.4 billion since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $769 million since December 31, 2021. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.

Periodic payment annuity

Periodic payment annuity premiums earned decreased $76 million (11.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, which increased $92 million (16.3%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)

Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $164 million in 2022 and $18 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $67 million in 2020.

Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $696 million in 2022, $526 million in 2021 and $550 million in 2020. Pre-tax losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to the termination of a reinsurance contract, in which the settlement paid exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted liabilities were $15.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be reflected in other comprehensive income.

Variable annuity

Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $117 million in 2022 and $114 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets.

Dividend income increased $979 million (19.3%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased $170 million (3.5%) in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income included $46 million in 2022, $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment.

Interest and other investment income increased $1.1 billion (186.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in interest income due to interest rate increases during the year, as well as the inclusion of interest income on assets of Alleghany’s insurance subsidiaries. Interest and other investment income in 2021 declined 44.4% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Insurance—Investment Income (Continued)

Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $164 billion at December 31, 2022, $147 billion at December 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Float at December 31, 2022 included approximately $14 billion attributable to Alleghany’s insurance and reinsurance businesses. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $98 million in 2022, and the cost of float was nominal. In 2021 and 2020, our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains, and consequently, the cost of float in each year was negative.

2022 versus 2021

Railroad operating revenues increased 11.9% in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting an 18.9% increase in average revenue per car/unit, including the impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes of 5.8%. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.9% in 2022 from 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 were impacted by lower volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, offset by higher yield and fuel surcharge revenue.

Operating revenues from consumer products increased 11.8% in 2022 to $9.2 billion compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 8.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments, resulting from supply chain disruptions and lower west coast imports during the second half of the year.

Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 5.6% from 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 5.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in petroleum products related to lower demand for shipments of crude by rail and lower building products, steel and taconite shipments, partially offset by increased mineral shipments.

Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 12.6% to $5.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit partially offset by lower volumes of 2.0%. The decrease in volumes was primarily due to lower grain exports and fertilizer shipments, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks.

Operating revenues from coal increased 21.7% to $3.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Coal volumes were unchanged compared to 2021.

Railroad (Continued)

Railroad operating expenses were $16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion (21.2%) compared to 2021. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 65.9% in 2022 versus 2021. The operating expense increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $557 million (11.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from the ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $1.8 billion (65.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $384 million (21.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty and litigation costs.

Approximately 31,000 of BNSF’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in multi-party national negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board and subsequent appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. Thereafter, a majority of the unions ratified those agreements with the remainder being imposed by Congress in December 2022. This concluded the national round which is not subject to re-opening until late 2024.

2021 versus 2020

Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by disruptions in the global supply chain.

Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.

Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.

Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs.

Utilities and Energy

We currently own 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S”). Other energy businesses include two regulated electricity distribution businesses operated by BHE subsidiaries (referred to as Northern Powergrid) in Great Britain, a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of real estate brokerage franchises in the United States.

The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

2022 versus 2021

Our U.S. utilities operate in several states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). After-tax earnings increased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and a $157 million increase in production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses and state income taxes. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC and NV Energy, increases in general and plant maintenance costs, incremental depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and higher accruals at PacifiCorp associated with the 2020 wildfires.

The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $586 million (8.3%) compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at PacifiCorp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather.

Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $233 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Substantially all of the increase was derived from BHE GT&S, primarily attributable to higher regulated storage and service revenues from a general rate case settlement and higher revenues and margins from non-regulated activities, as well as income tax adjustments.

Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $359 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $200 million and the impact in 2021 on income tax expense of $109 million at Northern Powergrid related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The earnings increase also reflected higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and earnings from new gas exploration and solar projects, partially offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms as well as increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.

Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $287 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to an 11% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 40% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to lower homeowner refinancing activity resulting from rising interest rates.

Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower state income tax benefits and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2022.

Utilities and Energy (Continued)

2021 versus 2020

The U.S. utilities’ after-tax earnings increased $242 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and an increase of $139 million in production tax credits recognized at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC, increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and by the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021 at PacifiCorp. The operating expense increase was partially offset by the impact of accruals at PacifiCorp in 2020 associated with wildfires and changes to a settlement agreement in 2021 related to a hydroelectric facility, as well as lower costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at NV Energy.

The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $126 million (1.8%) compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes and favorable wholesale pricing, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs as well as lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020 at NV Energy. Retail customer volumes increased 3.8% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather.

Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $279 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The earnings increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental earnings of $211 million from the BHE GT&S acquisition completed in November 2020. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year.

Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $26 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid ($46 million), partially offset by lower earnings from renewable energy. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $74 million from increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rates in both 2021 and 2020. The decline in earnings from renewable energy reflected a reduction in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.

Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity.

Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020.

Industrial products

The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition Additionally, the Alleghany businesses included certain other smaller manufacturers that primarily became part of Marmon.

2022 versus 2021

Revenues of the industrial products group in 2022 increased $2.6 billion (9.4%) and pre-tax earnings increased $393 million (8.8%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2022 was 15.8%, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared 2021.

PCC’s revenues were $7.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion (16.5%) compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, Boeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products.

PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC’s results in 2022 were negatively affected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income. PCC management has taken and will continue to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for its products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by effects of supply constraints for certain raw materials and the effects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. We believe supply chain and required maintenance constraints are easing and that we can increase production rates and sales volumes in 2023.

Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 48.6% compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 included insurance recoveries of $242 million related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and a fire in 2021 at the Rockton, Illinois, facility compared to insurance recoveries of $55 million in 2021. Earnings in 2022 also included aggregate losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire of $36 million compared to aggregate losses and asset impairment charges in 2021 of $257 million related to the Rockton facility fire and an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, which caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced lost sales and incremental manufacturing and other operating costs.

Marmon’s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These increases generally reflected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store shelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and infrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, utility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank car sales.

K-48

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)

Industrial products (Continued)

Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 11.3% compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Crane and several other business groups due to higher volumes and pricing, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates, higher repair costs and losses of approximately $90 million related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia.

IMC’s revenues increased 4.5% to $3.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased sales in most regions, partially offset by the foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, lower sales in China (attributable to the pandemic) and the effects the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Europe. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 2.5% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower average gross sales margins, primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix and higher raw material costs. Earnings were also negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and the Russian-Ukraine conflict.

2021 versus 2020

Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2020.

PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and OEM aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. PCC’s revenues were negatively impacted in both years by reduced aircraft production levels, which reflected order delays and cancellations by airlines and inventory reduction initiatives within the industry.

PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020, which reflected significant restructuring costs and inefficiencies associated with reduction in production. Asset impairment and restructuring costs in 2020 were $295 million. The 2021 earnings increase also reflected the actions taken by management in 2020 and 2021 to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines in 2021 were negatively affected by the impacts of the severe winter weather events in the first quarter, raw materials supply constraints and unplanned maintenance in the second half of the year.

Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. The earnings decline in 2021 included previously mentioned losses of $257 million related to the Rockton, Illinois facility fire and asset impairment charges, as well as the adverse effects of rising raw material costs and the winter storms in 2021.

Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020, which was negatively impacted by the initial effects of the pandemic. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix.

K-49

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)

Industrial products (Continued)

Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 40.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins and relatively low earnings in 2020 attributable to the pandemic. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups.

IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects.

Building products

The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).

2022 versus 2021

Revenues of the building products group increased $3.9 billion (15.7%) in 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $1.4 billion (41.3%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.6% in 2022 and 13.6% in 2021. During 2021 and much of 2022, our businesses experienced relatively strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for new home construction in the fourth quarter. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels.

Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $12.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.2 billion (21.1%) over 2021. Revenues from home sales for the year increased $2.1 billion (25.1%) in 2022 to approximately $10.4 billion, primarily due to higher average selling prices. New home unit sales increased 6.2% in 2022, reflecting a 6.0% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 7.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. However, unit sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 3.9% from 2021, and our net order backlog declined significantly during 2022. We expect the comparative decline in unit sales to accelerate in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2021. Actual and anticipated loan foreclosures rose during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $685 million (40.7%) compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income. As previously mentioned, we expect unit home sales to decline in the near term and we anticipate earnings will also decline in 2023 compared to 2022.

Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $16.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 11.8% versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Significant cost inflation in 2021, that continued through 2022, largely drove the higher selling prices.

Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 41.9% over 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in 2022, a 3.2 percentage point increase compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as an increase in gains from certain business divestitures and asset sales and reduced impairment and restructuring charges. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs in 2021.

2021 versus 2020

Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions that contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints.

Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020.

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products.

Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected operating results. In addition, higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.

Consumer products

The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (“Jazwares”), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition.

2022 versus 2021

Consumer products group revenues increased $481 million (3.1%) in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting an 8.0% increase from Forest River and the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, substantially offset by lower apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues (4.7% in the aggregate). In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products revenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by significant declines in recreational vehicle unit sales. Revenues of Forest River increased 8.0% in 2022 compared to 2021, while apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues decreased 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The declines in apparel and footwear revenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)

Consumer products (Continued)

Consumer products group pre-tax earnings declined $456 million (23.0%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and as a percentage of revenues in 2022 decreased 3.2 percentage points to 9.5%. The earnings decline reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River (7.6%).

Our apparel businesses were negatively affected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions in sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 have also elevated our current inventories. We currently believe retailers will continue to constrain purchases in the near term and that our sales volumes and earnings will continue to be negatively affected. We are taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and reduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects.

Earnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. However, sales volumes, revenues and earnings declined over the second half of the year compared to the elevated levels in the first half of 2022 and in 2021. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River’s comparative revenues and earnings to decline in 2023, particularly over the first half of the year.

2021 versus 2020

Consumer products group revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs.

Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%.

Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year.

Service

Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management.

2022 versus 2021

Service group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to revenue increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. Revenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter, new orders began to slow in certain regions and markets and the slowing of new orders was observed across nearly all regions in the fourth quarter. The slowing of electronic components demand is in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (11%), customer flight hours (9%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by changes in sales mix.

Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as well as increased earnings from several of our smaller services businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and lower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings at our smaller services companies increased $106 million (19.3%) over 2021, reflecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage.

2021 versus 2020

Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).

Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage, changes in sales mix and a gain from a legal settlement. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand.

Retailing

Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), which represented 65% of our combined retailing revenue in 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in 2022.

Retailing (Continued)

Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany.

2022 versus 2021

Retailing group revenues in 2022 increased $337 million (1.8%) compared to 2021, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues in 2022 increased 6.1% compared to 2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle unit sales continue to be constrained by relatively low new vehicle production, although production gradually trended higher during 2022. Revenues from BHA’s service and repair business increased 11.1% versus 2021. Revenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%, primarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef.

Pre-tax earnings in 2022 of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) from 2021 and the pre-tax margin rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates began to accelerate during the second half of 2021, attributable to low available inventory. BHA’s vehicle gross margin rates peaked in the first half of 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased $233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced earnings from the home furnishings group, See’s Candies and Pampered Chef.

2021 versus 2020

Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0%, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales increased $1.7 billion (20.7%), primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at manufacturers attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0%, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs.

Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) in 2021 from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5%, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts.

Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020.

McLane

McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2022 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings.

2022 versus 2021

Revenues of $53.2 billion in 2022 increased $3.8 billion (7.6%) compared to 2021. Revenues from the grocery business increased 4.4%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 14.1% and 6.0%, respectively.

Pre-tax earnings increased $41 million (17.8%) in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected slightly higher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, fuel expense and insurance costs. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, high fuel costs and high inventory costs.

2021 versus 2020

Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.

Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we experienced, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel costs was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices.

Investment and Derivative Contract Gains (Losses) (Continued)

Investment gains (losses)

Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries. Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized losses of approximately $63.1 billion in 2022 and gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021 and $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including losses of $3.9 billion in 2022, gains of $1.0 billion in 2021 and losses of $14.0 billion in 2020. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $769 million in 2022, $3.6 billion in 2021 and $6.2 billion in 2020.

We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value.

Derivative contract gains (losses)

Derivative contract gains and losses include the changes in fair value of our few remaining equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings. Substantially all of our contracts have expired and our exposure to loss in the future is insignificant.

After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Occidental Petroleum and Berkadia. Equity method earnings increased $724 million in 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and Pilot and from the inclusion of Occidental Petroleum, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $550 million in 2022, $317 million in 2021 and $170 million in 2020, which included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $611 million in 2020. Our after-tax earnings from Occidental in 2022 were $258 million and our after-tax earnings from Pilot increased $267 million in 2022 compared to 2021. As a result of the increase in our ownership in Pilot to 80% on January 31, 2023, we discontinued the use of the equity method on that date. See Note 26 to the Consolidated financial Statements.

After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details.

Other (Continued)

Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to the Berkshire and BHFC Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In 2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains on these debt issues, due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and other unallocated income and income taxes.

Financial Condition

Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 was $472.4 billion, a decrease of $33.8 billion since December 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $22.8 billion and included after-tax losses on our investments of approximately $53.4 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced significant volatility in our earnings.

Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $7.9 billion during 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and Class B common stock.

At December 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0 billion, which included $94.7 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $333.9 billion. During 2022, we paid cash of $67.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $33.7 billion from sales of equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion, which held cash and investments of $19.7 billion as of the acquisition date. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion, which was based on Pilot’s unaudited earnings in 2022 and its net debt as of December 31, 2022 and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of the audit of Pilot’s 2022 consolidated financial statements.

Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $122.7 billion, of which approximately 94% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. During 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $12.7 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.9 billion of maturing senior debt. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $17.4 in 2023; $10.4 in 2024; $11.0 in 2025; $8.7 in 2026; and $8.1 in 2027.

Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $21.4 billion, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In 2022, Berkshire issued an aggregate ¥243.5 billion (approximately $1.94 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.8%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $1.4 billion during 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt.

Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $25.1 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion since December 31, 2021. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2021, reflecting the issuance of debt, repayments of maturing debt ($775 million) and reductions in the carrying value of non-U.S. denominated debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes ($300 million). In 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes maturing in 2027, 2032 and 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Subsidiary borrowings as of December 31, 2022 included approximately $2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany and its subsidiaries.

BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $233 million from December 31, 2021. In 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053 and repaid approximately $900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.8 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2021. In 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053. During 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $3.0 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2053. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.

In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows between $37 billion and $40 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $15.5 billion in 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $11.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $13.7 billion in 2023.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations

We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.8 in 2023; $1.6 in 2024; $1.4 in 2025; $1.3 in 2026; and $1.5 in 2027.

We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $143 billion at December 31, 2022. We currently forecast claim payments in 2023 of approximately $35 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2023. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $2 billion in 2023 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.

Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $24 billion, including $12 billion in 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2022 follows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions.

As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.

Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $143 billion, of which 78% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.

GEICO

GEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2022, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $24.8 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.

Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2022, case development liabilities averaged approximately 38% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.

IBNR claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.

Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2021 were reduced by $653 million during 2022, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2022 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.

With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2022. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $245 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group

BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2022 follows (in millions).

------------------------------------------------ -------- ------ -------- - ------ ----- - ------
 Property Casualty Total
Reported case liabilities $ 8,314 $ 12,136 $ 20,450
IBNR liabilities 9,084 21,041 30,125
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 17,398 33,177 50,575
Reinsurance recoverable 787 1,439 2,226
Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 16,611 $ 31,738 $ 48,349

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.

In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.

The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates.

Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons.

As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2022, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $650 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)

Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:

Paid and incurred loss development methods – These methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.

Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – These methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.

Frequency and severity methods – These methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.

Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.

Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.

For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.

In 2022, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $114 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.

For other casualty losses, other than asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $650 million in 2022. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $980 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $980 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.

The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2022. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)

Retroactive reinsurance

Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion and deferred charges were $9.9 billion.

Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $52 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability.

We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed.

Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.

We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $86 million in 2022. In 2022, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.4 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.

In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that amortization expense in 2023 will approximate $860 million.

Other Critical Accounting Policies

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $78.1 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)

As of December 31, 2022, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations.

We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.

In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion.

In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments.

Market Risk Disclosures

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.

Equity Price Risk

Equity securities represent the most significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five companies.

We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Equity Price Risk (Continued)

For the past several years, we were also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. However, substantially all of the contracts written to date have expired.

The following table summarizes our significant assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes.

Interest Rate Risk

We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.

Interest Rate Risk (Continued)

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk

Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way.

Foreign Currency Risk (Continued)

Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and its U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ------ -

Net liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts included in net earnings 263 58
Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income (2,045 ) (1,021 )

Commodity Price Risk

Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We generally do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...
