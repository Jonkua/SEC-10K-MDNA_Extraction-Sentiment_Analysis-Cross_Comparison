We assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. A discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “Financial Condition and Liquidity.”

Overview
We are a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals that are designed to meet our customers’ needs across a diverse range of end markets. Our corporate purpose is making the world safe and sustainable by powering the potential of people. The end markets we serve include energy storage, petroleum refining, consumer electronics, construction, automotive, lubricants, pharmaceuticals and crop protection. We believe that our commercial and geographic diversity, technical expertise, access to high-quality resources, innovative capability, flexible, low-cost global manufacturing base, experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate.
Secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainable revenue. For example, our Lithium business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric vehicles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage; Bromine enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment, greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants; and the Catalysts business creates efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil, enables safer, greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels, and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements, among other factors, position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur, while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment.

2022 Highlights
•In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend for the 29th consecutive year, to $0.395 per share.
•In January 2022, we signed a joint development agreement with 6K to explore the use of 6K’s patented UniMelt® advanced, sustainable materials production platform to develop novel lithium battery materials through potentially disruptive manufacturing processes.
•In February 2022, we announced that we signed a non-binding letter agreement with our MARBL joint venture partner, MRL, to explore a potential expansion of the MARBL joint venture, in an effort to expand lithium conversion capacity with increased optionality and reduced risk.
•In May 2022, we issued $1.7 billion of senior notes pursuant to an underwritten public offering. The proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem the 4.15% Senior Notes due in 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), repay the balance of commercial paper outstanding and for general corporate purposes.
•Production of spodumene concentrate from the first and second trains at the Wodgina mine managed by our 60%-owned MARBL joint venture was achieved in May and July of this year, respectively.
•We announced plans to build integrated lithium operations in the United States, including the Kings Mountain, North Carolina spodumene mine and a lithium conversion plant in the Southeast.
•We announced the conclusion of our strategic review of the Catalysts business. As a result of the review, we chose to retain the business under a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle that has been renamed Ketjen in 2023. This structure is intended to allow the Catalysts business to respond to unique customer needs and global market dynamics more effectively while also achieving its growth ambitions.
•We announced the realignment of our Lithium and Bromine global business units into a new corporate structure designed to better meet customer needs and foster talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment. The realignment was effective January 1, 2023, and resulted in the following three reportable segments: (1) Energy Storage; (2) Specialties; and (3) Ketjen (Catalysts).
•In October 2022, we announced that we have been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electric grid and for materials and components

currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina, location.
•In October 2022, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Qinzhou, for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tonnes of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.
•In December 2022, we unveiled a groundbreaking product, MercLok™, which captures mercury from soil and mining waste, helping to remove this harmful element from the food chain.
•In December 2022, we announced the acquisition of a location in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we intend to invest at least $180 million to establish the Albemarle Technology Park, a world-class facility designed for novel materials research, advanced process development, and acceleration of next-generation lithium products to market. We anticipate that innovations from the new site will enhance lithium recovery, improve production methods, and introduce new forms of lithium to enable breakthrough levels of battery performance. In addition, we anticipate the creation of at least 200 jobs at the site.
•We achieved net income of $2.7 billion during 2022 compared to $123.7 million for 2021. The increase in 2022 net income was primarily driven by increased lithium prices reflecting tight market conditions and greater volumes sold under index-referenced and variable-based contracts.
•Cash flows from operations in 2022 were $1.9 billion compared to $344.3 million in 2021.

Outlook
The current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, the market for lithium battery and energy storage, particularly for electric vehicles (“EVs”), remains strong, providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. Amidst these dynamics, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the chief operating decision maker began evaluating performance, forecasting and making resource allocation decisions based on our previously announced realignment of the Lithium and Bromine global business units. The new corporate structure was designed to better meet customer needs and foster talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment. The realignment resulted in the following three reportable segments: (1) Energy Storage; (2) Specialties; and (3) Ketjen (Catalysts). The below segment outlook is presented in the new segment structure based on how the chief operating decision maker started reviewing the business starting in 2023.
Energy Storage: We expect Energy Storage results to increase year-over-year in 2023, mainly due to increased pricing as well as higher sales volume. The increased market pricing reflects tight market conditions, primarily in battery- and tech-grade carbonate and hydroxide, as well as renegotiations of certain of our long-term agreements. Since the beginning of 2022 market indices have increased 70% to 200%. Some of our renegotiated contracts include higher prices on existing long-term agreements that are more reflective of current market conditions. In other cases, we have moved from previous fixed-price, long-term agreements towards index-referenced and variable-priced contracts. As a result, our Energy Storage business is more aligned with changes in market and index pricing than it has been in the past. While we expect these prices to remain strong throughout the year, a material decline in these market prices would have a negative impact on our outlook. The increased sales volume is primarily expected from new capacity coming on line from La Negra, Chile, Kemerton, Western Australia, and the recently completed acquisition of Qinzhou, which includes a lithium hydroxide conversion plant designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of LCE per year. While we ramp up our new capacity, we will continue to utilize tolling arrangements to meet growing customer demand. EV sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year as the lithium battery market remains strong.

54

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

We announced agreements for a strategic investment in China with plans to build a battery grade lithium conversion plant in Meishan initially targeting 50,000 metric tons of LCE per year. Construction of the Meishan facility is currently underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2024. In addition, production of spodumene concentrate from the first and second trains at the Wodgina mine managed by our 60%-owned MARBL joint venture was achieved in May and July of this year, respectively. In February 2022, we announced that we signed a non-binding letter agreement with our MARBL joint venture partner, MRL, to explore a potential expansion of the MARBL joint venture, in an effort to expand lithium conversion capacity with increased optionality and reduced risk.
On a longer-term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases. This demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium-ion battery costs, increasing battery performance, continuing significant investments in the battery and EV supply chain by cathode and battery producers and automotive OEMs and favorable global public policy toward e-mobility/renewable energy usage. Our outlook is also bolstered by long-term supply agreements with key strategic customers, reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner, highlighted by our scale, access to geographically diverse, low-cost resources and long-term track record of reliability of supply and operating execution.
Specialties: We expect both net sales and profitability to increase in 2023 due to strength in demand across our product portfolio that benefits from diverse end markets. One anticipated contributor to growth is the December 2022 launch of MercLok, a groundbreaking new bromine-based product that sequesters elemental and ionic mercury in the environment. Volumes are expected to increase compared to 2022 due to the continued successful execution of growth projects, assuming continued availability of raw materials like chlorine. In addition, Specialties’ ongoing cost savings initiatives and higher pricing are expected to offset higher freight and raw material costs such as lithium chloride.
On a longer-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets. The combination of our solid, long-term business fundamentals, strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material costs should enable us to manage our business through end-market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets.
Ketjen (Catalysts): Total Ketjen results in 2023 are expected to increase year-over-year despite inflationary pressures in freight and input costs, including the volatility of natural gas pricing in Europe related to the war in Ukraine. These higher costs are expected to be offset by higher pricing in refining markets. Volume is expected to grow across each of the Ketjen businesses. The fluidized catalytic cracking (“FCC”) market has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased travel and depletion of global gasoline inventories. Hydroprocessing catalysts (“HPC”) demand tends to be lumpier than FCC demand, but is expected to see a prolonged recovery due to refineries pushing out turnarounds. In addition, the Ketjen business is seeking contingent business interruption insurance settlements for lost income from 2019 to 2022 due to multiple incidents with one of its customers. If we prevail with these claims, we could receive these settlements in multiple distributions in 2023, totaling up to an additional $47 million. Our decision to retain this business as a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary is intended to better meet customer needs and foster talent required to deliver in a competitive global environment.
On a longer-term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels, new refinery start-ups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our Ketjen business. We believe delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry. We also believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, including those managing new contaminants present in North America tight oil, and those in the Middle East and Asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields. Longer-term, we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour, a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio. With superior technology and production capacities, and expected growth in end market demand, we believe that Ketjen remains well-positioned for the future. In performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”), we expect growth on a longer-term basis in our organometallics business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending.
Corporate: We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the United States, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, and other tax jurisdictions.

Segment Information Overview. We have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. During 2022, our reportable business segments consisted of: (1) Lithium, (2) Bromine and (3) Catalysts.
Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. The “All Other” category included only the FCS business that did not fit into any of the Company’s core businesses. On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the FCS business. Amounts in the “All Other” category represent activity in this business until divested on June 1, 2021.

The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit (“Non-operating pension and OPEB items”) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs.

Our chief operating decision maker uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. These non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration-related costs, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, certain litigation and arbitration costs and charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. We reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Total adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Estimates, Assumptions and Reclassifications
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements.
Property, Plant and Equipment. We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
Acquisition Method of Accounting. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation

63

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates, among other items. When acquiring mineral reserves, the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation. Management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected production of the mine over the estimated time period, sales prices, shipment volumes, and expected profit margins. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes. We assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings, and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances. Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and (iii) the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility.
Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers. A performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer. The transaction price of a contract, or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments, if applicable, for any variable consideration, such as customer rebates, noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer, although these adjustments are generally not material. Where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts. Any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material. Standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers, which in some cases are based on established market prices. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. Our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days, however, they vary by market factors, such as customer size, creditworthiness, geography and competitive environment.
All of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers, and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices, while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs.
The Company currently utilizes the following practical expedients, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
•All sales and other pass-through taxes are excluded from contract value;
•In utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year;
•We will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component (which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income) unless, if at contract inception, the expected payment terms (from time of delivery or other relevant criterion) are more than one year;

64

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

•If our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance, we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right; and
•We expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costs/compensation attributable to individual product sales/shipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less.
Certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer. In management’s judgment, control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time (upon shipment or delivery) and not over the time they are produced. Therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products.
Costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less. When the Company incurs pre-production or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable, such costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which is less than one year. We record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized.
We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. In applying the goodwill impairment test, we initially perform a qualitative test (“Step 0”), where we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform a quantitative test (“Step 1”). During Step 1, we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows. Future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate as well as other economic or industry-related factors. For the Refining Solutions reporting unit, the revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margins and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. We use a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. Our WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. The factors in this calculation are largely external to Albemarle and, therefore, are beyond our control. We perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis. We test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2022 and no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis. As a result, we concluded there was no impairment as of that date. However, if the adjusted EBITDA or discount rate estimates for the Refining Solutions reporting unit negatively changed by 10%, the Refining Solutions fair value would be below its carrying value.
We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names and trademarks, for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if we determine, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis for our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents and customer lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years. Except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our Lithium business, which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method,

65

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We evaluate the recovery of our definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. See Note 12, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
Under authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and OPEB plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date. The primary assumptions are as follows:
•Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.
•Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently.
•Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.
•Mortality Assumptions—Assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a monthly basis. The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement.
During 2022, we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions.
Our U.S. defined benefit plans for non-represented employees are closed to new participants, with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen. In selecting the discount rates for the U.S. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For 2022, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2022 measurement date.
In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we look at long-term yields on AA-rated corporate bonds when available. Our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates, particularly at the longer durations. For the Eurozone, we apply the Aon Hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate. For the U.K., the discount rate is determined by applying the Aon Hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of Albemarle’s U.K. plan. In other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of high-quality corporate bonds, we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration.
At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign pension plans increased to 5.46% and 4.04%, respectively, from 2.86% and 1.44%, respectively, at December 31, 2021 to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2022 measurement date. The discount rate for the OPEB plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 5.45% and 2.85%, respectively.
In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments. For the years 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 6.89%, and the weighted-average expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 3.85% and 3.98%, respectively. Effective January 1, 2023, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. and foreign pension plan assets is 6.88% and 4.86%, respectively.

In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of changes in inflation rates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.67% and 3.20%, respectively, for our foreign pension plans.

 For the purpose of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, we used the Pri-2012 Mortality Tables along with the MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale, respectively, published by the SOA.
At December 31, 2022, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting January 1, 2013.
A variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued OPEB liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and OPEB cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions, primarily in the U.S. (in thousands):

------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------- ---------------------------------- ------- ---------------------------------------- ----- ---------------------------------- - ------ - -------
 (Favorable) Unfavorable
 1% Increase 1% Decrease
 Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Cost Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Cost
Actuarial Assumptions
Discount Rate:
Pension $ (60,603) $ 2,670 $ 71,494 $ (3,289)
Other postretirement benefits $ (2,822) $ 158 $ 3,293 $ (193)
Expected return on plan assets:
Pension * $ (5,066) * $ 5,066
Other postretirement benefits * $ — * $ —

* Not applicable.
Of the $528.1 million total pension and postretirement assets at December 31, 2022, $68.7 million, or approximately 13%, are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient. Gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets. See Note 15, “Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes
We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. In order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, we are following guidance under ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, along with any related valuation allowance. Tax effects are released from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized. We elected to not consider the estimated impact of potential future Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax liabilities for purposes of assessing valuation allowances on its deferred tax balances.
We only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in Income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to the statute of limitations, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years prior to 2019. Due to the statute of limitations, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state income tax audits prior to 2017.
With respect to jurisdictions outside the U.S., several audits are in process. We have audits ongoing for the years 2011 through 2022 in Germany, Italy, Belgium, South Africa, China, Canada and Chile, some of which are for entities that have since been divested.
While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
Since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. Our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $0.3 million as a result of closure of tax statutes. As a result of the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business in 2016, we agreed to indemnify certain income and non-income tax liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, associated with the entities sold. The associated liability is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities. See Note 16, “Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” and Note 21, “Income Taxes,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details.
We have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. Our foreign earnings are computed under U.S. federal tax earnings and profits (“E&P”) principles. In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration. The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested. We will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
Overview
The principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs, funding working capital, and service of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and have the ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances.
We are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, payables and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
Cash Flow
Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 as compared to $439.3 million at December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, $344.3 million and $798.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 versus 2021 was primarily due to significantly higher earnings from the Lithium and Bromine segments and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments, primarily from the Talison joint venture. This increase was partially offset by an increase in working capital outflow driven by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances from higher lithium pricing and increased sales. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to the $332.5 million payment to settle a prior legal matter, lower earnings from the FCS business sold on June 1, 2021, as well as increased inventory balances and accounts receivable due to the timing of payments. This was partially offset by increased sales in our Lithium and Bromine segments.
During 2022, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and the proceeds of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and credit agreements funded $1.3 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, the repayment of long-term debt

68

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

and credit agreements of $705.0 million, the net repayment of $391.7 million of commercial paper, the final payment of $332.5 million of a settlement of an arbitration ruling for a prior legal matter and dividends to shareholders of $184.4 million. During 2021, cash on hand, cash provided by operations, net cash proceeds of $289.8 million from the sale of the FCS business, $388.5 million of commercial paper borrowings and the $1.5 billion net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of common stock funded debt principal payments of approximately $1.5 billion, early extinguishment of debt fees of $24.9 million, $332.5 million of a settlement of an arbitration ruling for a prior legal matter, $953.7 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, dividends to shareholders of $177.9 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $30.3 million. During 2020, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of $200 million from one of our credit facilities funded $850.0 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, dividends to shareholders of $161.8 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $16.4 million. In addition, during 2020 we received $11.0 million in proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in the SOCC joint venture during and paid $22.6 million of agreed upon purchase price adjustments for the Wodgina Project acquisition. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our consolidated joint venture, JBC, declared dividends of $274.5 million, $274.6 million and $89.9 million, respectively, which resulted in dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $44.2 million ($53.1 million declared in 2022 was paid in the first quarter of 2023), $96.1 million and $32.1 million, respectively.
On October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Qinzhou, for approximately $200 million in cash, which includes a deferral of approximately $29 million to be paid in installments within a year of the acquisition closing date. Qinzhou's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tonnes of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.
On May 13, 2022, the Company issued a series of notes (collectively, the “2022 Notes”) as follows:
•$650.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 4.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 4.84%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2027.
•$600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.05% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.18%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2032.
•$450.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.65% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2022. The effective interest rate on these senior notes is approximately 5.71%. These senior notes mature on June 1, 2052.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes were used to repay the balance of the commercial paper notes, the remaining balance of $425.0 million of the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Notes were originally due to mature on December 15, 2024 and bore interest at a rate of 4.15%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million in Interest and financing expenses, representing the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2024 Notes. In addition, the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swap associated with the 2024 Notes from Accumulated other comprehensive income.
On June 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the FCS business to Grace for proceeds of approximately $570 million, consisting of $300 million in cash and the issuance to Albemarle of preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of $270 million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace’s option under certain conditions and will accrue payment-in-kind dividends at an annual rate of 12% beginning on June 1, 2023, two years after issuance.
On February 8, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 8,496,773 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $153.00 per share. We also granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,274,509 shares, which was exercised. The total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.5 billion, before deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions. In the first quarter of 2021, we made the following debt principal payments using the net proceeds from this underwritten public offering:
•€123.8 million of the 1.125% notes due in November 2025
•€393.0 million, the remaining balance, of the 1.875% Senior notes originally due in December 2021
•$128.4 million of the 3.45% senior notes due in November 2029
•$200.0 million, the remaining balance, of the floating rate notes originally due in November 2022

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

•€183.3 million, the outstanding balance, of the unsecured credit facility originally entered into on August 14, 2019, as amended and restated on December 15, 2020 (the “2019 Credit Facility”)
•$325.0 million, the outstanding balance, of the commercial paper notes
Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion, $953.7 million and $850.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were incurred mainly for plant, machinery and equipment. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion in 2023 primarily for Energy Storage growth and capacity increases, including in Australia, Chile, China and Silver Peak, Nevada, as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. Our La Negra, Chile plant has completed the qualification stage and is running as expected. Train I of our Kemerton, Western Australia plant is complete and ramping through the commissioning stage. Train II has achieved mechanical completion and transitioned to the commissioning stage, with commercial sales volume from Train II expected to begin in 2023. In addition, construction of our announced lithium conversion plant in Meishan, China is progressing on schedule, with estimated completion by the end of 2024.
The Company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15,000,000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. There were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2022, 2021 or 2020. At December 31, 2022, there were 7,396,263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program.
Net current assets increased to approximately $2.4 billion at December 31, 2022 from $119.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents from the issuance of the 2022 Notes, as well as increased inventory and accounts receivable balances from higher lithium pricing. Additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates. The additional changes are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents included $1.3 billion and $374.0 million, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we repatriated approximately $1.7 million, $0.9 million and $1.8 million of cash, respectively, as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities.
While we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending, including business acquisitions, share repurchases and other cash outlays, should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand, with additional cash needed, if any, provided by borrowings. The amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements.

(a)    Denotes senior notes.
Our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default.
Our Euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations. The Euro notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured notes before their maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis using the bond rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 35 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding $100 million caused by a nonpayment default.
On October 28, 2022, we amended our revolving, unsecured credit agreement (the “2018 Credit Agreement”), which provides for borrowings of up to $1.5 billion and matures on October 28, 2027. The 2018 Credit Agreement was originally dated as of June 21, 2018, and was previously amended on August 14, 2019, May 11, 2020 and December 10, 2021. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910% to 1.375%, depending on the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services LLC (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”). With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a term SOFR adjustment of 0.10%, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.125% as of December 31, 2022. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022.
On August 14, 2019, the Company entered into a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility with several banks and other financial institutions, which was amended and restated on December 15, 2020 and again on December 10, 2021 (the “2019 Credit Facility”). On October 24, 2022, the 2019 Credit Facility was terminated, with the outstanding balance of $250 million repaid using cash on hand.
Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The Company is subject to one financial covenant, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenant requires that the Company’s consolidated net funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio (as such terms are defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to 3.50:1 for all fiscal quarters, subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Credit Agreement relating to a consummation of an acquisition where the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of $500 million. The 2018 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2018 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the 2018 Credit Agreement being terminated.
On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”) from time-to-time up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $750.0 million. The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The 2018

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $1.5 billion current maximum amount available under the 2018 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. There were no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022.
When constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we may have the opportunity to enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. Under these agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to repurchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets are recorded in property, plant and equipment. We currently have the ability to transfer up to $540 million in assets under these arrangements, however, at December 31, 2022, there are no amounts outstanding under these arrangements.
The non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program and the 2018 Credit Agreement, and $179.0 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under the 2018 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that as of December 31, 2022 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. For additional information about our long-term debt obligations, see Note 14, “Long-Term Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately $142.3 million at December 31, 2022. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
Liquidity Outlook
We anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases, make acquisitions, make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Our main focus in the short-term, during the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economy, including caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflationary trends, is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by continuing our cost savings initiative, while still protecting our employees and customers, committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating. Over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity.
Our growth investments include the recently completed acquisition all of the outstanding equity of Qinzhou for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou's operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant that has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tons of LCE and is capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. In addition, we announced agreements for a strategic investment in China with plans to build a battery grade lithium conversion plant in Meishan initially targeting 50,000 metric tons of LCE per year. Construction of the Meishan facility is currently underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2024.
In October 2022, we announced we had been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina, location. We expect the concentrator facility to create hundreds of construction and full-time jobs, and to supply up to 350,000 metric tons per year of spodumene concentrate to our previously announced mega-flex lithium conversion facility.

Overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before November 2025, we believe we have, and will be able to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our annual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions): 2023—$2.1; 2024—$0.0; 2025—$401.3; 2026—$0.0; 2027—$650.0; thereafter—$2,192.4. In addition, we expect to make interest payments on those long-term debt obligations as follows (in millions): 2023—$124.5; 2024—$124.5; 2025—$124.1; 2026—$119.8; 2027—$102.3; thereafter—$1,098.5. For variable-rate debt obligations, projected interest payments are calculated using the December 31, 2022 weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.07%.
In addition, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion in 2023, primarily for Energy Storage growth and capacity increases, including in Australia, Chile, China and Silver Peak, Nevada, as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. As of December 31, 2022, we have also committed to approximately $350.7 million of payments to third-party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes, with approximately $161.2 million to be paid in 2023. In order to secure materials, sometimes for long durations, these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe.
See Note 18, “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for our annual expected payments under our operating lease obligations at December 31, 2022.
In 2023, we expect to pay $41.8 million of the $233.5 million balance remaining from the transition tax on foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law in December 2017. The one-time transition tax imposed by the TCJA is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and is payable over an eight-year period, with the final payment made in 2026.
Contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including our supplemental executive retirement plan, are expected to approximate $15 million in 2023. We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We made contributions of approximately $13.4 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the year ended December 31, 2022.
The liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled $83.7 million and $27.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled $32.4 million and $32.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time.
Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions, continuing inflationary trends and reduced capital availability. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our liquidity to date; however, we cannot predict the overall impact in terms of cash flow generation as that will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak and any future pandemics and its and their impact. As a result, we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed.
Although we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us, decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandamic or global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. If the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to continue tightening the monetary supply, we may incur increased borrowing costs (as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations), although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits.
On February 6, 2017, Huntsman International LLC (“Huntsman”), a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation, filed a lawsuit in New York state court against Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”), Rockwood Specialties, Inc., certain former executives of Rockwood and its subsidiaries, Seifollah Ghasemi, Thomas Riordan, Andrew Ross, and Michael Valente, and Albemarle. The lawsuit arises out of Huntsman’s acquisition of certain Rockwood subsidiaries in connection with a stock purchase agreement (the “SPA”), dated September 17, 2013. Before that transaction closed on October 1, 2014, Albemarle began discussions with Rockwood to purchase all outstanding equity of Rockwood and did so in a transaction that closed on

73

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

January 12, 2015. Huntsman’s complaint asserted that certain technology that Rockwood had developed for a production facility in Augusta, Georgia, and which was among the assets that Huntsman acquired pursuant to the SPA, did not work, and that Rockwood and the defendant executives had intentionally misled Huntsman about that technology in connection with the Huntsman-Rockwood transaction. The complaint asserted claims for, among other things, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of the SPA, and sought certain costs for completing construction of the production facility.
On March 10, 2017, Albemarle moved in New York state court to compel arbitration, which was granted on January 8, 2018 (although Huntsman unsuccessfully appealed that decision). Huntsman’s arbitration demand asserted claims substantially similar to those asserted in its state court complaint, and sought various forms of legal remedies, including cost overruns, compensatory damages, expectation damages, punitive damages, and restitution. After a trial, the arbitration panel issued an award on October 28, 2021, awarding approximately $600 million (including interest) to be paid by Albemarle to Huntsman, in addition to the possibility of attorney’s fees, costs and expenses. Following the arbitration panel decision, Albemarle reached a settlement with Huntsman to pay $665 million in two equal installments, with the first payment made in December 2021. The second and final payment of $332.5 million was made in May 2022. As a result, the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes expense of $657.4 million ($508.5 million net of income tax), inclusive of estimated possible legal fees incurred by Huntsman and other related obligations, to reflect the increase in liabilities for this legal matter.
As first reported in 2018, following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other potentially applicable laws. Based on this internal investigation, we have voluntarily self-reported potential issues relating to the use of third-party sales representatives in our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the SEC, and the Dutch Public Prosecutor (“DPP”), and are cooperating with the DOJ, the SEC, and the DPP in their review of these matters. In connection with our internal investigation, we have implemented, and are continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures. We have commenced discussions with the SEC, DOJ and DPP about a potential resolution of these matters.
At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope, result, or related costs associated with the investigations. We also are unable to predict what action may be taken by the DOJ, the SEC, or the DPP, or what penalties or remedial actions they may ultimately seek. Any determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses. We do not believe, however, that any such fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period.
We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, of which $1.3 billion is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access. The cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program.

Guarantor Financial Information
Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd Issued Notes
Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “3.45% Senior Notes”) in November 2019. The 3.45% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) on a senior unsecured basis by Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Guarantor”). No direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor guarantee the 3.45% Senior Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”).
In 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 60% interest in MRL’s Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project (“Wodgina Project”) in Western Australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with MRL, named MARBL Lithium Joint Venture, for the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals (other than iron ore and tantalum) from the Wodgina spodumene mine and for the operation of the Kemerton assets in Western Australia. We participate in the Wodgina Project through our ownership interest in the Issuer.
The Parent Guarantor conducts its U.S. Bromine and Catalysts operations directly, and conducts its other operations (other than operations conducted through the Issuer) through the Non-Guarantors.

74

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

The 3.45% Senior Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Issuer, effectively subordinated to all of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. The Guarantee is the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent Guarantor and ranks equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, effectively subordinated to the secured debt of the Parent Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries.
For cash management purposes, the Parent Guarantor transfers cash among itself, the Issuer and the Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Issuer and/or the Parent Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
The following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a Non-Guarantor. Each entity in the combined financial information follows the same accounting policies as described herein.

(d)    Includes non-current payables to Non-Guarantors of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2022.
The 3.45% Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Non-Guarantors. The Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the 3.45% Senior Notes or the Indenture under which the 3.45% Senior Notes were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Parent Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Non-Guarantor, and the consequent rights of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of a Non-Guarantor’s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Non-Guarantor’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of

75

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

preferred equity interests, if any, of such Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Non-Guarantors, the Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Parent Guarantor.
The 3.45% Senior Notes are obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer’s cash flow and ability to make payments on the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings it derives from the production from MARBL for the Wodgina Project. Absent income received from sales of its share of production from MARBL, the Issuer’s ability to service the 3.45% Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries and other joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to the Issuer in the form of equity, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from the Issuer.
The Issuer’s obligations in respect of MARBL are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor. Further, under MARBL pursuant to a deed of cross security between the Issuer, the joint venture partner and the manager of the project (the “Manager”), each of the Issuer, and the joint venture partner have granted security to each other and the Manager for the obligations each of the Issuer and the joint venture partner have to each other and to the Manager. The claims of the joint venture partner, the Manager and other secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority as to the assets of the Issuer over the claims of holders of the 3.45% Senior Notes.
Albemarle Corporation Issued Notes
In March 2021, Albemarle New Holding GmbH (the “Subsidiary Guarantor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, added a full and unconditional guarantee (the “Upstream Guarantee”) to all securities of Albemarle Corporation (the “Parent Issuer”) issued and outstanding as of such date and, subject to the terms of the applicable amendment or supplement, securities issuable by the Parent Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”). No other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer guarantee these securities (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Upstream Non-Guarantors”). See Long-term debt section above for a description of the securities issued by the Parent Issuer.
The current securities outstanding under the Indenture are the Parent Issuer’s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Parent Issuer. All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture are effectively subordinated to the Parent Issuer’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. With respect to any series of securities issued under the Indenture that is subject to the Upstream Guarantee (which series of securities does not include the 2022 Notes), the Upstream Guarantee is, and will be, an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor, ranking pari passu with all other existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor. All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture (other than the 2022 Notes) are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries other than the Subsidiary Guarantor. The 2022 Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent’s Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Guarantor.
For cash management purposes, the Parent Issuer transfers cash among itself, the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Upstream Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Parent Issuer and/or the Subsidiary Guarantor’s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Parent Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
The following tables present summarized financial information for the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Parent Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is an Upstream Non-Guarantor.

These securities are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Upstream Non-Guarantors. The Upstream Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to these securities or the Indenture under which these securities were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments.

Safety and Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not currently expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any

77

--------------------------------------
Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
Our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were $46.3 million, $43.2 million and $44.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. Costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at December 31, 2022 totaled approximately $38.2 million, a decrease of $8.4 million from $46.6 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis, although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period.
Capital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $75.6 million, $55.4 million and $40.4 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the future, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals. Management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (a) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and (b) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.

In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...
