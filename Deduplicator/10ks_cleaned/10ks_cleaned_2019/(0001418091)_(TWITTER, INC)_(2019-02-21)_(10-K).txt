Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Key Metrics

We review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We believe that mDAU, and its related growth, are the best ways to measure our success against our objectives and to show the size of our audience and engagement going forward, so we will discontinue disclosing MAU after the first quarter of 2019.

Monetizable Daily Active Usage (monetizable DAU or mDAU). We define monetizable daily active usage or users (mDAU) as Twitter users who logged in and accessed Twitter on any given day through a client capable of displaying ads (e.g., Twitter.com or the Twitter App). Our definition and calculation of mDAU is the same as that of the DAU data presented since the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in active user base. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year.

In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 126 million average mDAUs, which represents an increase of 9% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by a combination of organic growth, marketing, and product improvements. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 27 million average mDAUs in the United States and 99 million average mDAUs in the rest of the world, which represent increases of 5% and 11%, respectively, from the three months ended December 31, 2017.

For additional information on how we calculate changes in mDAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled “Note Regarding Key Metrics.”

52

Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define MAUs as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. MAUs are a measure of the size of our logged in or otherwise authenticated active user base. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 321 million average MAUs, which represents a decrease of 3% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. MAU growth is historically seasonally weak in the fourth quarter. The decrease in average MAUs was driven by a number of factors, including product changes that reduced the number of email notifications sent, as well as decisions we have made to prioritize the health of the service and not to move to paid SMS carrier relationships in certain markets, and, to a lesser extent, changes we made to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 66 million average MAUs in the United States and 255 million average MAUs in the rest of the world, which each represent decreases of 3%, from the three months ended December 31, 2017. For additional information on how we calculate MAUs and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled “Note Regarding Key Metrics.” As we announced on February 7, 2019, mDAU will be the metric we use to show the size of our audience and engagement going forward, so we will discontinue disclosing MAU after the first quarter of 2019.

 (1) Reported average Monthly Active Users reflects adjustments for approximately 1-2 million users per quarter of certain third-party applications that were included as Twitter MAUs that should not have been considered MAUs in certain prior periods. Daily Active Usage was not affected. Further details regarding the adjustment can be found in the section titled "Note About Our MAU Adjustment."

(2) In the three months ended March 31, 2018, we discovered that a software change made in the second quarter of 2017 resulted in a non-material overstatement of our historical MAU in 2017. The differences were between 30,000 and 400,000 in each period presented for total MAU. After rounding, the only impact to our prior disclosures was to reduce international MAU from 261 million to 260 million in the third quarter of 2017 due to a change of approximately 175,000 international MAUs.

53

Changes in Ad Engagements and Cost per Ad Engagement. We define an ad engagement as a user interaction with one of our pay-for-performance advertising products. Ad engagements with our advertising products are based on a user completing an objective set out by an advertiser such as expanding, Retweeting, liking or replying to a Promoted Tweet, viewing an embedded video, downloading or engaging with a promoted mobile application, clicking on a website link, signing up for marketing emails from advertisers, following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet, or completing a transaction on an external website. We believe changes in ad engagements is one way to measure user engagement with our advertising products. We believe changes in cost per ad engagement is one way to measure demand.

In the three months ended December 31, 2018, ad engagements increased 33% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increased demand and improved clickthrough rates (CTR), which grew on a year-over-year basis across the majority of ad types as our ad prediction models and video ad product performance continues to improve. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, cost per ad engagement decreased 7% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects higher CTR from improved relevance, an ongoing shift to video ads, which carry higher CTR and lower CPE, and slight compression in like for like pricing. With improved CTR, advertisers are able to get the same amount of engagements (or more) at a lower (or similar) price.

Factors Affecting Our Future Performance

User Growth and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the growth rate of mDAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.

User Growth. We have generally experienced growth in our number of mDAU over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States and Japan use Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets.

We intend to grow mDAU by building and shipping product changes more rapidly to make Twitter safer and investing in our core use case and in new product areas that further strengthen our unique position as the best and fastest place to see and talk about what’s happening in the world. Our mDAU growth rate has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline. To the extent our mDAU growth or growth rate slows or the absolute number of mDAU declines, our revenue growth will become dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on Twitter and increasing revenue growth from third-party publishers’ websites and applications, data licensing and other offerings.

54

Monetization.  There are many variables that impact the monetization of our platform, such as the number of users, our users’ level of engagement with our platform, ad load (which is a function of the amount of advertising we choose to display), our users’ engagement with our Promoted Products, advertiser demand and cost per ad engagement. Generally, we design our algorithms for our pay-for-performance Promoted Products on Twitter to optimize the overall user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers. Advertising revenue growth may be impacted by escalating competition for digital ad spending and the reevaluation of our revenue product feature portfolio, which could result in the de-emphasis of certain product features. Furthermore, we may see a decline in the number of advertisers on a year-over-year basis, which may also impact overall demand for our ads products. We have, and may in the future, increase ad load to the extent that we are able to continue to reach the right balance of advertiser value and the overall user experience. In order to improve monetization, we plan to increase the value of our advertising services by continuing to increase the size and engagement of our user base as well as improve our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns.

Although the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we have augmented our advertising revenue by selling products that we place on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings. When we place ads off our owned and operated properties, we incur additional costs, particularly traffic acquisition costs, to fulfill our services to advertisers.

We intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, delivering differentiated products to advertisers, and developing new ad formats for advertisers.

Effectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers, as well as providing better measurement tools and improving creative capabilities, will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services.

Investment in International Operations. We intend to strategically invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 99 million average mDAUs internationally compared to 27 million average mDAUs in the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 255 million average MAUs internationally compared to 66 million average MAUs in the United States. International growth of mDAUs has been faster than growth in the United States; however, we derive approximately half of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States.

We face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation.

55

Competition. We face competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. In recent years there has been a significant number of acquisitions and consolidation activity by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services and the actual or perceived return our advertisers receive on their investment in our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively for advertisers also depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities, the size of our active user base, and our ability to have the most valuable audience when they are most receptive. We have seen competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. In addition, many advertisers, particularly branded advertisers use marketing mix analyses to determine how to allocate their advertising budgets on an annual or bi-annual basis. As a result, we need to demonstrate to those advertisers during the appropriate time period that we provide a better return on investment than our competitors do in order to secure, increase or sustain our share of the advertising budget allocated for a significant portion of the year until the next budget cycle. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies.

Investment in Infrastructure. We strive to optimize the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion and improvement of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure, increased bandwidth costs, and costs to secure our customers’ data.

Products and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We will continue to invest in revenue products as we work to improve our ads platform and ad formats to help our ad partners launch new products and services and connect with what’s happening on Twitter. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities. In addition, we continue to invest in health as we continue our work to help people find credible information on our service and feel safe participating in the conversation on Twitter.

Investment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring key engineering roles and retaining talented employees to grow our business.   We have seen reduced levels of attrition in 2018, but we need to continue to focus on hiring and employee retention to be successful. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.

Seasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 17%, 28% and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2017 and 2018 decreased 26% and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, respectively.

56

Stock-Based Compensation Expense. We have historically utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, various forms of stock-based awards in order to hire and retain talented employees. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $326.2 million and $433.8 million of expense related to stock-based compensation, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $715.0 million related to outstanding equity awards, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The stock-based compensation expenses related to our outstanding equity awards have a significant impact on the amount of net income we generate on a GAAP basis. We made significant progress in reducing our annual stock-based compensation expense on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue, down to 11% in 2018, from 18% and 24% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We remain committed to maintaining stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue in line with our peers.

Revenue

We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services.

Advertising Services

We generate most of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:

 • Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear within a user’s timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users’ interest graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Tweets include objective-based features that allow advertisers to pay only for the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views.

 • Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as “promoted,” provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. Our Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising that is priced through an auction.

 • Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis.

While the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we also generate advertising revenue by placing advertising products that we sell to advertisers on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings.

58

Data Licensing and Other

We generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data products and data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services through our MoPub exchange. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period. We recognize data licensing revenue as our data partners consume and benefit from their continuous use of the licensed data over time. In addition, we operate a mobile ad exchange and receive service fees from transactions completed on the exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal as it relates to our performance obligation of providing an ad exchange service in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017
------------------------ ----------------------- --------- ------------ - --------- ------------ - --------- -------- -- - -- --
 2018 2017 2016 % Change % Change
 (in thousands)
Advertising services $ 2,617,397 $ 2,109,987 $ 2,248,052 24 % (6 )%
Data licensing and other 424,962 333,312 281,567 27 % 18 %
Total revenue $ 3,042,359 $ 2,443,299 $ 2,529,619 25 % (3 )%

2018 Compared to 2017. Revenue in 2018 increased by $599.1 million compared to 2017.

In 2018, advertising revenue increased by 24% compared to 2017. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2018 was $2.46 billion as compared to $1.90 billion in 2017. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2018 was $154.4 million as compared to $211.2 million in 2017.

The overall increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 55% increase in the number of ad engagements offset by a 20% decrease in cost per ad engagement in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in ad engagements was driven by increased demand and improved clickthrough rates. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects the ongoing mix shift to video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats), higher clickthrough rates, and a slight compression in like for like pricing.

The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2018 was driven primarily by the lack of contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017). TellApart revenue contributed $44.6 million in revenue in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, and was fully deprecated in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Advertising revenue continued to be driven by continued sales momentum with advertisers, built around our differentiated ad formats, better relevance, and improved ROI. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.

In 2018, data licensing and other revenue increased by 27% compared to 2017. A majority of the increase was attributable to expanded and new partnerships.

Looking ahead, while data licensing and other revenue continues to benefit from customers developing new use cases and smaller customers adopting self-service APIs, we are now largely through our multi-year enterprise renewal cycle. As a result, with many of our largest partners now at market pricing, revenue growth is likely to moderate in 2019.

59

2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 decreased by $86.3 million compared to 2016.

In 2017, advertising revenue decreased by 6% compared to 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2017 was $1.90 billion as compared to $1.99 billion in 2016. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was $211.2 million as compared to $260.2 million in 2016. The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was driven by significantly lower contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017), which was offset by strong performance from Twitter Audience Platform. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.

The overall decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 52% decrease in cost per ad engagement offset by a 96% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in ad engagements was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher clickthrough rates.

Advertising revenue continued to be driven by strong growth in our video ad formats offset by declines in traditional Promoted Tweet and direct response ad formats.

In 2017, data licensing and other revenue increased by 18% compared to 2016. A majority of the increase was attributable to growth in data licensing fees from the offering of data products.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes infrastructure costs, other direct costs including content costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of capitalized labor costs for internally developed software, allocated facilities costs, as well as traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. Infrastructure costs consist primarily of data center costs related to our co-located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs; as well as depreciation of servers and networking equipment; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. TAC consists of costs we incur with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions, and from our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. Certain of the elements of our cost of revenue are fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term.

The increase was attributable to an $89.3 million increase in direct costs, primarily driven by an increase in content costs and a $50.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.  These increases were offset by a $35.3 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the lack of advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $0.6 million decrease in other expenses.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, cost of revenue decreased by $71.0 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $48.6 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $45.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs, a $42.7 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the decrease in advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs. These decreases were offset by a $55.5 million increase in other direct costs that is primarily driven by an increase in content costs, and a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.

60

We plan to continue to scale the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, research and development expenses increased by $11.8 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $15.4 million net increase in allocated facilities costs, other supporting overhead expenses, and other expenses, and the absence of a $12.1 million one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were offset by a $8.7 million net decrease in personnel-related costs driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due partially to forfeitures offset in part by an increase in average employee headcount, and a $7.0 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, research and development expenses decreased by $171.5 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $141.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.9 million decrease in restructuring charges net of a one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets in 2017, a $23.7 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses, and a $2.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $24.8 million decrease in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.

We plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business to ensure that we have the right level of engineering, product management and design personnel and related resources to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, sales and marketing expenses increased by $53.9 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $36.2 million net increase in allocated facilities costs and other supporting overhead expenses, a $9.3 million increase in marketing and sales-related expenses, and a $23.9 million net increase in personnel-related costs driven by an increase in average employee headcount offset in part by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were offset by a $15.5 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $240.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $116.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, driven by a decrease in average employee headcount mainly as a result of our 2016 restructuring plan, a $54.0 million decrease in marketing and sales-related expenses, a $28.0 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $27.4 million decrease in restructuring expenses, and a $15.0 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets.

We continue to evaluate key areas in our business to ensure we have the right level of sales and marketing to execute on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that sales and marketing costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including consulting, third-party legal and accounting services and facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, general and administrative expense increased by $14.9 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $24.6 million net increase in personnel-related costs driven by an increase in average employee headcount offset in part by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, and a $7.9 million increase in professional service fees. These increases were offset by a $17.6 million decrease in allocated facilities costs, other supporting overhead expenses, and other expenses.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, general and administrative expense decreased by $9.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $9.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $4.9 million decrease in facilities and supporting costs, and a $4.8 million decrease in restructuring charges. The decreases were offset by a $9.0 million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.

We plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business and ensure that we have the right level of general and administrative support on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

Interest expense $ 132,606 $ 105,237 $ 99,968

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, interest expense increased by $27.4 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes in June 2018. Interest expense in 2018 was comprised of $127.7 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility (described below) and $4.9 million related to capital leases of equipment.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, interest expense increased by $5.3 million compared to 2016. Interest expense in 2017 was comprised of $99.6 million of total interest expense related to the Notes as well as our credit facility (described below) and $5.6 million related to capital leases of equipment.

Interest Income

Interest income is generated from our cash equivalents and short-term investments net of the related amortization of premium paid on such investments.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, interest income increased by $66.8 million compared to 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, interest income increased by $20.1 million compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net, consists of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, realized foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions, and gains and losses on investments in privately-held companies. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, other expense, net, was $8.4 million compared to other expense, net, of $73.3 million in 2017. The change was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a $62.4 million impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2017, and the more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.

63

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, other expense, net, was $73.3 million compared to other income, net, of $2.1 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the recording of an impairment charge on an investment in a privately-held company of $62.4 million in 2017 and less favorable foreign currency exchange impacts from foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the provision is impacted by deferred income taxes and changes in the related valuation allowance reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as our valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets. Also in December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We completed our accounting for the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018, within the one-year measurement period from the enactment. Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (782,052 ) $ 12,645 $ 16,039

2018 Compared to 2017. Our benefit for income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $782.1 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of $12.6 million in 2017. Our current provision for income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $19.7 million, compared to a current provision of $19.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Our deferred benefit for income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $801.7 million, compared to a deferred benefit for income taxes of $6.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The change is due to the release of our valuation allowance of $845.1 million related to Brazil and most of the United States federal and all states deferred tax assets with the exception of California and Massachusetts, offset by our current year income tax expense of $63.0 million, compared to a provision of $12.6 million in 2017. Excluding the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, the change was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax profitability offset by an increase to the benefit of share-based compensation.

2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 decreased by $3.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the income tax benefit arising from intraperiod allocation and partial release of valuation allowance attributable to the Tax Act related to alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits.

We anticipate that going forward we will have income tax expense, which amounts could be affected by our jurisdictional mix of profit before taxes, the extent foreign earnings are taxed in the United States through new provisions under the Tax Act, changes in tax rates and tax regulations, the impact of tax examinations, the impact of business combinations, tax effects of share based compensation, and changes in the remaining valuation allowances.

Credit Facility

In August 2018, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $500.0 million revolving unsecured credit facility maturing on August 7, 2023. In connection with entering into the $500.0 million credit facility, we also terminated our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the new credit facility and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee. The interest rate for the new credit facility is determined based on calculations using certain market rates as set forth in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been drawn under the credit facility.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data:
Net income (loss) $ 1,205,596 $ (108,063 ) $ (456,873 )
Net cash provided by operating activities 1,339,711 831,209 763,055
Net cash provided used in investing activities (2,055,513 ) (116,526 ) (593,248 )
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 978,116 (78,373 ) (83,975 )

 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in marketable securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. In June 2018, we also received net proceeds of approximately $1.14 billion from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, after deducting the debt issuance costs. Concurrent with the sales of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common stock for which we paid approximately $268.0 million and sold warrants for which we received approximately $186.8 million.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $6.21 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities, of which $210.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. During the SAB 118 period related to the Tax Act, we re-assessed our intentions related to certain of these funds held by our foreign subsidiaries in light of the reduced tax associated with repatriation. We have determined that we will no longer be indefinitely reinvested related to these funds and accrued the incremental foreign withholding taxes. In addition, we have a revolving unsecured credit facility available to borrow up to $500.0 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance, and our credit facility, together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, and to repay the $936.2 million of principal and coupon interest associated with our 2019 Notes due in September 2019.

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of discount on our Notes, deferred income taxes, impairment of investments in privately-held companies, non-cash restructuring charges, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our revenue, increases in operating expenses and costs related to acquisitions. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1A,”Risk Factors.”

Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $1.34 billion, an increase in cash inflow of $508.5 million compared to 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of $1.21 billion, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $44.8 million, of which the most significant items were a $845.1 million net benefit to tax expense associated with the release of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, $425.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and $326.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash inflows of $89.3 million, which was in part driven by a one-time refund of prepaid employment taxes of $147.5 million.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $831.2 million, an increase in cash inflow of $68.2 million compared to 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $108.1 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $971.5 million, of which the most significant items were $433.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $395.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $62.4 million of impairment charges on an investment in a privately-held company, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflows of $32.2 million.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was $763.1 million, an increase in cash inflow of $380.0 million compared to 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $456.9 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments totaling $1.14 billion, of which the most significant items were $615.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $82.6 million.

67

Investing Activities

Our primary investing activities consist of purchases of property and equipment, particularly purchases of servers and networking equipment, leasehold improvements for our facilities, purchases and disposal of marketable securities, strategic investments in privately-held companies, acquisitions of businesses and other activities.

Cash used in investing activities in 2018 was $2.06 billion, an increase in cash outflow of $1.94 billion compared to 2017. The change was primarily due to a $2.65 billion increase in purchases of marketable securities, a $323.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, an absence of $35.0 million in proceeds from sale of long-lived assets, and a net increase of $33.6 million in cash used in business combinations, offset by a $1.09 billion net increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, a $2.6 million decrease in expenditures on other investing activities and a $10.3 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment.

Cash used in investing activities in 2017 was $116.5 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $476.7 million compared to 2016. The change was primarily due to a $221.4 million decrease in the purchases of marketable securities, a $80.7 million decrease in purchases of investments in privately-held companies, a net $85.1 million decrease in cash used in business combinations, a $57.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, a $35.0 million increase in proceeds from sale of long-lived assets, a $2.8 million increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, and a $2.8 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment, offset by a $8.9 million increase in expenditures on other investing activities.

Cash used in investing activities in 2016 was $593.2 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $305.6 million compared to 2015. The decrease in cash outflow was due to decreased purchases of marketable securities of $774.9 million, property and equipment of $128.6 million and other investments of $9.9 million, offset by a decrease in sales and maturities of marketable securities of $503.4 million, an increase in purchase of investments in privately-held companies of $71.0 million, and an increase in use of cash as acquisition consideration of $33.4 million.

We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2019 of approximately $550 million to $600 million as we continue to expand our co-located data centers.

Financing Activities

Our primary financing activities consist of issuances of securities, including common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan, capital lease financing and stock option exercises by employees and other service providers.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $978.1 million, compared to $78.4 million cash used in financing activities in 2017. The change was due to net proceeds of $1.14 billion from the issuance of convertible notes net of issuance costs, reduced by the net cash outflow of $81.2 million from the purchase of convertible note hedges and sale of warrants closed in connection with the issuance of convertible notes, a $12.4 million decrease in payments of capital lease obligations, and a $5.4 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of shares of stock from the ESPP, offset by a $10.3 million increase in tax payments related to net share settlements of equity awards and a $6.0 million decrease in proceeds from option exercises.

Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $78.4 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $5.6 million compared to 2016. The decrease in cash outflow was due to a $6.4 million decrease in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and other activities and a $1.9 million increase in proceeds from option exercises. These decreases were offset by a $2.2 million increase in payments of capital lease obligations and a $0.5 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of shares of stock from ESPP.

Cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $84.0 million, an increase in cash outflow of $21.0 million compared to 2015. The increase in cash outflow was due to a $14.9 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of shares of stock from ESPP, a net $13.3 million increase in tax payments related to net share settlements of equity awards and other activities, and a net $9.8 million decrease in proceeds from option exercises, offset by a reduction in repayments of capital lease obligations of $17.0 million.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any such arrangements in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist of obligations under the Notes (including principal and coupon interest), capital and operating leases for equipment, office space and co-located data center facilities, as well as non-cancellable contractual commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2018.

(1) We have entered into several sublease agreements for office space that we are not fully utilizing. Under the sublease agreements, we will receive approximately $52.5 million in sublease income over the next four years.

(2) Other contractual commitments are non-cancelable contractual commitments primarily related to our infrastructure services, bandwidth and other services arrangements.

As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded liabilities of $17.9 million related to uncertain tax positions. Due to uncertainties in the timing of potential tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.

Revenue Recognition

We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services with the balance from data licensing and other arrangements.

We generate our advertising revenue primarily from the sale of our Promoted Products: (i) Promoted Tweets, (ii) Promoted Accounts and (iii) Promoted Trends. Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising products or pay on impressions delivered, each priced through an auction. Promoted Trends are featured by geography and offered on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. Advertisers are obligated to pay when a user engages with a Promoted Tweet, follows a Promoted Account, when an impression is delivered, or when a Promoted Trend is displayed. These advertising services may be sold in combination as a bundled arrangement or separately on a stand-alone basis.

69

For our Promoted Product arrangements, significant judgments are (i) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (ii) determining the basis for allocating contract consideration to performance obligations, (iii) determining whether we are the principal or the agent in arrangements where another party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, and (iv) estimating the transaction price to be allocated for contracts with tiered rebate provisions.

We may generate revenue from the sale of certain Promoted Tweets through placement by Twitter of advertiser ads against third-party publisher content. We will pay the third-party publisher a revenue share fee for our right to monetize their content. In such transactions, advertisers are contracting to obtain a single integrated advertising service, the Promoted Tweet combined with the third-party publisher content, and we obtain control of the third-party publisher content displayed on Twitter that we then combine with the advertiser ads within the Promoted Tweet. Therefore, we report advertising revenue generated from these transactions on a gross basis and record the related third-party content monetization fees as cost of revenue.

We also generate advertising revenue by selling services in which we place ads on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings. To fulfill these transactions, we purchase advertising inventory from third-party publishers’ websites and applications where we have identified the advertisers’ targeted audience and therefore incur traffic acquisition costs prior to transferring the advertising service to our customers. At such point, we have the sole ability to monetize the third-party publishers advertising inventory. In such transactions, we obtain control of a right to a service to be performed by the third-party publishers, which gives us the ability to direct those publishers to provide the services to our customers on our behalf. Therefore, we report advertising revenue generated from these transactions on a gross basis, and we record the related traffic acquisition costs as cost of revenue.

Fees for the advertising services above are recognized in the period when advertising is delivered as evidenced by a user engaging with a Promoted Tweet or an ad on a third-party publisher website or application in a manner satisfying the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., retweets, replies and likes), website clicks, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views, following a Promoted Account, delivery of impressions, or through the display of a Promoted Trend on our platform.

We have concluded that our data licensing arrangements, which grant customers a right to Twitter’s intellectual property (“IP”) for a defined period of time, may contain a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time (“Historical IP”) or over time (“Future IP”), or may contain two or more performance obligations satisfied separately at a point in time (Historical IP) and over time (Future IP). In some of our data licensing arrangements, pricing is a fixed monthly fee over a specified term. In arrangements with a single performance obligation satisfied over time, data licensing revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which we provide data as the customer consumes and benefits from the continuous data available on an ongoing basis. In arrangements with at least two performance obligations, we allocate revenue on a relative basis between the performance obligations based on standalone selling price (“SSP”) and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

In other data licensing arrangements, we charge customers based on the amount of sales they generate from downstream customers using Twitter data. Certain of those royalty-based data licensing arrangements are subject to minimum guarantees. For such arrangements with a minimum guarantee and a single Future IP performance obligation, we recognize revenue for minimum guarantees on a straight-line basis over the period in which we provide data. For such arrangements with a minimum guarantee and two or more performance obligations, we allocate revenue on a relative basis between the performance obligations based on SSP and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Royalties in excess of minimum guarantees, if any, are recognized as revenue in the period that the related downstream customer sales using our licensed data occur, and such amounts have been immaterial to date.

For data licensing arrangements involving two or more performance obligations, we use directly observable standalone transactions to determine SSP of Historical IP.  We use standalone transactions and consider all other reasonably available observable evidence to estimate SSP of Future IP.

Other revenue is primarily generated from service fees from transactions completed on our mobile ad exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory by matching them in the exchange. We have determined we are not the principal in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange because we do not obtain control of the advertising inventory. We report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis for the fees paid by buyers, net of costs related to acquiring the advertising inventory paid to sellers.

70

Arrangements involving multiple performance obligations primarily consist of combinations of our pay-for-performance products, Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts, which are priced through an auction, and Promoted Trends, which are priced on a fixed-fee-per day, per geography basis. For arrangements that include a combination of these products, we develop an estimate of the standalone selling price for these products in order to allocate any potential discount to all performance obligations in the arrangement. The estimate of standalone selling price for pay-for-performance auction based products is determined based on the winning bid price. The estimate of standalone selling price for Promoted Trends is based on Promoted Trends sold on a standalone basis and/or separately priced in a bundled arrangement by reference to a list price by geography, which is updated and approved periodically. For other arrangements involving multiple performance obligations where neither auction pricing nor standalone sales provide sufficient evidence of standalone selling price, we estimate standalone selling price using either an adjusted market assessment approach or an expected cost plus margin approach. We believe the use of our estimation approach and allocation of the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation results in revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction and the allocation principle included in Topic 606. We have elected to exclude certain sales and indirect taxes from the determination of the transaction price.

Income Taxes

 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision (benefit) for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.

We record a provision (benefit) for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.

We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. We record interest and penalties related to our uncertain tax positions in our provision (benefit) for income taxes.

The Tax Act contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the federal corporate as well as our valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We completed our accounting for the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018, within the one year-measurement period from the enactment date. We elected to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under the Tax Act as a period cost when the expense is incurred and apply the approach of tax law ordering for reflecting the realization of loss carryforward expected to offset future GILTI.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.

71

We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2018. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.

Business Combinations

We account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.

Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, estimated fair value of stock awards assumed from the acquirees that are included in the purchase price, estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquirees, and determination of the fair value of contractual obligations, where applicable. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we made at the time were reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2) In the three months ended March 31, 2018, we discovered that a software change made in the second quarter of 2017 resulted in a non-material overstatement of our historical MAU in 2017. The differences were between 30,000 and 400,000 in each period presented for total MAU. After rounding, the only impact to our prior disclosures was to reduce international MAU from 261 million to 260 million in the third quarter of 2017 due to a change of approximately 175,000 international MAUs.

53

Changes in Ad Engagements and Cost per Ad Engagement. We define an ad engagement as a user interaction with one of our pay-for-performance advertising products. Ad engagements with our advertising products are based on a user completing an objective set out by an advertiser such as expanding, Retweeting, liking or replying to a Promoted Tweet, viewing an embedded video, downloading or engaging with a promoted mobile application, clicking on a website link, signing up for marketing emails from advertisers, following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet, or completing a transaction on an external website. We believe changes in ad engagements is one way to measure user engagement with our advertising products. We believe changes in cost per ad engagement is one way to measure demand.

In the three months ended December 31, 2018, ad engagements increased 33% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by increased demand and improved clickthrough rates (CTR), which grew on a year-over-year basis across the majority of ad types as our ad prediction models and video ad product performance continues to improve. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, cost per ad engagement decreased 7% from the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects higher CTR from improved relevance, an ongoing shift to video ads, which carry higher CTR and lower CPE, and slight compression in like for like pricing. With improved CTR, advertisers are able to get the same amount of engagements (or more) at a lower (or similar) price.

Factors Affecting Our Future Performance

User Growth and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the growth rate of mDAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.

User Growth. We have generally experienced growth in our number of mDAU over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States and Japan use Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets.

We intend to grow mDAU by building and shipping product changes more rapidly to make Twitter safer and investing in our core use case and in new product areas that further strengthen our unique position as the best and fastest place to see and talk about what’s happening in the world. Our mDAU growth rate has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline. To the extent our mDAU growth or growth rate slows or the absolute number of mDAU declines, our revenue growth will become dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on Twitter and increasing revenue growth from third-party publishers’ websites and applications, data licensing and other offerings.

54

Monetization.  There are many variables that impact the monetization of our platform, such as the number of users, our users’ level of engagement with our platform, ad load (which is a function of the amount of advertising we choose to display), our users’ engagement with our Promoted Products, advertiser demand and cost per ad engagement. Generally, we design our algorithms for our pay-for-performance Promoted Products on Twitter to optimize the overall user experience and the value we deliver to advertisers. Advertising revenue growth may be impacted by escalating competition for digital ad spending and the reevaluation of our revenue product feature portfolio, which could result in the de-emphasis of certain product features. Furthermore, we may see a decline in the number of advertisers on a year-over-year basis, which may also impact overall demand for our ads products. We have, and may in the future, increase ad load to the extent that we are able to continue to reach the right balance of advertiser value and the overall user experience. In order to improve monetization, we plan to increase the value of our advertising services by continuing to increase the size and engagement of our user base as well as improve our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns.

Although the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we have augmented our advertising revenue by selling products that we place on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings. When we place ads off our owned and operated properties, we incur additional costs, particularly traffic acquisition costs, to fulfill our services to advertisers.

We intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, delivering differentiated products to advertisers, and developing new ad formats for advertisers.

Effectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers, as well as providing better measurement tools and improving creative capabilities, will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services.

Investment in International Operations. We intend to strategically invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 99 million average mDAUs internationally compared to 27 million average mDAUs in the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 255 million average MAUs internationally compared to 66 million average MAUs in the United States. International growth of mDAUs has been faster than growth in the United States; however, we derive approximately half of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States.

We face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation.

55

Competition. We face competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device-based products, services and content. In recent years there has been a significant number of acquisitions and consolidation activity by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services and the actual or perceived return our advertisers receive on their investment in our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively for advertisers also depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities, the size of our active user base, and our ability to have the most valuable audience when they are most receptive. We have seen competition for digital ad spending and expect this trend to continue. In addition, many advertisers, particularly branded advertisers use marketing mix analyses to determine how to allocate their advertising budgets on an annual or bi-annual basis. As a result, we need to demonstrate to those advertisers during the appropriate time period that we provide a better return on investment than our competitors do in order to secure, increase or sustain our share of the advertising budget allocated for a significant portion of the year until the next budget cycle. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies.

Investment in Infrastructure. We strive to optimize the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion and improvement of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure, increased bandwidth costs, and costs to secure our customers’ data.

Products and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We will continue to invest in revenue products as we work to improve our ads platform and ad formats to help our ad partners launch new products and services and connect with what’s happening on Twitter. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities. In addition, we continue to invest in health as we continue our work to help people find credible information on our service and feel safe participating in the conversation on Twitter.

Investment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring key engineering roles and retaining talented employees to grow our business.   We have seen reduced levels of attrition in 2018, but we need to continue to focus on hiring and employee retention to be successful. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.

Seasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 17%, 28% and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2017 and 2018 decreased 26% and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, respectively.

56

Stock-Based Compensation Expense. We have historically utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, various forms of stock-based awards in order to hire and retain talented employees. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $326.2 million and $433.8 million of expense related to stock-based compensation, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $715.0 million related to outstanding equity awards, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The stock-based compensation expenses related to our outstanding equity awards have a significant impact on the amount of net income we generate on a GAAP basis. We made significant progress in reducing our annual stock-based compensation expense on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue, down to 11% in 2018, from 18% and 24% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We remain committed to maintaining stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue in line with our peers.

Revenue

We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services.

Advertising Services

We generate most of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following:

 • Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear within a user’s timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users’ interest graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression delivered advertising that are priced through an auction. Our Promoted Tweets include objective-based features that allow advertisers to pay only for the types of engagement selected by the advertisers, such as Tweet engagements (e.g., Retweets, replies and likes), website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views.

 • Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as “promoted,” provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. Our Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising that is priced through an auction.

 • Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis.

While the majority of the Promoted Products we sell to our advertisers are placed on Twitter, we also generate advertising revenue by placing advertising products that we sell to advertisers on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings.

58

Data Licensing and Other

We generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data products and data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services through our MoPub exchange. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period. We recognize data licensing revenue as our data partners consume and benefit from their continuous use of the licensed data over time. In addition, we operate a mobile ad exchange and receive service fees from transactions completed on the exchange. Our mobile ad exchange enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell advertising inventory and matches buyers and sellers. We have determined we are not the principal as it relates to our performance obligation of providing an ad exchange service in the purchase and sale of advertising inventory in transactions between third-party buyers and sellers on the exchange. Therefore we report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis.

Total revenue $ 3,042,359 $ 2,443,299 $ 2,529,619 25 % (3 )%

2018 Compared to 2017. Revenue in 2018 increased by $599.1 million compared to 2017.

In 2018, advertising revenue increased by 24% compared to 2017. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products on our owned and operated platform in 2018 was $2.46 billion as compared to $1.90 billion in 2017. Advertising revenue generated from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2018 was $154.4 million as compared to $211.2 million in 2017.

The overall increase in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 55% increase in the number of ad engagements offset by a 20% decrease in cost per ad engagement in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in ad engagements was driven by increased demand and improved clickthrough rates. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects the ongoing mix shift to video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats), higher clickthrough rates, and a slight compression in like for like pricing.

The decrease in advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2018 was driven primarily by the lack of contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017). TellApart revenue contributed $44.6 million in revenue in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, and was fully deprecated in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Advertising revenue continued to be driven by continued sales momentum with advertisers, built around our differentiated ad formats, better relevance, and improved ROI. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows.

In 2018, data licensing and other revenue increased by 27% compared to 2017. A majority of the increase was attributable to expanded and new partnerships.

Looking ahead, while data licensing and other revenue continues to benefit from customers developing new use cases and smaller customers adopting self-service APIs, we are now largely through our multi-year enterprise renewal cycle. As a result, with many of our largest partners now at market pricing, revenue growth is likely to moderate in 2019.

59

2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 decreased by $86.3 million compared to 2016.

In 2017, advertising revenue decreased by 6% compared to 2016. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue was generated from our owned and operated platform. Advertising from the sale of our advertising products placed on third-party publishers’ websites, applications and other offerings in 2017 was driven by significantly lower contribution from TellApart (which was deprecated in 2017), which was offset by strong performance from Twitter Audience Platform. TellApart revenue was $44.6 million in 2017, mainly in the first half of 2017, compared to $126.4 million in 2016.

The overall decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to a 52% decrease in cost per ad engagement offset by a 96% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in cost per ad engagement reflects a higher mix of video ad engagements (which have overall lower cost per ad engagement compared to other ad formats) and lower cost per ad engagement across the majority of ad formats compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in ad engagements was driven by a continuing mix shift toward video ad impressions as well as higher clickthrough rates.

Advertising revenue continued to be driven by strong growth in our video ad formats offset by declines in traditional Promoted Tweet and direct response ad formats.

In 2017, data licensing and other revenue increased by 18% compared to 2016. A majority of the increase was attributable to growth in data licensing fees from the offering of data products.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes infrastructure costs, other direct costs including content costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of capitalized labor costs for internally developed software, allocated facilities costs, as well as traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. Infrastructure costs consist primarily of data center costs related to our co-located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs; as well as depreciation of servers and networking equipment; and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. TAC consists of costs we incur with third parties in connection with the sale to advertisers of our advertising products that we place on third-party publishers’ websites, applications or other offerings collectively resulting from acquisitions, and from our organically-built advertising network, Twitter Audience Platform. Certain of the elements of our cost of revenue are fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, cost of revenue increased by $103.8 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to an $89.3 million increase in direct costs, primarily driven by an increase in content costs and a $50.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.  These increases were offset by a $35.3 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the lack of advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $0.6 million decrease in other expenses.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, cost of revenue decreased by $71.0 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $48.6 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $45.3 million decrease in infrastructure costs, a $42.7 million decrease in TAC substantially due to the decrease in advertising revenue generated from TellApart (which we deprecated in 2017), and a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related costs. These decreases were offset by a $55.5 million increase in other direct costs that is primarily driven by an increase in content costs, and a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to additional internally developed software, server and networking equipment.

60

We plan to continue to scale the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, research and development expenses increased by $11.8 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $15.4 million net increase in allocated facilities costs, other supporting overhead expenses, and other expenses, and the absence of a $12.1 million one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were offset by a $8.7 million net decrease in personnel-related costs driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due partially to forfeitures offset in part by an increase in average employee headcount, and a $7.0 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, research and development expenses decreased by $171.5 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $141.6 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $25.9 million decrease in restructuring charges net of a one-time nonrecurring gain on sale of assets in 2017, a $23.7 million decrease in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to a decrease in overall total expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in other expenses, and a $2.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a $24.8 million decrease in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use.

We plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business to ensure that we have the right level of engineering, product management and design personnel and related resources to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include advertising costs, market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities costs, and other supporting overhead costs.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, sales and marketing expenses increased by $53.9 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $36.2 million net increase in allocated facilities costs and other supporting overhead expenses, a $9.3 million increase in marketing and sales-related expenses, and a $23.9 million net increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $240.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $116.0 million decrease in personnel-related costs, driven by a decrease in average employee headcount mainly as a result of our 2016 restructuring plan, a million decrease in restructuring expenses, and a $15.0 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets.

We continue to evaluate key areas in our business to ensure we have the right level of sales and marketing to execute on our key priorities and objectives. We expect that sales and marketing costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts and vary as a percentage of revenue.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information and accounting services and facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments.

2018 Compared to 2017. In 2018, general and administrative expense increased by $14.9 million compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to a $24.6 million net increase in personnel-related costs driven by an increase in average employee headcount offset in part by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, and a $7.9 million increase in professional service fees. These increases were offset by a $17.6 million decrease in allocated facilities costs, other supporting overhead expenses, and other expenses.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, general and administrative expense decreased by $9.4 million compared to 2016. The decrease was attributable to a $9.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs, mainly driven million increase in fees and costs for professional services, and a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.

We plan to continue to invest in key areas of our business and ensure that we have the right revenue.

2017 Compared to 2016. In 2017, other expense, net, was $73.3 million compared to other income, net, of $2.1 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the recording of an impairment charge financial instruments.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 decreased by $3.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in the income tax benefit arising from intraperiod allocation and partial release of valuation allowance attributable to the Tax Act related to alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits.

We anticipate that going forward we will have income tax expense, which amounts could be affected by our jurisdictional mix of profit before taxes, the extent foreign earnings are taxed in the United States through new remaining valuation allowances.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.

Revenue Recognition

We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services with the balance from data licensing and other arrangements.

We generate our advertising revenue primarily from the sale of our Promoted Products: (i) Promoted Tweets, (ii) Promoted Accounts and (iii) Promoted Trends. Promoted services may be sold in combination as a bundled arrangement or separately on a stand-alone basis.

69

For our Promoted Product arrangements, significant judgments are (i) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (ii) determining the basis for allocating contract consideration to performance obligations, (iii) determining whether we are the principal or the agent in arrangements where another party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, and (iv) estimating the transaction price to be allocated for contracts with tiered rebate provisions.

We may generate revenue from the on a gross basis and record the related third-party content monetization fees as cost of revenue.

We also generate advertising revenue by selling services in which we place ads on third-party publishers’ 

Fees for the advertising services above are recognized in the period when advertising is delivered as evidenced by a user engaging with a Promoted Tweet or an ad on a third-party publisher website or obtaining new followers, or video views, following a Promoted Account, delivery of impressions, or through the display of a Promoted Trend on our platform.

We have concluded that our data licensing arrangements, which we provide data as the customer consumes and benefits from the continuous data available on an ongoing basis. In arrangements with at least two performance obligations, we allocate revenue on a relative basis between the performance obligations based on standalone selling price (“SSP”) and recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

In other data licensing arrangements, we charge customers based on the amount of sales they generate from downstream customers using Twitter data. Certain of those royalty-based data licensing arrangements are subject to minimum guarantees. occur, and such amounts have been immaterial to date.

For data licensing arrangements involving two or more performance obligations, we use directly observable standalone transactions to determine SSP of Historical IP.  We use standalone transactions and consider all other reasonably available observable evidence to estimate SSP of Future IP.

Other revenue is primarily generated from service fees from We report revenue related to our ad exchange services on a net basis for the fees paid by buyers, net of costs related to acquiring the advertising inventory paid to sellers.

70

Arrangements involving order to allocate any potential discount to all performance obligations in the arrangement. The estimate of standalone selling price for pay-for-performance auction based products is determined based of the transaction and the allocation principle included in Topic 606. We have elected to exclude certain sales and indirect taxes from the determination of the transaction price.

Income Taxes

 We are including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.

We record a provision (benefit) for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.

We recognize tax benefits from of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. We record interest and penalties related to our uncertain tax positions in our provision (benefit) for income taxes.

The Tax Act contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities the expense is incurred and apply the approach of tax law ordering for reflecting the realization of loss carryforward expected to offset future GILTI.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.

71

We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2018. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management']:
(2) On April 17, 2018, our Board authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase program which commenced in July 2018. The program was temporarily paused in November 2018 following the completion of the BlueLine acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. We intend to complete the program in 2019.
