Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company Overview

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s vision is to be the most admired global agribusiness and nutrition company while creating value and growing responsibly. The Company’s growth strategy is spread across its five key growth platforms: Taste, Nutrition, Animal Nutrition, Health and Wellness, and Carbohydrates. The Company desires to execute this vision and these strategies by conducting its business in accordance with its core values of operating with integrity, treating others with respect, achieving excellence, being resourceful, displaying teamwork, and being responsible.

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in more than 170 countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company also engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of specialty products including natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients. The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Origination, Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in its operating structure. The Company's new segments are Origination (formerly Agricultural Services), Oilseeds (formerly Oilseeds Processing), Carbohydrate Solutions (formerly Corn Processing), and Nutrition (formerly Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients). The European origination business previously reported in Oilseeds is now managed by leaders in Origination to better coordinate continental trading activities. Carbohydrate Solutions now includes the results of ADM Milling, which were previously reported in Origination. In addition, the Company also moved the segment reporting of its renewable chemicals business from Carbohydrate Solutions to Oilseeds effective July 1, 2018. Nutrition now includes the results of Animal Nutrition and certain product lines previously reported in Carbohydrate Solutions as well as certain product lines previously reported in Oilseeds.

Readiness will also support the execution of the Company's growth strategies across its five key growth platforms: Taste, Nutrition, Animal Nutrition, Health and Wellness, and Carbohydrates.

Operating Performance Indicators

The Company’s Origination and Oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company’s Carbohydrate Solutions operations and Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In 2018, markets were volatile amid escalating global trade tensions including the announcement of tariffs on Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans. In Origination, strong demand for feedstuffs in light of weather conditions in Northern Europe resulted in higher sales volumes and margins in destination markets, and strong basis positions across commodities resulted in higher margins. In Oilseeds, dry conditions in Argentina resulted in a smaller soybean crop, which combined with continued good global meal demand, resulted in strong global crushing margins and volumes. South American origination volumes and margins benefited from stronger farmer selling. Demand and margins for refined oil remained solid, and biodiesel margins improved. Excess global peanut supply resulted in weak peanut margins. In Carbohydrate Solutions, global demand and prices for starches and sweeteners remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable. U.S. ethanol industry production remained at high levels. Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer, margins continue to remain under pressure. Nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems and from strong demand for and favorable margin development in certain non-flavor food businesses.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 13% or $0.2 billion, to $1.8 billion. Segment operating profit increased 29% or $0.7 billion, to $3.3 billion. Included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of $89 million consisting of asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges and a net gain on sales of assets and businesses. Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of $134 million consisting of asset impairment and restructuring charges, a net gain on sales of assets and businesses, and corn hedge timing effects. Adjusted segment operating profit increased $0.7 billion to $3.4 billion due to an increase in sales prices and volumes of corn and meal, improved margins in Origination, Oilseeds, and Nutrition, and the benefits of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by lower ethanol margins. Corporate results were a net charge of $1.2 billion in the current year compared to $0.9 billion in the prior year. Corporate results in the current year included a pension settlement charge of $117 million, a $49 million charge related to a discontinued software project, restructuring charges of $24 million primarily related to the reorganization of IT services, and a credit of $18 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. Corporate results in the prior year also included $54 million of restructuring charges primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company's global workforce.

Income taxes of $245 million increased $238 million due to a higher effective tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 11.9% compared to 0.4% for 2017 due primarily to the low rate in 2017 that was impacted by favorable tax adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaling $379 million. The effective tax rate for the current year also included the final effects of the U.S. tax reform and the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018, along with certain favorable discrete tax items netting to a favorable $74 million.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in metric tons):

-------------- ------ ---- ------ ------ -- --

(In thousands) 2018 2017 Change
Oilseeds 36,308 34,733 5 %
Corn 22,343 22,700 (2 )%
Total 58,651 57,433 2 %

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to increasing global demand for oilseed products, particularly meal, and higher crushing volumes in North America due to the reduced soybean crop in Argentina. The overall decrease in corn is primarily related to decreased current year processing after the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and production issues in the Decatur, Illinois corn complex in 2018.

Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

----------------------------------------- ------ ------ ---- ------ ------ ------ ----- - - -----

(In millions) 2018 2017 Change
Origination
Merchandising and Handling $ 24,816 $ 23,915 $ 901

Total Other 381 387 (6 )
Total $ 64,341 $ 60,828 $ 3,513

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds and Origination, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues increased $3.5 billion or 6%, to $64.3 billion due principally to higher sales prices ($2.3 billion) and higher sales volumes ($1.2 billion). The increase in sales prices and volumes was due primarily to increases in corn and soybean meal. Origination revenues increased 4% to $25.1 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.1 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($1.2 billion). Oilseeds revenues increased 11% to $24.8 billion due to higher sales volumes ($2.0 billion) and higher sales prices ($0.4 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 1% to $10.3 billion due to lower sales prices ($0.2 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion). Nutrition revenues increased 8% to $3.8 billion due to higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion).

Cost of products sold increased $2.9 billion to $60.2 billion due principally to higher sales volumes and higher prices for commodities. Included in cost of products sold was a credit of $18 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to $2 million in the prior year. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion to $5.4 billion due principally to increased energy cost, railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense, and other individually insignificant increases in certain expense categories.

Foreign currency translation impacts increased both revenues and cost of products sold by $0.4 billion.

30

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit increased $0.7 billion or 19%, to $4.2 billion. Higher results in Crushing and Origination ($490 million), Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other ($99 million), Merchandising and Handling ($204 million), and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients ($76 million) were partially offset by lower results in Bioproducts ($103 million) and Other ($36 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a positive impact on gross profit of $18 million compared to $2 million in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 9% to $2.2 billion due principally to higher performance-related compensation accruals and increased pension and project-related expenses.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $2 million to $171 million. Current year charges consisted of $56 million of impairment of certain long-lived assets, a $12 million impairment of an equity investment, a $21 million impairment related to a long-term financing receivable, and $9 million of other individually insignificant impairment and restructuring charges (presented as specified items within segment operating profit), and a $49 million charge related to a discontinued software project, $18 million of restructuring charges related to the reorganization of IT services and $6 million of individually insignificant restructuring charges in Corporate. Prior year charges consisted of $63 million of asset impairments related to the reconfiguration of the Company's Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments related to the closure of a facility, and $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company's global workforce.

Interest expense increased $34 million to $364 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and higher borrowings.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $62 million to $518 million due to earnings from a new equity investment and higher earnings from the Company’s equity investments in CIP and Olenex, partially offset by lower earnings from other equity investments.

Other expense - net of $101 million increased $111 million from net income of $10 million. Current year expense included foreign exchange losses and a non-cash pension settlement charge of $117 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain U.S. salaried retirees under the Company's ADM Retirement Plan. These expenses were partially offset by gains on disposals of businesses, an equity investment, and individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, and other income. Prior year net income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the early redemption of the Company's $559 million notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Origination operating profit increased 35%. Merchandising and Handling was up significantly year-over-year. Global trade delivered strong results due to increased volumes, strong margins, and improved opportunities in the soybean and feedstuff value chain. North American grain was up due to improved margins and higher volumes. Transportation was up due primarily to higher freight rates.

Oilseeds operating profit increased 79%. Crushing and Origination results increased due to a strong global demand and margin environment. The reduced soybean crop in Argentina combined with continued good global meal demand resulted in strong crushing margins and volumes. South America saw strong origination volumes and improving margins as farmer selling accelerated. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results were higher mainly due to the 2017 biodiesel tax credit of approximately $120 million which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018, solid biodiesel results, and higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Olenex, partially offset by weaker peanut shelling margins primarily caused by large peanut inventories and difficult market conditions. Asia results increased due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit decreased 12%. Starches and Sweeteners results decreased due to lower margins and volumes in liquid sweeteners mainly due to production issues in the Decatur, Illinois corn complex partially offset by improved results from starches and dry sweeteners. Bioproducts results were down as near record industry fuel ethanol inventories pressured margins and production issues in the Decatur, IL corn complex increased costs, partially offset by effective ethanol risk management.

Nutrition operating profit increased 9%. Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients results were up due to improved earnings across the segment and higher sales volumes related to contributions from new acquisitions and organic growth. In Wild Flavors, an improved portfolio mix boosted sales and margins. Health and Wellness improved driven largely by increased contributions from bioactives. Specialty Ingredients was up due to improved volumes and margins in proteins and increased sales in fibers partially offset by lower results in polyols. Animal Nutrition was down due to operational issues in Decatur, IL that constrained lysine production volumes and increased manufacturing costs partially offset by improved premix and commercial feed margins.

Other operating profit increased 14% primarily due to stronger results from its futures commission brokerage business due to higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower underwriting results from the Company’s captive insurance operations during the first half of 2018.

Corporate results are as follows:

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corporate results were a net charge of $1.2 billion in the current year compared to $0.9 billion in the prior year. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $18 million in the current year compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. Interest expense - net increased $11 million due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and higher borrowings, partially offset by interest income related to a tax credit and lower-tax related expense. Unallocated corporate costs increased $190 million due principally to higher performance-related compensation accruals, increased pension and project-related expenses, and railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense. Acquisition-related expenses in the current year related to expenses and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge certain acquisitions. Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior period related to the early redemption of the $559 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% notes due on March 15, 2018. Impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in the current year included a pension settlement charge of $117 million, a $49 million charge related to a discontinued software project, and restructuring charges of $24 million primarily related to the reorganization of IT services compared to restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce of $54 million in the prior year. Other charges decreased $32 million primarily due to improved results in the Company’s investment in CIP and lower non-service cost related pension expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In Origination, U.S. export competitiveness was strong during the first half of 2017 but weakened during the second half due to the large crops in South America. Overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global market. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable. Ethanol continues to face a challenging environment. Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer, U.S. industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins. Global oilseeds processing volumes remained strong, but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of Argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured margins. Slow selling by farmers in Brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes. While demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. biodiesel tax credit has negatively impacted biodiesel margins. Nutrition benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, but continued to be adversely affected by start-up costs and margin pressure in certain non-flavor food ingredient markets.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion. Segment operating profit decreased $0.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Included in segment operating profit in 2017 was a net charge of $134 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses, impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges, and corn hedge timing effects. Included in segment operating profit in 2016 was income of $81 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses/revaluation, impairment and restructuring charges, and corn hedge timing effects. Adjusted segment operating profit increased $47 million to $2.7 billion due to solid results in Carbohydrate Solutions, partially offset by weaker South American origination margins, lower soybean crush margins, and weaker results in some specialty ingredients. Corporate results were a net charge of $927 million in 2017 compared to $882 million in 2016. Corporate results in 2017 included a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016.

Income taxes decreased $527 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 0.4% compared to 29.3% for 2016 due primarily to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 29.3% to approximately 24.0% due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items, including the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the expiration of U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel credit, at the end of 2016 (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in metric tons):

-------------- ------ ---- ------ ------ - -

(In thousands) 2017 2016 Change
Oilseeds 34,733 33,788 3 %
Corn 22,700 22,273 2 %
Total 57,433 56,061 2 %

The Company and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil. The overall increase in corn is due to the strong demand environment for ethanol, partially offset by the production disruption in one of the Company’s plants due to a water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex.

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly to gross profit.

Revenues decreased $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $60.8 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.4 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion). The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to a decrease in volumes of unprocessed commodities, in particular volumes of soybeans, corn, rapeseed, and wheat. Origination revenues decreased 6% to $24.1 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.5 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion). Oilseeds revenues increased 2% to $22.4 billion due to higher sales volumes ($0.4 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 3% to $10.4 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.3 billion). Nutrition revenues of $3.5 billion were comparable to 2016.

Cost of products sold decreased $1.4 billion to $57.3 billion due principally to lower sales volumes. Included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.1 billion to $5.2 billion due to increased expenses for energy, operating and maintenance supplies, and contracted labor, and higher salaries and benefits.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit decreased $0.1 billion or 3%, to $3.5 billion. Lower results in soybean processing ($159 million) and grain origination ($86 million) were partially offset by higher results in canola processing ($41 million), sweeteners and starches ($44 million), and animal nutrition ($39 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 40. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $2 million positive impact on gross profit compared to a negative impact of $19 million in 2016.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to 2016. Expenses in 2017 included increased salaries and benefits cost related to further investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives. Expenses in 2016 included expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $118 million to $173 million. Charges in 2017 consisted of $63 million of asset impairments related to the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments primarily related to the closure of a facility, $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce. Charges in 2016 included $32 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $6 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges in Corporate.

Interest expense increased $37 million to $330 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of the $1 billion fixed-rate notes in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017. Interest expense in 2016 also included a credit of $8 million for the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $164 million to $456 million primarily due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar and improved results from the Company’s equity investment in CIP, partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings resulting from the disposal of an equity investment.

Other income - net decreased $110 million to $37 million. Income in 2016 included realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company's equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, recovery of loss provisions and gain related to the sale of the Company's Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets. Income in 2017 included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the full redemption of the Company's $559 million notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Origination operating profit increased 12%. Merchandising and Handling operating results increased due to improved Global Trade execution and strong destination marketing volume growth. Merchandising and Handling results also included a gain related to a confidential legal settlement, and a $42 million net recovery of property damage costs and business interruption losses related to the Company's New Orleans, Louisiana export facility. Transportation results decreased due to river conditions and lower barge freight volumes and margins.

Oilseeds operating profit decreased 3%. Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased from the prior year. Higher softseed results in North America and Europe were more than offset by weaker soybean crush margins due to ample supply of alternative proteins competing with soybean meal. In addition, improved South American soybean crushing results were more than offset by weak grain origination margins throughout the year. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit declined due to weaker biodiesel and specialty oils margins partially offset by higher results in South American packaged oils and the global peanut business. Asia results increased on higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar due to the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit increased 8%. Starches and Sweeteners operating profit increased due to improved domestic demand and higher volumes and margins from the international business. Bioproducts profit increased due to higher trading results partially offset by slightly lower ethanol margins.

Nutrition operating profit increased 14%. Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients operating profit increased due the continuing strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems across all regions, partially offset by lower results in specialty ingredients due in part to operational start-up costs. Animal Nutrition operating profit increased due to improved lysine margins partially offset by lower volumes caused by a mild winter.

Other operating profit decreased 62% primarily due to losses from the Company's captive insurance operations and lower results from its futures commission brokerage business. Results in 2017 included settlement of insurance claims from the Company's Origination segment totaling $50 million related to the New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corporate results were a net charge of $927 million in 2017 compared to $882 million in 2016. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $2 million in 2017 compared to a charge of $19 million in 2016. Interest expense - net increased $28 million due principally to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of $1 billion fixed-rate debt in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax return, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017 and the absence of the original Harvest Innovation adjustment of buy-out liability in May 2016. Unallocated corporate costs increased $13 million due principally to increased investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives partially offset by the absence of the railroad maintenance expense in 2016. Loss on debt extinguishment related to the early redemption of the Company’s $559 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% notes due on March 15, 2018. Asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in 2017 related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce compared to charges in 2016 which consisted of legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges. Post-retirement benefit adjustment related to the U.S. retiree medical benefit curtailment gain. Loss on sale of asset related to the sale of an investment, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment. Other charges increased $12 million due principally to lower results from the Company's equity investment in CIP.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Company’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash used in operating activities was $4.8 billion for 2018 compared to $6.0 billion in 2017. Working capital changes, including the increase in deferred consideration, decreased cash by $7.5 billion in the current year compared to $7.9 billion in the prior year. Trade receivables increased $0.4 billion due to higher revenues. Inventories decreased $0.2 billion due to lower inventory quantities.

Increase in deferred consideration in securitized receivables of $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, was offset by the same amount of net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables, which were previously classified as operating activities in the prior year, that are now classified as investing activities in accordance with the amended guidance of Topic 230.

Cash provided by investing activities was $6.6 billion this year compared to $7.3 billion last year. Capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired were $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, this year compared to $1.0 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively last year. Proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of $0.2 billion in the current year were comparable to the prior year. There were immaterial marketable securities sales transactions this year compared to sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $0.4 billion in the prior year. Investments in and advances to affiliates of $0.2 billion in the current year related to the joint venture with Cargill and investment in Aston Foods compared to $0.3 billion of additional investment in Wilmar in the prior year. Net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables was $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 billion this year compared to a use of $1.0 billion last year. Long-term debt borrowings in the current year consisted of the €650 million ($744 million as of December 31, 2018) aggregate principal amount of 1.0% Notes issued on September 12, 2018 and the December 3, 2018 issuance of $600 million and $400 million aggregate principal amounts of 4.5% and 3.375% Notes, respectively. Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year related to the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes issued on September 14, 2017. Long-term debt payments in the current year were $30 million compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year which primarily related to the full redemption of the $559 million notes due in 2018 and the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017. The Company issued debt in the current year for general corporate expenses and to pay down commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper payments in the current year were $0.7 billion compared to borrowings of $0.7 billion in the prior year. Share repurchases in the current year were $0.1 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year.

At December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.7 to 1.  Included in working capital is $5.6 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2018, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $19.0 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $10.4 billion, of which $8.9 billion was unused.  The Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 29% at December 31, 2018 and 27% at December 31, 2017.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 25% at December 31, 2018 and 27% at December 31, 2017.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the combined U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.4 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $5.2 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.

43

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.8 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2018, the Company utilized $1.5 billion of its facility under the Programs. The Programs are due to terminate during the first half of 2019. However, the Company currently expects to extend these Programs upon termination.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019. The Company has acquired approximately 87.9 million shares under this program as of December 31, 2018.

The Company expects capital expenditures of $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion during 2019. In 2019, the Company expects additional cash outlays of approximately $0.8 billion in dividends.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2018.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Neovia, a French-based global provider of value-added animal nutrition solutions, with 72 production facilities and a presence in 25 countries, for $1.8 billion (€1.5 billion). The Company funded the transaction using operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $107 million as of December 31, 2018 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

Interest expense increased $37 million to $330 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of the $1 billion fixed-rate notes in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017. Interest expense in 2016 also included a credit of $8 million for the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $164 million to $456 million primarily due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar and improved results from the Company’s equity investment in CIP, partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings resulting from the disposal of an equity investment.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performan...

Income taxes of $245 million increased $238 million due to a higher effective tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 11.9% compared to 0.4% for 2017 due primarily to the low rate in 2017 that was impacted by favorable tax adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaling $379 million. The effective tax rate for the current year also included the final effects of the U.S. tax reform and the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018, along with certain favorable discrete tax items netting to a favorable $74 million.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in metric tons):

-------------- ------ ---- ------ ------ -- --

(In thousands) 2018 2017 Change
Oilseeds 36,308 34,733 5 %
Corn 22,343 22,700 (2 )%
Total 58,651 57,433 2 %

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to increasing global demand for oilseed products, particularly meal, and higher crushing volumes in North America due to the reduced soybean crop in Argentina. The overall decrease in corn is primarily related to decreased current year processing after the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and production issues in the Decatur, Illinois corn complex in 2018.

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds and Origination, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues increased $3.5 billion or 6%, to $64.3 billion due principally to higher sales prices ($2.3 billion) and higher sales volumes ($1.2 billion). The increase in sales prices and due to lower sales prices ($0.2 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion). Nutrition revenues increased 8% to $3.8 billion due to higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion).

Cost of products increased energy cost, railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense, and other individually insignificant increases in certain expense categories.

Foreign currency translation impacts increased both revenues and cost of products sold by $0.4 billion.
