Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations and Commitments” of this Form 10-K.

 Guarantees and Indemnifications

			We provide guarantees, indemnifications, and other assurances to third parties in the normal course of our business. These include tort indemnifications, environmental assurances, and representations and warranties in commercial agreements. At May 26, 2019, we were not aware of any material liabilities arising from any guarantee, indemnification, or financial assurance we have provided. If the fair value of such liability becomes material, we will accrue for it at that time.

			Lamb Weston is a party to various potato purchase supply agreements with partner growers, under which they deliver their potato crop from the contracted acres to Lamb Weston during the harvest season, and pursuant to the potato supply agreements, pricing for this inventory is determined after delivery, taking into account crop size and quality, among other factors. Lamb Weston paid $152.0 million, $132.8 million, and $150.8 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, under the terms of the potato supply agreements. Amounts paid are initially recorded in inventory and charged to cost of sales as related inventories are produced and subsequently sold. Under the terms of these potato supply agreements, Lamb Weston has guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 26, 2019, Lamb Weston has effectively guaranteed $26.4 million of supplier loans. Lamb Weston has not established a liability for these guarantees, as Lamb Weston has determined that the likelihood of Lamb Weston’s required performance under the guarantees is remote. Under certain other potato supply agreements, Lamb Weston makes advances to growers prior to the delivery of potatoes. The aggregate amounts of these advances were $36.5 million and $24.6 million at May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively.

			Lamb Weston and Lamb Weston’s partner are jointly and severally liable for all legal liabilities of Lamb-Weston/Meijer. See Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, for further information on Lamb-Weston/Meijer’s liabilities and capital structure.

			After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters would not have a material adverse effect on Lamb Weston’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. It is reasonably possible that a change to an estimate of the foregoing matters may occur in the future.

 Legal Proceedings

			We are a party to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions include commercial liability claims, premises liability claims, and employment-related claims, among others. As of the date of this filing, we do not believe that any of the legal actions against us would, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Costs of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized in earnings as services are provided.

May 26, 2019
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation Basis of Presentation These Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements present the financial results of Lamb Weston for the fiscal years ended May 26, 2019, May 27, 2018, and May 28, 2017 (“fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017”), and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The fiscal year end of Lamb Weston ends the last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements presented consist of 52-week periods for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. The financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. The preparation of financial statements involves the use of estimates and accruals. Actual results may vary from those estimates. In addition, the financial statements for periods prior to the Separation may not reflect what our results of operations would have been had we operated as a separate stand-alone company and may not be indicative of our future results of operations. Our combined and consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lamb Weston and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary are included in our combined and consolidated financial statements from the date such determination was made. Intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the prior period combined and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Prior to Separation Prior to the Separation from Conagra on November 9, 2016 (the “Separation Date”), the combined financial statements were prepared using the specific accounting records of the entities which comprised the business of Lamb Weston. In some cases, principally foreign locations, those business activities were contained within entities that were engaged in other business activities of Conagra. Because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among the various units comprising Lamb Weston, Conagra and its subsidiaries’ equity investment is shown in lieu of stockholders’ equity in the combined financial statements. Intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions between the various legal entities comprising Lamb Weston have been eliminated in the combined and consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Separation Date, Lamb Weston’s combined financial statements included accounts specifically attributed to Lamb Weston and a portion of Conagra’s shared corporate general and administrative expenses. These shared services included, but were not limited to legal, finance, internal audit, financial reporting, income tax accounting and advisory, insurance, information technology, treasury, and human resources functions. Shared corporate general and administrative expenses not specifically identifiable to Lamb Weston were allocated to Lamb Weston. The allocations were determined on a basis which we consider being reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided by Conagra. However, these allocations may not reflect the costs and expenses that Lamb Weston would have incurred as a stand-alone public company. A more detailed discussion of the relationship with Conagra, including a description of the costs which have been allocated to Lamb Weston and the methods of cost allocation, is included in Note 14, Related Party Transactions. As further described in Note 14, prior to the Separation Date, Lamb Weston engaged in various intercompany transactions with Conagra and its affiliates, including the sale and purchase of certain products, the procurement of certain materials and services, cash transfers related to Conagra’s centralized cash management process and expense allocations. Changes in parent companies’ equity investment arising from these cash transactions are presented as “Net transfers to Conagra” in financing activities in the fiscal 2017 Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, notwithstanding that advances from parent companies were utilized to fund Lamb Weston’s working capital requirements.
Use of Estimates Use of Estimates The preparation of the combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to provisions for income taxes, estimates of sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, and the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
Revenue Recognition Revenue Recognition In May 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related amendments, collectively known as Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 (the “new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method. See Note 2, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for more information.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs, such as freight to our customers’ destinations, are considered fulfillment activities and are included in “Cost of sales” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When shipping and handling costs are included in the sales price charged for our products, they are recognized in “Net sales.”
Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Sales promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, and volume-based incentives. The estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and coupon utilization and redemption rates, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. The costs of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates made at the time of shipment or coupon release. The estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators. Estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs, with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following: quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities, current and past trade-promotion spending patterns, the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category, and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. The determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation, particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products. Final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event. Because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our estimates. As additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. At May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, we had $48.6 million and $45.4 million, respectively, of sales incentives and trade promotions payable recorded in “Accrued liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Advertising and Promotion Advertising and Promotion Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $32.4 million, $31.6 million, and $22.6 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Research and Development Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $15.4 million, $13.5 million, and $10.6 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense resulting from all stock-based compensation transactions are measured and recorded in the combined and consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Compensation expense is recognized over the period the employee provides service in exchange for the award. See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, for additional information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Book overdraft balances, if any, are classified in “Accounts payable” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable in our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as they do not represent bank overdrafts. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.2 million and $55.6 million at May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively.
Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect based on our past experience, as well as reliance on the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which was enacted to help promote fair trade in the fruit and vegetable industry by establishing a code of fair business practices. The collectability of our accounts receivable is based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to the Company to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount that we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized based on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates, the estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced. We periodically review our allowance for doubtful accounts and adjustments to the valuation allowance are recorded as income or expense. Trade accounts receivable balances that remain outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. At May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Inventories Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. The components of inventories were as follows (dollars in millions):
 May 26, May 27,
 2019 2018
Raw materials and packaging $ 93.1 $ 87.2
Finished goods 371.4 430.5
Supplies and other 33.8 32.0
Inventories (a) $ 498.3 $ 549.7

 (a) See Note 2, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for more information on the impact the adoption of the new revenue standard had on inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

 Property, Plant and Equipment

			Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditures for major improvements and replacements and the amount of interest cost associated with significant capital additions. The amount of interest capitalized from construction in progress was $7.6 million, $4.2 million, and $5.2 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The components of property, plant and equipment were as follows (dollars in millions):

------------------------------------------------ ------- --------- ------- - ---------
 May 26, May 27,
 2019 2018
Land and land improvements $ 142.2 $ 139.8
Buildings, machinery, and equipment 2,542.3 2,212.6
Furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and other 105.2 101.0
Construction in progress 84.8 127.9
Property, plant and equipment, at cost 2,874.5 2,581.3
Less accumulated depreciation (1,276.7) (1,160.5)
Property, plant and equipment, net $ 1,597.8 $ 1,420.8

 Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:

------------------------------------------------ -----------
Land improvements 1-40 years
Buildings 10-40 years
Machinery and equipment 5-20 years
Furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and other 3-15 years

			We recorded $155.5 million, $136.3 million, and $104.3 million of depreciation expense in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. At May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, purchases of property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable were $27.1 million and $27.9 million, respectively.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment

 Long-Lived Asset Impairment

 We review long-lived assets for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

 Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

			We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The reporting unit’s carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, and debt.

			During the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we performed a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment test, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying value of our Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other segments.

			We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful life. We perform a review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for our products lines.

			See Note 6, Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets, for additional information.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

 Fair Values of Financial Instruments

			Unless otherwise specified, Lamb Weston believes the carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value. See Note 12, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information.

Foreign Currency

 Foreign Currency

 Most of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs, and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of Consolidated Balance Sheets are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

			Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $3.3 million in fiscal 2019, a gain of $4.7 million in fiscal 2018, and a loss of $2.7 million in fiscal 2017. These amounts were recorded in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

 Derivative Financial Instruments

			We use derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our commodity risks. We do not hold or issue derivatives and other financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative instruments are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values, unless the derivative instruments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception (“NPNS”) under GAAP and such exception has been elected. If the NPNS exception is elected, the fair values of such contracts are not recognized. We do not designate commodity derivatives to achieve hedge accounting treatment. Derivative financial instruments did not have a material impact on our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings in any of the periods presented.

Income Taxes

 Income Taxes

			We recognize current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which we transact business. As part of the determination of our current tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken in the tax returns. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

			We also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences (e.g., the difference in book basis versus tax basis of fixed assets resulting from differing depreciation methods). If appropriate, we recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized, based on our assessment of estimated future taxable income, including the consideration of available tax planning strategies.

New and Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 New and Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 Accounting Standards Adopted

			In December 2018, SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, became effective, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant or outdated. The amendments include removing the requirement to disclose the historical and pro forma ratio of earnings to fixed charges and the related exhibit, as well as replacing the requirement to disclose the high and low trading prices of our common stock with a requirement to disclose the ticker symbol of our common stock. In addition, the amendments expanded the disclosure requirements for stockholders' equity for interim financial statements. Under the amendments, the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement. The final rule regarding stockholders’ equity was effective and implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and the other changes have been made to this Form 10-K.

			In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). This update provides guidance on when implementation costs may be capitalized as an asset related to service contracts and which costs should be expensed using the same model as if the cloud computing arrangement included a software license. The amendments in this update also require companies to expense capitalized implementation costs over the term of the hosting arrangement, including periods covered by renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. We adopted this standard in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

			Effective May 28, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments, collectively known as ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. See Note 2, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for more information.

			In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU requires employers to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and report it in the same line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. All other non-service components are required to be separate from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. These non-service components are not eligible for capitalization. Changes to the presentation of benefit costs are required to be adopted retrospectively, while changes to the capitalization of service costs into inventories are required to be adopted prospectively. We adopted the provisions of this guidance in fiscal 2019 (beginning May 28, 2018). The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits, for the amount of each component of net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs we reported historically.

 Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

			In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. This update amends ASC 715 to remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of disclosures, and adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU’s changes related to disclosures are part of the FASB’s disclosure framework project. This guidance is effective for our fiscal 2022 (beginning May 31, 2021) with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

			In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to reflect both the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months, whereas under current GAAP only capital lease liabilities (referred to as finance leases under ASC 842) are recognized on the balance sheet. ASC 842 also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We adopted the standard on May 27, 2019, the beginning of our 2020 fiscal year, using the optional adoption method provided in ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows us to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the period of adoption. As allowed, we will not adjust comparative period financial statements and disclosures for the impact of the new standard.

			We are in the final stages of determining the amount of the right of use assets and lease liabilities and the processes required to account for leasing activity on an ongoing basis. In connection with our adoption of the new lease standard, we will elect to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients, including the package of practical expedients under the transition guidance that permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions for lease identification and lease classification on expired or existing contracts and whether initial direct costs previously capitalized would qualify for capitalization under ASC 842. We will also elect the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components for all our leases and the expedient related to land easements, allowing us to not reassess our current accounting treatment for existing agreements on land easements, which are not accounted for as leases. We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases.

			At adoption, we expect to record a net increase to opening retained earnings of approximately $27 million to recognize the unamortized portion of a deferred gain previously recognized in connection with the sale of farmland that did not meet the accounting requirements for sale leaseback accounting (“Farmland Sale Leaseback”). At adoption, the Farmland Sale Leaseback qualifies as a sale under the new revenue standard. To account for the sale of the farmland, we expect to remove approximately $39 million and $66 million from “Property, plant and equipment, net” and “Long term debt, excluding current portion” from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, we expect to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability of approximately $160 million, including the lease for the farmland discussed above. For more information, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations.

 There were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Schedule of computation of basic and diluted earnings per common
 For the Fiscal Years Ended May
 2019 2018 2017
Numerator:
Net income attributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. $ 478.6 $ 416.8 $ 326.9
Less: Increase in redemption value of noncontrolling interests in excess of earnings allocated, net of tax benefits (a) 10.8 2.7 2.1
Net income available to Lamb Weston common stockholders $ 467.8 $ 414.1 $ 324.8

Denominator:
Basic weighted average common shares outstanding (b) 146.5 146.3 146.1
Add: Dilutive effect of employee incentive plans (c) 0.8 0.7 0.5
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 147.3 147.0 146.6

Earnings per share (a)
Basic $ 3.19 $ 2.83 $ 2.22
Diluted $ 3.18 $ 2.82 $ 2.22

 (a) Fiscal 2019 included accretion, net of tax benefits, of $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, which we recorded to increase the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the amount we paid to acquire the remaining 50.01% interest in Lamb Weston BSW. While the accretion, net of tax benefits, reduced net income available to Lamb Weston common stockholders and earnings per share, it did not impact net income in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Fiscal 2019 net income includes 100% of Lamb Weston BSW’s earnings beginning November 2, 2018, the date we entered into the definitive agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Lamb Weston BSW. See Note 7, Investments in Joint Ventures, for more information.

 (b) For the periods prior to the Separation, earnings per share was calculated based on approximately 146 million shares of Lamb Weston common stock that were distributed to Conagra stockholders on November 9, 2016.

 (c) Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and performance awards. As of May 26, 2019, an insignificant number of stock-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be antidilutive. As of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, we did not have any stock-based awards that were antidilutive.

Schedule of reconciliation of income tax expense using the statutory U.S. income tax rate compared with the actual income tax provision

			Income taxes computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rates to income from operations, including equity method earnings, and before income taxes are reconciled to the provision for income taxes set forth in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows (dollars in millions):

------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------ ----- ---- - ------ - ------
 For the Fiscal Years Ended May
 2019 2018 2017
Provision computed at U.S. statutory rate (a) $ 130.4 $ 162.6 $ 178.6
Increase (reduction) in rate resulting from:
State and local taxes, net of federal benefit 14.8 12.6 11.4

Total provision for taxes $ 133.6 $ 121.2 $ 170.2
Effective income tax rate (c) 21.5% 21.8% 33.3%

 (a) The U.S. statutory tax rate was 21% for fiscal 2019. Since our fiscal year-end is the last Sunday in May, the impact of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate from the Tax Act was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory tax rate of 29.3% for fiscal 2018. The U.S. statutory tax rate was 35% for fiscal 2017.

 (b) In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in fiscal 2018, we recorded a $45.4 million net provisional tax benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2018, including $5.5 million of deferred tax benefits originating during the year, with the new lower statutory tax rate. We also recorded an $11.5 million transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings that is primarily payable over eight years. In fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the one-time impacts of the Tax Act and reduced the transition tax by $2.4 million.

 (c) The effective income tax rate is calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings.

Less: Valuation allowance (b) (64.6) — (62.0) —
Net deferred taxes (c) $ 70.4 $ 194.3 $ 61.1 $ 152.8

 (a) At May 26, 2019, Lamb Weston has approximately $34.9 million of gross ($8.3 million after-tax) foreign net operating loss carryforwards, of which the majority expire by fiscal 2021. Lamb Weston also has approximately $100.0 million of gross ($7.0 million after-tax) state capital loss carryovers expiring in fiscal 2021.

 (b) The valuation allowance is predominantly related to non-amortizable intangibles and the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that we are not more likely than not to realize. The net impact on income tax expense related to changes in the valuation allowance, including net operating loss carryforwards, was $1.1 million of benefit in fiscal 2019 and zero in fiscal 2018.

 (c) Deferred tax assets of $1.8 million and $0.4 million, as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively, were presented in “Other assets.” Deferred tax liabilities of $125.7 million and $92.1 million, as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively, were presented in “Deferred income taxes” as a long-term liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred tax asset and liability net position is determined by tax jurisdiction.

Schedule of change in the unrecognized tax benefits

 The aggregate changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties consisted of the following (dollars in millions):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- - -----
 For the Fiscal Years Ended May
 2019 2018 2017
Beginning balance $ 13.2 $ 6.9 $ 3.8
Decreases from positions established during prior fiscal years (0.8) — —
Increases from positions established during current and prior fiscal years 10.4 7.9 2.2
Expiration of statute of limitations (1.1) (1.6) (0.9)
Adjustments resulting from the Separation — — 1.8
Ending balance (a) $ 21.7 $ 13.2 $ 6.9

 (a) If we were to prevail on the unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, it would result in a tax benefit of $18.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, and a reduction in the effective tax rate. The ending balances exclude $3.9 million and $2.9 million of gross interest and penalties in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.

 (a) Pension service costs are allocated to operations and reflected in “Cost of sales” and expected returns on pension assets and interest costs are reflected in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

			The decrease in fiscal 2019 net periodic pension cost, compared with fiscal 2018, reflects the amendment to the Lamb Weston, Inc. Pension Plan for Plant Hourly Employees, for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, so that no future benefits accrue after December 31, 2018.

 (b) Accumulated losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in our plans (which is between seven to eleven years for our pension plans and approximately four years for our post-retirement benefit plan), to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years. The estimated net amount of actuarial losses on pension and post-retirement benefits included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to be amortized in fiscal 2020 is a net loss of $0.7 million ($0.5 million after tax).

The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. While the underlying assets are actively traded on an exchange, the funds are not. There are currently no redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments on these investments. There are certain funds with thirty-day redeemable notice requirements.

 (b) Includes investments in exchange-traded funds based on quoted prices in active markets.

 (c) At May 27, 2018, the fair value of our plan assets was $17.3 million, which includes $12.0 million we contributed to the Plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, net of benefit payments. The fourth quarter contribution was invested in cash and cash equivalents at May 27, 2018, and invested per the target investment allocation policy after fiscal year-end. The remaining $5.5 million was invested per our investment policy. In connection with the fourth quarter contribution, we changed our investment policy to invest 30% in equities and 70% in fixed income securities. The asset portfolio was rebalanced in June 2018.

(7) Rialto Information about homebuilding activities in the Company's urban divisions which are not economically similar to other divisions in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not considered a reportable segment. All prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the Company's current presentation. Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation. The Company's reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina Central: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia Texas: Texas West: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington Other: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments, including FivePoint Operations of the Lennar Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Company's homes and others. It also includes a real estate brokerage business acquired as part of the WCI transaction, which was sold subsequent to November 30, 2018.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018. The following table discloses amounts related to Conrail. Purchase price amortization and equity earnings are included in equity earnings of affiliates and all other ...
