Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executing on our Strategy
We reported Net income attributable to common stockholders of $249.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $159.9 million, net of $80.7 million of merger costs, during the same period in 2017.
We sustained superior same property NOI growth:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We achieved pro-rata same property NOI growth, as adjusted, excluding termination fees, of 3.4%.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We executed 1,802 leasing transactions representing 6.2 million pro-rata SF of new and renewal leasing, with trailing twelve month rent spreads of 8.3% on comparable retail operating property spaces.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• At December 31, 2018, our total property portfolio was 95.6% leased, while our same property portfolio was 96.1% leased.

We developed and redeveloped high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We started three new developments representing a total pro-rata project investment of $80.5 million upon completion, with a weighted average projected return on investment of 7.1%.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We started eight new redevelopments representing a total pro-rata project investment of $112.2 million upon completion, with a weighted average projected return on investment of 8.3%.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Including these new projects, a total of 19 properties were in the process of development or redevelopment, representing a pro-rata investment upon completion of $389.9 million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We completed four new developments representing a total pro-rata project investment of $167.7 million, with a weighted average return on investment of 7.4%.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We completed twelve new redevelopments representing a total pro-rata project investment of $184.4 million, with a weighted average return on investment of 6.9%.

We maintained a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On March 9, 2018, the Company received proceeds from the sale of $300.0 million of 4.125% senior unsecured public notes, which priced at 99.837% and mature in March 2028. $60 million of the proceeds was used to repay our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Line”) and $163.2 million was used, in April, to early redeem our $150.0 million 6.0% senior unsecured public notes originally due June 2020, including accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date and a make-whole amount. We used the remainder of the proceeds to repay 2018 mortgage maturities and for general corporate purposes.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On March 26, 2018, we amended and restated our Line. The amendment and restatement increases the size of the Line to $1.25 billion from $1.0 billion and extends the maturity date to March 23, 2022, with options to extend maturity for two additional six-month periods. Borrowings will bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, subject to our credit ratings, compared to a rate of 92.5 basis points under the previous facility. An annual facility fee of 15 basis points, subject to our credit ratings, applies to the Line.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2018, we repurchased $246.5 million of our common stock at a weighted average price per share of $57.97.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• At December 31, 2018, our annualized net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio on a pro-rata basis was 5.3x.

Leasing Activity and Significant Tenants
We believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail tenants.
Pro-rata Occupancy
The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:

------------------------- ----------------- -----------------

 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
% Leased – All properties 95.6% 95.5%
Anchor space 98.4% 98.1%
Shop space 90.9% 91.1%

The decline in shop space percent leased is driven by strategic vacancies in preparation for redevelopments.
Pro-rata Leasing Activity
The following table summarizes leasing activity, including our pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our co-investment partnerships:

Total weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during 2018 was $33.45 PSF and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $30.62 PSF.
Significant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk
We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant. The following table summarizes our most significant tenants, based on their percentage of annualized base rent:

Bankruptcies and Credit Concerns
Our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring retail trends, consumer preferences, customer shopping behaviors, changes in retail delivery methods, and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting the retail industry. A greater shift to e-commerce, large-scale retail business failures, unemployment, and tight credit markets could negatively impact consumer spending and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification, re-tenanting weaker tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive foot traffic, and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas. As a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer in order to reduce our risk from bankruptcies and store closings.
We closely monitor the operating performance and rent collections of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those retailers experiencing significant changes to their business models as a result of reduced customer traffic in their stores and increased competition from e-commerce sales. Retailers who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures may file for bankruptcy. Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to release the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. Tenants who have filed for bankruptcy and continue to occupy space at December 31, 2018 in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.4% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis.

The $15.8 million net increase in total interest expense is due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $10.0 million net increase in interest on notes payable primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $7.6 million increase from the issuances of $950 million of new unsecured debt during 2017. The debt proceeds were used as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------
▪ $325 million used to redeem all of our preferred stock,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ $415 million used to fund consideration paid to Equity One to repay its credit facilities not assumed by the Company in the merger, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• further increased by $4.3 million in interest on unsecured credit facilities related to higher average balances primarily related to the Equity One merger and higher interest rates.

During 2018, we recognized $38.4 million of impairment losses, including $12.6 million of goodwill impairment, on ten operating properties and two land parcels, eight of which have been sold. Of the four remaining properties, three are included in Properties held for sale as of December 31, 2018. We did not recognize any impairments during 2017.
During 2018, we early redeemed $150 million of 6% senior unsecured notes resulting in $11.0 million of debt extinguishment costs. During 2017, we repaid nine mortgages with a portion of the proceeds from our unsecured public debt offering, and recognized $12.4 million of debt extinguishment costs.
Net investment income decreased $5.1 million, driven by valuation changes in the stock market, primarily attributable to investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

Total equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships $ 42,974 43,341 (367 )

The $367,000 decrease in total Equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is attributed to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $2.2 million increase within GRIR primarily due to an increase in minimum rent across the portfolio of properties and reduced depreciation;

• $2.3 million decrease within Columbia I due to our $2.4 million share of gains on the sale of real estate recognized in 2017;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $3.1 million increase within Columbia II due to our $3.1 million share of gains on the sale of real estate recognized in 2018; and

The $9.7 million income tax benefit during 2017 was due to revaluing the net deferred tax liability at a TRS entity acquired through the Equity One merger, as a result of the change in corporate tax rates from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
During 2017, we redeemed all of our outstanding preferred stock.

The $41.9 million net increase in total interest expense is due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• $38.0 million increase in interest on notes payable due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $26.0 million of additional interest on notes payable assumed with the Equity One merger; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $29.7 million increase in interest attributable to the issuance of $950 million of new unsecured debt in 2017. The debt proceeds were used as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------
▪ $325 million used to redeem all of our preferred stock,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ $415 million used to fund consideration paid to Equity One to repay its credit facilities not assumed by the Company in the merger, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ $210 million used to retire mortgage loans and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ offset by $6.9 million decrease in mortgage interest expense primarily due to the payoff of nine mortgages loans; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $10.8 million decrease due to the early redemption of our $300 million notes during 2016;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $9.0 million increase in interest on unsecured credit facilities related to higher average balances primarily related to the Equity One merger;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• offset by $4.5 million decrease from higher capitalization of interest based on the size and progress of development and redevelopment projects in process.

We did not recognize any impairments during 2017. During 2016, we recognized $4.2 million of impairment losses on two operating properties and two land parcels, all of which have since been sold.
During 2017, we sold six operating properties and nine land parcels resulting in gains of $27.4 million, compared to gains of $47.3 million from the sale of eleven operating properties and sixteen land parcels during 2016.
During 2017, we repaid nine mortgages with a portion of the proceeds from our unsecured public debt offering in June 2017, and recognized $12.4 million of debt extinguishment costs. In 2016, we recognized a $14.2 million charge in connection with the early redemption of the $300 million unsecured notes.
Net investment income increased $2.3 million, attributable primarily to realized and unrealized gains on investments held within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
During 2016, we recognized a $40.6 million charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017.

Total equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships $ 43,341 56,518 (13,177 )

The $13.2 million decrease in our total Equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $2.4 million decrease within GRIR driven by gains on sale of real estate that were recognized in 2016, offset by lower depreciation expense in 2017 related to assets that became fully depreciated in 2016;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $1.7 million decrease within Columbia II due to gains on sale of real estate that were recognized in 2016;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $3.3 million increase within USAA due to gains on sale of real estate recognized in 2017; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $13.0 million decrease within Other investments in real estate partnerships due to our pro-rata share of gains on sale of real estate recognized in these partnerships in 2016.

The following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders:

------------------------------------------------------------------- --- ------- ------- ---- ------- ------- --- ------ ------

Net income attributable to exchangeable operating partnership units 388 257 131
Net income attributable to common unit holders $ 160,337 144,117 16,220

The $9.7 million income tax benefit during 2017 was due to revaluing the net deferred tax liability at a taxable REIT subsidiary acquired through the Equity One merger, as a result of the change in corporate tax rates from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
During 2017, we redeemed both our Series 6 and Series 7 preferred stock, resulting in a decrease to preferred stock dividends, offset by a charge upon writing off issuance costs.

Supplemental Earnings Information
We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operating results. We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing the Company's operating results to other REITs. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. See "Defined Terms" in Part I, Item 1.
Pro-Rata Same Property NOI:
For purposes of evaluating same property NOI on a comparative basis, and in light of the merger with Equity One on March 1, 2017, we are presenting our same property NOI on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, as if the merger had occurred January 1, 2017. This perspective allows us to evaluate same property NOI growth over a comparable period. The pro forma same property NOI as adjusted is not necessarily indicative of what the actual same property NOI and growth would have been if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2017, nor does it purport to represent the same property NOI and growth for future periods.
Our pro-rata same property NOI as adjusted, excluding termination fees, changed as follows:

(1) Adjusted for Equity One operating results prior to the merger for this period. For additional information and details about the Equity One operating results included herein, refer to the Same Property NOI reconciliation at the end of the Supplemental Earnings section.

Base rent increased $28.4 million, driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and rent commencements.
Recoveries from tenants increased $22.2 million, as a result of increases in recoverable costs, as noted below.
Other income increased $3.8 million, due to an increase in parking income, land rental, temporary tenants.
Operating expenses increased $28.1 million, primarily due to a $17.6 million increase in real estate tax assessments and $8.8 million increase in common area maintenance costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
We use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility. We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity, to repay maturing debt, or fund our capital commitments.
Except for $500 million of unsecured public and private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor on the $500 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company. All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships. The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units. Based upon our available sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs.
In addition to our $42.5 million of unrestricted cash at December 31, 2018, the Company has the following additional sources of capital available:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ---------

(in thousands) December 31, 2018
ATM equity program (see note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)
Original offering amount $ 500,000
Available capacity $ 500,000

Line of Credit (the "Line") (see note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)
Total commitment amount $ 1,250,000
Available capacity (1) $ 1,095,612
Maturity (2) March 23, 2022

(1) Net of letters of credit.
(2) The Company has the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods.

Our dividend distribution policy is set by our Board of Directors, who monitors our financial position. Our Board of Directors recently declared a common stock dividend of $0.585 per share, payable on March 7, 2019, to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2019. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability. We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
We expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $610.3 million and $469.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We paid $376.8 million and $328.3 million to our common and preferred stock and unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We currently do not have any preferred shares or units issued and outstanding.
To meet our additional cash requirements beyond our dividend, we will utilize the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• remaining cash generated from operations after dividends paid,

- --------------------------------------
• proceeds from the sale of real estate,

- ---------------------------------------
• available borrowings from our Line, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new long-term debt.

 52

During the next twelve months, we estimate that we will require approximately $171.8 million of cash to fund the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• $143.7 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments,

- -----------------------------------------
• $13.2 million to repay maturing debt, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $14.9 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of maturing debt.

If we start new developments, redevelop additional shopping centers, commit to new acquisitions, prepay debt prior to maturity, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase. If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. In addition, we have a contractual commitment to purchase, through December 2019, up to an additional 90.6% ownership interest in an operating shopping center. We currently expect the seller to require us to purchase an additional 25.6% ownership interest in the property by December 2019 for approximately $27.5 million.
We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2018, 87.8% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the Line. Our annualized Fixed charge coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 4.2 and 4.1 times for the periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our Line, Term Loans, and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 and expect to remain in compliance.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $764,000 increase in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships; and,

Significant investing and divesting activities included:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We invested $85.3 million in 2018 to acquire three operating properties. Other than those included with the Equity One merger, we invested $124.7 million in 2017 to acquire two operating properties and two real estate parcels at existing operating properties.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We issued 65.5 million shares of common stock to the shareholders of Equity One valued at $4.5 billion in a stock for stock exchange and merged Equity One into the Company on March 1, 2017. As part of the merger, we paid $646.8 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, to repay credit facilities not assumed with the merger at the closing date.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We invested $120.7 million less in 2018 than 2017 on real estate development, redevelopment, and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We received proceeds of $250.4 million from the sale of ten shopping centers and nine land parcels in 2018, compared to $110.0 million for six shopping centers and nine land parcels in 2017.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We invested $74.2 million in our real estate partnerships during 2018, including:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $48.8 million to fund our share of acquiring four operating properties,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $1.3 million to acquire an interest in one land parcel for development,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $21.9 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities, and

- ------------------------------------------------
◦ $2.2 million to fund our share of maturing debt.

During the same period in 2017, we invested $23.5 million in our real estate partnerships, including:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $8.8 million to acquire an interest in one land parcel for development,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ $7.8 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities, and

- ------------------------------------------------
◦ $6.9 million to fund our share of maturing debt.

 54

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds. The $14.6 million received in 2018 is driven by the sale of one land parcel and one operating property plus our share of proceeds from financing activities at two operating properties. During the same period in 2017, we received $36.6 million from the sale of three operating properties and one land parcel plus our share of proceeds from refinancing certain operating properties within the partnerships.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to investments held in our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan.

We plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment purposes. During 2018, we deployed capital of $226.2 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties as comprised of the following:

------------------------------------------------- ------ ------- ---- ------- ------- ------- -------- -

(in thousands) 2018 2017 Change
Capital expenditures:
Land acquisitions for development / redevelopment $ 2,787 24,775 (21,988 )
Building and tenant improvements 68,463 54,200 14,263
Redevelopment costs 51,351 133,597 (82,246 )

Capitalized interest 6,303 7,946 (1,643 )
Capitalized direct compensation 10,487 16,738 (6,251 )
Real estate development and capital improvements $ 226,191 346,857 (120,666 )

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2018 we acquired three land parcels for new development and redevelopment projects as compared to four land parcels acquired during 2017.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Building and tenant improvements increased $14.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the overall increase in the size of our portfolio from the merger with Equity One in March 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Redevelopment expenditures were lower during 2018 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects currently in process. We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, facade renovations, new out-parcel building construction, and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs. The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Development expenditures were lower in 2018 due to the progress towards completion of our development projects currently in process. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had six and eight consolidated development projects, respectively, that were either under construction or in lease up. See the tables below for more details about our development projects.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended. We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties. We currently expect that our development activity will approximate our recent historical averages, although the amount of activity by type will vary and likely shift towards more redevelopment in the near future. Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project. Changes in the level of future development activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development projects that may be capitalized. A 10% reduction in development activity without a corresponding reduction in development related compensation costs could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.5 million per year.

Contractual Obligations
We have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities and interest rate swap obligations as described further below and in note 8, note 9, and note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center. We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we have a contractual commitment to purchase, through December 2019, up to an additional 90.6% ownership interest in an operating shopping center. We currently expect the seller to require us to purchase an additional 25.6% ownership interest in the property by December 2019 for approximately $27.5 million.
The following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of December 31, 2018, and excludes the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Recorded debt premiums or discounts and issuance costs that are not obligations;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Obligations related to construction or development contracts, since payments are only due upon satisfactory performance under the contracts;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Letters of credit of $9.4 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, which the latter will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Obligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.

 59

Critical Accounting Estimates
Knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period. These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.
Accounts Receivable and Straight Line Rent
Minimum rent, percentage rent, and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue. As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical tenant collection rates, write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.

 60

Real Estate Investments
Acquisition of Real Estate Investments
Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. If the acquisition is determined to be a business combination, any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill. Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized, while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred.
We strategically co-invest with partners to own, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop operating properties. We analyze our investments in real estate partnerships in order to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. The Company consolidates partnerships in which it owns less than 100%, but which it controls. Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs") and voting interest entities. For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Management uses its judgment when making these determinations. We use the equity method of accounting for investments in real estate partnerships when we have significant influence but do not have a controlling financial interest. Under the equity method, we record our investments in and advances to these entities as Investments in real estate partnerships in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the partnership is recognized in Equity in income (loss) of investments in real estate partnerships in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Development and Redevelopment of Real Estate Assets and Cost Capitalization
We have a development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties. We capitalize the acquisition of land, the construction of buildings, and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them in Real estate assets, at cost, in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other specifically identifiable development costs include pre-development costs essential to the development process, as well as, interest, real estate taxes, and direct employee costs incurred during the development period. Once a development property is substantially complete and held available for occupancy, these indirect costs are no longer capitalized.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pre-development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits, legal, engineering, and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center. If we determine it is probable that a specific project undergoing due diligence will not be developed, we immediately expense all related capitalized pre-development costs not considered recoverable.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest costs are capitalized to each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended. We cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we capitalized interest of $7.0 million, $7.9 million, and $3.5 million, respectively, on our development projects.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Real estate taxes are capitalized to each development project over the same period as we capitalize interest.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program. All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project. The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we capitalized $17.1 million, $17.6 million, and $13.0 million, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development program.

 61

Valuation of Real Estate Investments
In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable. If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value. Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance. In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.
We evaluate our investments in real estate partnerships for impairment whenever there are indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investments in real estate partnerships may be impaired. An investment in a real estate partnerships is considered impaired only if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment in that real estate partnerships on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors, such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include the age of the real estate partnerships, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, and the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than-temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate partnership, the carrying value of the investment will be adjusted to an amount that reflects the estimated fair value of the investment.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks. We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations. Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems. Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs. We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination. We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk. We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites. We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.
As of December 31, 2018 we and our Investments in real estate partnerships had accrued liabilities of $8.7 million for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation. We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed. Our unconsolidated investment partnership properties have been financed with non-recourse loans. We have no guarantees related to these loans.

Inflation/Deflation
Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the near future. Most all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, which require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines. Occupancy declines will result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017.

Strategy 2 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...

[Part I, Item 1]:
ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, India, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. In August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc.

The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The results of RB Foods' operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition. Business Segments We operate in two business segments, consumer and flavor solutions. Demand for flavor is growing globally, and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home, dining out, purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We o...
