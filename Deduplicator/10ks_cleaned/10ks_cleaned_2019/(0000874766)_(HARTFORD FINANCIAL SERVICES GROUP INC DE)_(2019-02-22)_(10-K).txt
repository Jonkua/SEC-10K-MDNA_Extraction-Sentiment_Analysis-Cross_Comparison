Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RATIOS
The Company considers the measures and ratios in the following discussion to be key performance indicators for its businesses. Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford’s businesses. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this MD&A. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s competitors.
Definitions of Non-GAAP and Other Measures and Ratios
Assets Under Management (“AUM”)- include mutual fund and exchange-traded products ("ETP") assets. AUM is a measure used by the Company's Hartford Funds segment because a significant portion of the Company’s mutual fund and ETP revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
Book Value per Diluted Share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI")- is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP ("GAAP") measure. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes it is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items in AOCI that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.
Current Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio- a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current accident year (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. A catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the Property Claim Service office of Verisk. The current accident year catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.

Combined Ratio- the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses.
Core Earnings- a non-GAAP measure, is an important measure of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the underlying performance of the Company’s businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, certain restructuring and other costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, pension settlements, integration and transaction costs in connection with an acquired business, gains and losses on reinsurance transactions, income tax benefit from a reduction in deferred income tax valuation allowance, impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform") on net deferred tax assets, and results of discontinued operations. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Company believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. Core earnings are net of preferred stock dividends declared since they are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding. Net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders and income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company’s business. Therefore, the Company believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and core earnings when reviewing the Company’s performance.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Includes income tax benefit on items not included in core earnings and other federal income tax benefits and charges, including an $877 charge in 2017 primarily due to a reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Core Earnings Margin- a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment’s operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing (a) core earnings by (b) revenues excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses) on revenues or obscured by the effect on net income of realized capital gains (losses), integration costs, and the impact of Tax Reform on net deferred tax assets. Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both net income margin and core earnings margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Group Benefits.
Expense Ratio- for the underwriting segments of Commercial Lines and Personal Lines is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and insurance operating costs and expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.
The expense ratio for Group Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. The expense ratio does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business.
Fee Income- is largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, the growth in assets

under management either through positive net flows or favorable market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. Conversely, either negative net flows or unfavorable market performance will reduce fee income.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.
The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio before Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development- a measure of the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development.

34

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Loss Ratio, excluding Buyouts- utilized for the Group Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Group Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.
Mutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Product Assets- are owned by the shareholders of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products and holds an investment in the fund for a period of time. Mutual fund and ETP assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company’s Hartford Funds segment revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
New Business Written Premium- represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. New business written premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium.
Policies in Force- represents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines and standard commercial lines within Commercial Lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.
Policy Count Retention- represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies available to renew. The number of policies available to renew represents the number of policies, net of any cancellations, written in the previous policy term. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.
Policyholder Dividend Ratio- the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.
Prior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.
Reinstatement Premiums- represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers.
Renewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)- Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines automobile business and

twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s Property and Casualty business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.
Renewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)- for Commercial Lines, represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed. For Personal Lines, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Lines, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate filed with and approved by state regulators during the period and the amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers’ compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.
Return on Assets (“ROA”), Core Earnings- a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment’s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses). ROA, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Hartford Funds.
Underlying Combined Ratio- a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes the underlying combined ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and

35

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. A reconciliation of combined ratio to underlying combined ratio is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Commercial Lines and Personal Lines.
Underwriting Gain (Loss)- The Company's management evaluates profitability of the P&C businesses primarily on the basis of underwriting gain (loss). Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, underwriting expenses, amortization of other intangible assets and dividends to policyholders. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of the Company's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the Company's pricing and underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of before tax profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company's investing activities. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to underwriting gain (loss) for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Property & Casualty Other Operations is set forth in segment sections of MD&A.
Written and Earned Premiums- Written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Earned premium is a U.S. GAAP and statutory measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium.
Traditional life and disability insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums, together with net investment income earned, are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, customer demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the Company’s reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of premium remaining in-force from year-to-year.

THE HARTFORD'S OPERATIONS
Overview
The Hartford conducts business principally in five reporting segments including Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The Company includes in the Corporate category investment management fees and expenses related to managing third party business, including management of the invested assets of Talcott Resolution, discontinued operations related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments. In addition, Corporate includes a 9.7% ownership interest in the legal entity that acquired the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.
The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) management fees on mutual fund and ETP assets; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force.
The profitability of the Company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments.
Similar to Property & Casualty, profitability of the Group Benefits business depends, in large part, on the ability to evaluate and price risks appropriately and make reliable estimates of mortality, morbidity, disability and longevity. To manage the pricing risk, Group Benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, declining interest rates and other factors. However, as policies are typically sold with rate guarantees of up to three years, pricing for the

36

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Company’s products could prove to be inadequate if loss and expense trends emerge adversely during the rate guarantee period. For some of its products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. New and renewal business for group benefits business, particularly for long-term disability, are priced using an assumption about expected investment yields over time. While the Company employs asset-liability duration matching strategies to mitigate risk and may use interest-rate sensitive derivatives to hedge its exposure in the Group Benefits investment portfolio, cash flow patterns related to the payment of benefits and claims are uncertain and actual investment yields could differ significantly from expected investment yields, affecting profitability of the business. In addition to appropriately evaluating and pricing risks, the profitability of the Group Benefits business depends on other factors, including the Company’s response to pricing decisions and other actions taken by competitors, its ability to offer voluntary products and self-service capabilities, the persistency of its sold business and its ability to manage its expenses which it seeks to achieve through economies of scale and operating efficiencies.
The financial results of the Company’s mutual fund and ETP businesses depend largely on the amount of assets under management and the level of fees charged based, in part, on asset share class and product type. Changes in assets under management are driven by two main factors, net flows and the market return of the funds, which are heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity and bond markets. Net flows are

comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and ETP stockholders. Financial results are highly correlated to the growth in assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis.
The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses are paid. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the Company’s invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations.
The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.
For further information on the Company's reporting segments, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business — Reporting Segments.

Financial Highlights

-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------

Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share Book Value per Diluted Share

Net Income (loss) available to common stockholders of $1,801, or $5.03 per basic share and $4.95 per diluted share, compared with prior year net loss of $3,131, or $8.61 per basic and diluted share. The change from net loss in 2017 to a net income in 2018 was primarily due to a number of charges in 2017, including a $3.3 billion loss on the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, net of tax, $877 of income tax expense primarily from reducing net deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the corporate Federal income tax rate, and the effect of a pension settlement charge of $488, net of tax. Apart from these charges in 2017, net income available to common stockholders increased, driven by higher net income in Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds that was partially attributable to a lower corporate Federal income tax rate in 2018.

37

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Book value per diluted common share decreased to $35.06 from $37.11 as of December 31, 2017 as a result of a 5% decrease in common stockholders' equity resulting primarily from a decrease in AOCI over the period, partially offset by net income in excess of stockholder dividends.

--------------------- --------------------------

Net Investment Income Investment Yield After Tax

Net investment income increased 11% to $1,780 compared with the prior year primarily due to higher average fixed maturities asset levels during 2018 as compared to 2017 largely driven by the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business in November 2017 and, to a lesser extent, higher income from partnerships and other alternative investments and a higher reinvestment rate on fixed maturities.
Net realized capital gains (losses) changed to net losses of $112 from net gains of $165 for the year ended December 31, 2017, with losses in 2018 primarily driven by net losses on sales of fixed maturity securities due to sector repositioning and duration, liquidity and credit management as well as net losses on equity securities resulting from depreciation in value due to lower equity market levels, partially offset by gains on sales due to tactical repositioning.
Annualized investment yield, after tax of 3.3%, was up 30 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the effect of a lower corporate Federal income tax rate.
Net unrealized gains, after tax for fixed maturities in the investment portfolio decreased by $2,180 compared with the prior year primarily due to the effect of credit spread widening and higher interest rates and the removal of AOCI related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.

-------------------- ------------------

P&C Written Premiums P&C Combined Ratio

Written premiums for Property & Casualty decreased 1.0% compared with the prior year, reflecting a decrease in Personal Lines, largely offset by an increase in Commercial Lines.

38

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Combined ratio for Property & Casualty decreased 2.2 points to 97.8 compared with a combined ratio of 100.0 for 2017 largely due to a lower current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for Personal Lines and favorable prior accident year development, partially offset by higher expenses.
Catastrophe losses of $821, before tax, decreased from catastrophe losses of $836, before tax, in the prior year, with catastrophes in both years including losses from California wildfires, hurricanes, winter storms and various wind and hail events.
Prior accident year development for property and casualty was a net favorable $167, before tax, in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in reserves for workers' compensation, automobile liability and 2017 catastrophes, partially offset by an increase in reserves for general liability. Reserve development was a net favorable $41, before tax, in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in reserves for workers compensation and package business, partially offset by a reserve increase for customs bond claims.

--------------------------------

Group Benefits Net Income Margin

Net income margin for Group Benefits declined from 7.2% in 2017 to 5.6% in 2018 primarily due to net realized capital losses of $39, net of tax, in 2018 as compared to net realized capital gains of $19, net of tax, in 2017, integration costs of $37, net of tax, in 2018 as compared to $11, net of tax, in 2017, and a tax benefit of $52 in 2017 from reducing net deferred tax liabilities due to the lower corporate income tax rate, partially offset by an increase in favorable prior incurral year development on long-term disability and premium waiver primarily due to favorable incidence trends and the effect of scale from the acquisition of Aetna’s U.S. group life and disability business on fixed expenses. Prior accident year development, pre-tax, for Group Benefits increased from $185 in 2017 to $324 in 2018 with most of that development from the 2017 incurral year as incidence trends become known after the elimination period is satisfied.

[1] Excludes distribution costs of $188 and $184 for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, that were previously netted against fee income and are now presented gross in insurance operating costs and other expenses.

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017
Net income (loss) available to common stockholders increased from a net loss in 2017, primarily due to a number of charges in 2017, including a $3.3 billion after tax loss on sale of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, $877 of income tax expense primarily from reducing net deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the corporate Federal income tax rate, and the effect of a pension settlement charge of $488, after tax. Apart from these charges in 2017, net income available to common stockholders increased, driven by higher net income in Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds that was partially attributable to a lower corporate Federal income tax rate in 2018. Higher earned premium and net investment income in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, including from the acquisition of Aetna’s U.S. group life and disability business, increased fee income in Hartford Funds, more favorable prior accident year development in workers’ compensation, a lower current accident year loss ratio before catastrophes in Personal Lines and improved long term disability results, were partially offset by the effect of lower Personal Lines earned premium and higher insurance operating costs and other expenses, and a change to net realized capital losses.
Earned premiums increased primarily due to the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability benefits business that has increased earned premiums in the Group Benefits segment. Earned premiums in Property and Casualty declined reflecting an 8% decline in Personal Lines, partially

offset by a 3% increase in Commercial Lines. For a discussion of the Company's operating results by segment, see MD&A - Segment Operating Summaries.
Fee income increased, reflecting higher income in Group Benefits related to an increase in administrative service contracts as a result of the acquisition from Aetna and in Hartford Funds largely due to higher average daily AUM during the year despite a decline in AUM at the end of the year.
Net investment income increased primarily due to a higher level of invested assets due to the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Investment Income.
Net realized capital losses of $112 in 2018 were down from net realized capital gains of $165 in 2017. Net losses in 2018 were primarily driven by net losses on sales of fixed maturity securities due to sector repositioning and duration, liquidity and credit management as well as net losses on equity securities resulting from depreciation in value due to lower equity market levels, partially offset by gains on sales due to tactical repositioning. For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains.
Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased in Group Benefits, partially offset by a decrease in Property & Casualty with the increase in Group Benefits primarily due to the effect of growth in earned premium

largely resulting from the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, partially offset by a lower group disability loss ratio. The decrease in incurred losses for Property & Casualty was driven by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes in Property & Casualty decreased, primarily resulting from the effect of lower Personal Lines earned premium and lower loss costs in auto, homeowners and general liability, partially offset by higher loss costs in workers’ compensation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current accident year catastrophe losses of $821, before tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased compared to $836, before tax, for the prior year period. Catastrophe losses in 2018 were primarily from wildfires in California, hurricanes Florence and Michael in the Southeast, wind and hail storms in Colorado, and various wind storms and winter storms across the country and are net of an estimated reinsurance recoverable of $82 under the 2018 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty. Catastrophe losses in 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter, California wildfires, and multiple wind and hail events across various U.S. geographic regions, primarily in the Midwest, Colorado, Texas and the Southeast. For additional information, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net prior accident year reserve development in Property & Casualty was favorable $167, before tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to favorable net reserve development of $41, before tax, for the prior year period. Prior accident year development in 2018 primarily included a decrease in reserves for workers’ compensation and a decrease in catastrophe reserves for the 2017 hurricanes.

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was relatively flat year over year as an increase in Commercial Lines was largely offset by a decrease in Personal Lines.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased due to a $750 pension settlement charge in the 2017 period, partially offset by an increase in operating costs associated with the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, increased commissions in Commercial Lines, and higher variable expenses in Hartford Funds.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased, reflecting the amortization of customer relationship intangibles in the Group Benefits segment that arose from the acquisition of the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business.
Income tax expense decreased primarily due to an $877 charge in 2017 due to a reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the lower corporate Federal income tax rate partially offset by an increase in before tax income and the effect of a lower corporate Federal income tax rate in 2018. Differences between the Company's effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% and 35% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, are due primarily to tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets, stock-based compensation, non-deductible executive compensation and the effects of Tax Reform on net deferred tax

assets. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 16 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $322 in 2018, increased from a net loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 billion in 2017. The $322 of income from discontinued operations in 2018 was mostly attributable to recognizing additional retained tax benefits from the sale of the life and annuity business in May 2018 and the reclassification of $193 of stranded tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings related to this sale, both of which reduced the estimated loss on sale. The reclassification of stranded tax effects resulted in a corresponding increase in AOCI related to the assets held for sale. For more information on the reclassification of stranded tax effects, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The $2.9 billion net loss on discontinued operations in 2017 was driven by a $3.3 billion net loss on the sale of the life and annuity business which closed on May 31, 2018.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net income (loss) available to common stockholders decreased from net income in 2016 to a net loss in 2017 primarily due to a loss on discontinued operations of $2.9 billion related to the pending sale of the life and annuity business, a charge to income tax expense of $877 arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower Federal income tax rates and a pension settlement charge of $488 after tax. Partially offsetting the decline were the effects of a $179 after tax change from net realized capital losses in 2016 to net realized capital gains in 2017, the effect of a $423 after tax charge in 2016 related to a loss on reinsurance covering the Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures and a reduction in the valuation allowance on capital loss carryovers in 2016. In addition, a $324 after tax improvement in P&C prior accident year development and higher earnings in Group Benefits and Hartford Funds were largely offset by a $273 after tax increase in current accident year catastrophes and higher variable incentive compensation.
Earned premiums increased by $444, before tax, reflecting growth of 3% in Commercial Lines, including the effect of the Maxum acquisition, and 14% in Group Benefits, including the effect of acquiring the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business, partially offset by a 5% decrease in Personal Lines. For a discussion of the Company's operating results by segment, see MD&A - Results of Operations by segment.
Fee income increased reflecting a 15% increase in Hartford Funds due to higher assets under management driven by market appreciation and positive net flows and the addition of Schroders funds in the fourth quarter of 2016. For a discussion of the Company's operating results by segment, see MD&A - Results of Operations by segment.
Net investment income increased 2%, primarily due to higher income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and increased investment expenses. For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Investment Income (Loss).

41

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Net realized capital gains of $165 before tax compared to net realized capital losses of $110 before tax in 2016, primarily due to higher net gains on sales, lower impairments and the effect of losses in 2016 related to the sale of the Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries and the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships in 2016 that generated tax benefits. For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).
Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased 11% in Group Benefits and decreased 1% in P&C. The increase in Group Benefits was largely due to the acquisition of Aetna’s U.S. group life and disability business. The decrease in P&C was primarily due to the effect of unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in 2016, largely offset by higher catastrophe losses in 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes in Property & Casualty were relatively flat, primarily resulting from improved loss ratios and lower earned premiums in Personal Lines, offset by higher loss ratios in workers' compensation and general liability.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current accident year catastrophe losses of $836, before tax, compared to $416, before tax, for the prior year period. Catastrophe losses in 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, California wildfires and multiple wind and hail events across various U.S. geographic regions, primarily in the Midwest, Colorado, Texas and the Southeast. Catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail and winter storm events across various U.S. geographic regions, concentrated in Texas and the central and southern plains and, to a lesser extent, winter storms and hurricane Matthew. For additional information, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.

• Favorable prior accident year reserve development in Property & Casualty of $41, before tax, compared to unfavorable reserve development of $457, before tax, for the prior year period. Prior accident year development in 2017 primarily included decreases in reserves for workers’ compensation and small commercial package business, partially offset by an increase in reserves for bond claims. Prior accident year development in 2016 was largely due to a $268 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves and a $160 increase in Personal Lines automobile liability reserves. For additional information, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Reserve Rollforwards and Development.

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was relatively flat as higher amortization on higher earned premium for Commercial Lines was offset by lower amortization on lower earned premium for Personal Lines.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased primarily due to a $750 pre-tax pension

settlement charge. Apart from the pension settlement charge, insurance operating costs and other expenses increased by 9%, primarily driven by higher variable incentive plan compensation, increased IT costs in Commercial Lines, higher variable expenses in Hartford Funds and $20, before tax, of state guaranty fund assessments in Group Benefits, partially offset by lower direct marketing and operation costs in Personal Lines. Effective with awards granted in March 2017, long-term incentive compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees now fully vest when they are granted, which resulted in an accelerated recognition of compensation expense in 2017 of $22 before tax. For additional information on the pension settlement charge in second quarter 2017, see Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased by $10 largely due to amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business, including in-force contracts, customer relationships and a marketing agreement with Aetna.
Income tax expense increased primarily due to a charge of $877 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") enacted in December, 2017. Among other changes, Tax Reform reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 which resulted in a reduction of the Company's net deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryovers. Also contributing to the increase in income tax expense were Federal income tax benefits of $113 in 2016 arising from investments in solar energy partnerships that generated tax benefits and the effect of a federal income tax benefit of $65 in 2016 related to the sale of the Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
Differences between the Company's effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% are due primarily to the effects of Tax Reform on net deferred tax assets, tax exempt interest earned on invested assets, changes in the valuation allowance recorded on capital loss carryovers and federal tax credits associated with investments in solar energy partnerships. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 16 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased from income of $283 in 2016 to a net loss of $2.9 billion in 2017 with the net loss in 2017 due to a loss on sale of the Company’s life and annuity business of $3.3 billion, partially offset by operating income from discontinued operations of $388. Operating income from discontinued operations increased from $283 in 2016 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses in 2017. Apart from the reduction in net realized capital losses, earnings were relatively flat as an increase in the unlock benefit and lower interest credited were largely offset by lower net investment income and lower fee income due to the continued run off of the variable annuity block.

Total investments increased primarily due to an increase in short-term investments and mortgage loans, largely offset by a decrease in fixed maturities, AFS.
Fixed maturities, AFS decreased primarily due to a decrease in valuations due to widening of spreads and higher interest rates.

Short-term investments increased due to proceeds from the sale of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 and holding additional short-term investments in preparation to fund the Navigators acquisition and debt that matured in January 2019.
Mortgage Loans increased largely due to new originations of commercial mortgage loans within the industrial, multifamily and single family markets.

[3] Primarily includes income from derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and hedge fixed maturities.

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Total net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from fixed maturities as a result of higher average asset levels during 2018 as compared to 2017 largely driven by the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business in November 2017. In addition, total net investment

income increased due to higher returns on private equity and real estate limited partnership investments as well as a higher reinvestment rate on fixed maturities.
Annualized net investment income yield, excluding non-routine items which include prepayment penalties on mortgage loans and make-whole payments on fixed maturities, was 3.7% in 2018 up from 3.6% for the same period for 2017.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Average reinvestment rate, excluding certain U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended December 31, 2018, was approximately 4.0% which was above the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.7% for the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average reinvestment rate of 4.0% increased from 3.5% for the 2017 period, due to higher interest rates.
We expect the annualized net investment income yield for the 2019 calendar year, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to approximate the portfolio yield earned in 2018 though it could be higher depending on if reinvestment rates stay above the sales/maturity yield. The estimated impact on net investment income yield is subject to change as the composition of the portfolio changes through portfolio management and changes in market conditions.

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Total net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from limited partnerships and other  alternative investments, partially offset by lower make whole  payment income on fixed  maturities and increased investment expense. Income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments increased due to higher valuation write-ups of  private equity partnerships and strong returns on real estate  investments in 2017.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.
The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• group benefit long-term disability (LTD) reserves, net of reinsurance;

- --------------------------------------
• evaluation of goodwill for impairment;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans;

- -----------------------------------------------
• valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.

Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In developing these estimates

management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.

Overview of Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims
It typically takes many months or years to pay claims incurred under a property and casualty insurance product; accordingly, the Company must establish reserves at the time the loss is incurred. Most of the Company’s policies provide for occurrence-based coverage where the loss is incurred when a claim event happens like an automobile accident, house or building fire or injury to an employee under a workers’ compensation policy. Some of the Company's policies, mostly for directors and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance, are claims-made policies where the loss is incurred in the period the claim event is reported to the Company even if the loss event itself occurred in an earlier period.
Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company, less amounts paid to date. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual loss and loss adjustment expenses reported to the Company by claimants (“reported losses”). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.
Factors that Change Reserve Estimates- Reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. Inflation in medical care, hospital care, automobile parts, wages and home and building repair would cause claims to settle for more than they are initially reserved. Changes in the economy can cause an increase or decrease in the number of reported claims (claim frequency). For example, an improving economy could result in more automobile miles driven and a higher number of automobile reported claims, or a change in economic conditions can lead to more or less workers’ compensation reported claims. An increase in the number or percentage of claims litigated can increase the average settlement amount per claim (claim severity). Changes in the judicial environment can affect interpretations of damages and how policy coverage applies which could increase or decrease claim severity. Over time, judges or juries in certain jurisdictions may be more inclined to determine liability and award damages. New legislation can also change how damages are defined resulting in greater frequency or severity. In addition, new types of injuries may arise from exposures not contemplated when the policies were written. Past examples include pharmaceutical products, silica, lead paint, molestation or abuse and construction defects.
Reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal Company operations. A delay or acceleration in handling claims may signal a need to increase or reduce reserves from what was initially estimated. New lines of business may have loss development patterns that are not well established. Changes in the geographic mix of business, changes in the mix of business

by industry and changes in the mix of business by policy limit or deductible can increase the risk that losses will ultimately develop differently than the loss development patterns assumed in our reserving. In addition, changes in the quality of risk selection in underwriting and changes in interpretations of policy language could increase or decrease ultimate losses from what was assumed in establishing the reserves.
In the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. The Company assumes insurance risk from certain pools and associations and, prior to 2004, assumed property and casualty risks from other insurance companies. Changes in the case reserving and reporting patterns of insurance companies ceding to The Hartford can create additional uncertainty in estimating the reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates of direct and assumed reserves, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.
Reinsurance Recoverables- Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company records reinsurance recoverables for loss and loss adjustment expenses ceded to its reinsurers representing the anticipated recovery from reinsurers of unpaid claims, including IBNR.
The Company estimates the portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses to be ceded based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how IBNR for losses will ultimately be ceded.
The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The estimated allowance considers the credit quality of the Company's reinsurers, recent outcomes in arbitration and litigation in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and recent communication activity between reinsurers and cedants that may signal how the Company’s own reinsurance claims may settle. Where its reinsurance contracts permit, the Company secures funding of future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $126 as of December 31, 2018, comprised of $20 related to Commercial Lines, $1 related to Personal Lines and $105 related to Property & Casualty Other Operations.
The Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.
Review of Reserve Adequacy- The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. For Property & Casualty Other Operations, asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) reserves are reviewed by type of event rather than by line of business.
Reserve adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is

determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in recording the reinsurance recoverables for ceded unpaid losses.
Reserving Methodology
For a discussion of how A&E reserves are set, see MD&A - P&C Insurance Product Reserves, Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Property & Casualty Other Operations. The following is a discussion of the reserving methods used for the Company's property and casualty lines of business other than asbestos and environmental.
How Reserves Are Set- Reserves are set by line of business within the operating segments. A single line of business may be written in more than one segment. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest-tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
Use of Actuarial Methods and Judgments- The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. In 2018, new methods were added to inform these selections where appropriate. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. Most reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for homeowners, commercial property, automobile physical damage, automobile liability, package property business, and workers’ compensation. Other reserves, including most general liability and professional liability lines, are reviewed semi-annually. Certain additional reserves are also reviewed semi-annually or annually, including reserves for losses incurred in accident years older than twelve years for Personal Lines and older than twenty years for Commercial Lines, as well as reserves for bond, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures such as construction defects, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses. For reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters and, if necessary, performs a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.
An expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. This expected

loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period.
As losses emerge or develop in periods subsequent to a given accident year, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more influence vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to herein as the “actuarial indication”.
Reserve Discounting- Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies. For further discussion of these discounted liabilities, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Differences Between GAAP and Statutory Basis Reserves- As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, U.S. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under U.S. GAAP were less than net reserves reported on a statutory basis. The primary difference between the statutory and GAAP reserve amounts is due to a reinsurance recoverable on ceded asbestos and environmental adverse reserve development under a retroactive reinsurance agreement between the Company and National Indemnity Company ("NICO"), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire"), which is included as a reduction of other liabilities under statutory accounting.
Reserving Methods by Line of Business- Apart from A&E which is discussed in the following section on Property & Casualty Other Operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change.

Commercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage These short-tailed lines are fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used as these methods use historical data to develop paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to cumulative paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. In addition to paid and reported development methods, for the most immature accident months, the Company uses frequency and severity techniques and the initial expected loss ratio. The advantage of frequency/severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in estimating average severity.
Personal automobile liability For automobile liability, and bodily injury in particular, the Company performs a greater number of techniques than it does for commercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage. In addition to traditional paid and reported development methods, the Company relies on frequency/severity techniques and Berquist-Sherman techniques. Because the paid development technique is affected by changes in claim closure patterns and the reported development method is affected by changes in case reserving practices, the Company uses Berquist-Sherman techniques which adjust these patterns to reflect current settlement rates and case reserving practices. The Company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years and a combination of reported development, frequency/severity and Berquist-Sherman methods for more recent accident years. For older accident periods, reported losses are a good indicator of ultimate losses given the high percentage of ultimate losses reported to date. For more recent periods, the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by changes in case reserve practices and changing disposal rates and the Berquist-Sherman techniques specifically adjust for these changes.
Automobile liability for commercial lines For older, more mature accident years, the Company primarily uses reported development techniques. For more recent accident years, the Company relies on several methods that incorporate expected loss ratios, reported loss development, paid loss development, frequency/severity, case reserve adequacy, and claim settlement rates.
Professional liability Reported and paid loss development patterns for this line tend to be volatile. Therefore, the Company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques.
General liability, bond and large deductible workers’ compensation For these long-tailed lines of business, the Company generally relies on the expected loss ratio and reported development techniques. The Company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and more on the reported development method as an accident year matures.
Workers’ compensation Workers’ compensation is the Company’s single largest reserve line of business and a wide range of methods are used. Methods include paid and reported development techniques, the expected loss ratio and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, and an in-depth analysis on the largest states. In recent years, we have seen an acceleration of paid losses relative to historical patterns and have adjusted our expected loss development patterns accordingly. This acceleration is due to an increase in lump sum settlements to claimants across multiple accident years. Adjusting for the effect of an acceleration in payments compared to historical patterns, paid loss development techniques are generally preferred for the workers' compensation line, particularly for more mature accident years. For less mature accident years, the Company places greater reliance on expected loss ratio methods.
Assumed reinsurance and all other For these lines, the Company tends to rely mostly on reported development techniques. In assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by information gained from claim and underwriting audits.
Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) For some lines of business (e.g., professional liability and assumed reinsurance), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid ALAE to paid loss is applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid ALAE.
Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) ULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For most lines of business, incurred ULAE costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an expected claim handling cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss is applied to estimated unpaid losses.

In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves. As of December 31, 2018, recorded reserves were above the actuarial indications by an amount comparable with December 31, 2017.
Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. In general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Such

adjustments of reserves are referred to as “prior accident year development”. Increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. Decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results.
For a discussion of changes to reserve estimates recorded in 2018, see the Reserve Development section below.
Current Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty
The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. The Hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time. As market conditions and loss trends develop, management must

48

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve).
General liability- Within Commercial Lines and Property & Casualty Other Operations, the Company has exposure to general liability claims, including from bodily injury, property damage and product liability. Reserves for these exposures can be particularly difficult to estimate due to the long development pattern and uncertainty about how cases will settle. In particular, the Company has exposure to bodily injury claims that is the result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. In addition, the Company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. These factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the Company monitors trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the Company’s reserves.
Workers’ compensation- Included in middle market and specialty commercial, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest line of business and the property and casualty line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. To the extent that patterns in the frequency of settlement payments deviate from historical patterns, loss reserve estimates would be less reliable. Medical costs make up approximately 50% of workers’ compensation payments. As such, reserve estimates for workers’ compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. In addition, a deteriorating economic environment can reduce the ability of an injured worker to return to work and lengthen the time a worker receives disability benefits. Within specialty commercial, reserves for large deductible workers’ compensation insurance require estimating losses attributable to the deductible amount that will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company is contractually liable.
Commercial Lines automobile-Uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability for commercial automobile losses including reserve variability due to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as due to changes in the external environment.
Directors' and officers' insurance- Uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits can result in reserve volatility for both directors' and officers' insurance claims. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to losses under directors’ and officers’ insurance policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex.
Personal Lines automobile- In Personal Lines, while claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends, particularly for auto liability

claims. Severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment. Changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. Severity trends have increased in recent accident years, in part driven by more expensive parts associated with new automobile technology, causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. In addition, the introduction of new products and class plans has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business.
Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves
As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements within its reserve estimation process. The Company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.
Across most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.
The following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. For automobile liability lines in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. For workers’ compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. For workers’ compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. For general liability, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims.
Each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in total. For any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. The variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and, therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below.

Workers' Compensation 2.0% change in paid loss development patterns $10.0 billion +/- $400

Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims
How A&E Reserves are Set- The process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables. In establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. The Company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, the level of plaintiff demands, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.
Similarly, the Company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. The Company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities or mandated remediation efforts and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.
After evaluating its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the Company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. The Company considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language, the nature of how policy limits are enforced on multi-year policies and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

The estimated liabilities of insureds and the Company’s exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.
For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. The historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance.
Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance collections. See the section that follows entitled Adverse Development Cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with NICO may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.
Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of A&E Reserves- A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. Reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures.
The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. Future developments could cause the Company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves and if cumulative ceded losses under the adverse development cover (“ADC”) with NICO exceed the ceded premium paid of $650, there could be significant variability in net income due to timing differences between when gross reserves are increased and when reinsurance recoveries are recognized. Consistent with past practice, the Company will continue to monitor its reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. Where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time. In 2018 and 2017, the Company completed the comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter, instead of the second quarter as it had done in previous years.
Total P&C Insurance Product Reserves Development
In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2018 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant

50

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

uncertainties surrounding reserves, it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change in the future and that the required adjustment to

currently recorded reserves could be material to the Company’s results of operations and liquidity.

During 2018, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, primarily for accident years 2014 and 2015, as claim severity has emerged favorably compared to previous reserve estimates. Also contributing was a reduction in estimated reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expense ("ULAE").
General liability reserves were increased, primarily due to an increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures in middle market for accident years 2009 to 2017, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for other lines within middle market, including premises and operations, umbrella and products liability, principally for accident years 2015 and prior. Contributing to the increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures was an increase in average claim severity, including from large losses and, in more recent accident years, an increase in claim frequency. Contributing to the reduction in reserves for other middle market lines were more favorable outcomes due to initiatives to reduce legal expenses. In addition, reserve increases for claims with lead paint exposure were offset by reserve decreases for other mass torts and extra-contractual liability claims.
Package business reserves were reduced, primarily due to lower reserve estimates for both liability and property for accident years 2010 and prior, including a recovery of loss adjustment expenses for the 2005 accident year.
Commercial property reserves were reduced, driven by an increase in estimated reinsurance recoverables on middle market property losses from the 2017 accident year.
Professional liability reserves were reduced, principally for accident years 2014 and prior, for directors and

officers liability claims principally due to a number of older claims closing with limited or no payment.
Automobile liability reserves were reduced, primarily driven by reduced estimates of loss adjustment expenses in small commercial for recent accident years and favorable development in personal automobile liability for accident years 2014 to 2017, principally due to lower severity, including with uninsured and underinsured motorist claims.
Homeowners reserves were reduced, primarily in accident years 2013 to 2017, driven by lower than expected severity across multiple perils.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $238 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2018 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $238 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Catastrophe reserves were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 catastrophes, principally related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Before reinsurance, estimated losses for 2017 catastrophe events decreased by $133, resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $90 as the Company no longer expects to recover under the 2017 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty as aggregate ultimate losses for 2017 catastrophe events are now projected to be less than $850.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves were increased due to lower anticipated recoveries related to older accident years.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, primarily represents an increase in ULAE reserves in Property & Casualty

During 2017, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, given the continued emergence of favorable frequency, primarily for accident years 2013 to 2015, as well as a reduction in estimated reserves for ULAE, partially offset by strengthening reserves for captive programs within specialty commercial.
General liability reserves were increased for the 2013 to 2016 accident years on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in recent accident year reserves for other middle market general liability reserves.
Package business reserves were reduced for accident years 2013 and prior largely due to reducing the Company’s estimate of allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to settle the claims.
Bond business reserves increased for customs bonds written between 2000 and 2010 which was partly offset by a reduction in reserves for recent accident years as reported losses for commercial and contract surety have emerged favorably.

Automobile liability reserves within Commercial Lines were increased in small commercial and large national accounts for the 2013 to 2016 accident years, driven by higher frequency of more severe accidents, including litigated claims.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $285 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2017 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $285 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Catastrophes reserves were reduced primarily due to lower estimates of 2016 wind and hail event losses and a decrease in losses on a 2015 wildfire.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

Total prior accident year development $ 28 $ 151 $ 278 $ 457

During 2016, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
Workers' compensation reserves consider favorable emergence on reported losses for recent accident years as well as a partially offsetting adverse impact related to two recent Florida Supreme Court rulings that have increased the Company’s exposure to workers’ compensation claims in that state. The favorable emergence has been driven by lower frequency and, to a lesser extent, lower medical severity and management has placed additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.
General liability reserves increased for accident years 2012 - 2015 primarily due to higher severity losses incurred on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors and increased for accident years 2008 and 2010 primarily due to indemnity losses and legal costs associated with a litigated claim.
Package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, principally for accident years 2013 - 2015. Severity for these accident years has developed unfavorably and management has placed more weight on emerged experience.
Professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2008 - 2013, primarily for large accounts, including on non-securities class action cases. Claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.
Automobile liability reserves increased due to increases in both commercial lines automobile and personal lines automobile. Commercial automobile liability reserves increased, predominately for the 2015 accident year, primarily due to increased frequency of large claims. Personal automobile liability reserves increased, primarily related to increased bodily injury

frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year, including for uninsured and under-insured motorist claims, and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. Increases in automobile liability loss costs were across both the direct and agency distribution channels.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the second quarter 2016 comprehensive annual review.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

Property & Casualty Other Operations
Net reserves and reserve activity in Property & Casualty Other Operations are categorized and reported as Asbestos, Environmental, and “All other”. The “All other” category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, head injuries, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. In addition to various insurance and assumed reinsurance exposures, "All other" includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. "All other" also includes the Company’s allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When the Company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, net reserves for the related cause of loss (including asbestos, environmental or all other) are increased for the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Adverse Development Cover
Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed in a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016, will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to net losses incurred before ceding to the ADC. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of A&E claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred a cumulative $523 in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO, leaving approximately $977 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any.
Net and Gross Survival Ratios
Net and gross survival ratios are a measure of the quotient of the carried reserves divided by average annual payments (net of reinsurance and on a gross basis) and is an indication of the number of years that carried reserves would last (i.e. survive) if future annual payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.
The survival ratios shown below are calculated for the one and three year periods ended December 31, 2018. The net basis survival ratio has been materially affected by the adverse development cover entered into between the Company and NICO. The Company cedes adverse asbestos and environmental development in excess of its December 31, 2016 net carried reserves of $1.7 billion to NICO up to a limit of $1.5 billion. Since December 31, 2016, net reserves for asbestos and environmental have been declining as the Company has had no net incurred losses but continues to pay down net loss reserves. This has the effect of reducing the one- and three-year net survival ratios shown in the table below. For asbestos, the table also presents the net survival ratios excluding the effect of the PPG settlement in 2016. See section that follows entitled Major Categories of Asbestos Accounts for discussion of the PPG settlement.

Annual Reserve Reviews
Review of Asbestos Reserves
Since 2017, the Company has performed its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos reserves in the fourth quarter. As part of the evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
During the 2018 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance by $167, primarily due to an increase in average mesothelioma settlement values driven by elevated plaintiff demands and defendant bankruptcies. The rise in plaintiff demands also resulted in higher than anticipated defense costs for a small subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of asbestos filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. In addition, the Company observed unfavorable developments in the application of coverage that resulted in increased liability shares on certain insureds. An

58

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

increase in reserves from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years contributed to the adverse development. The increase in reserves was offset by a $167 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.
As a result of the 2017 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance by $183, primarily due to mesothelioma claim filings not declining as expected, unfavorable developments in coverage law in some jurisdictions and continued filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. An increase in reserves from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years contributed to the adverse development. This increase in reserves was offset by a $183 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.
During the 2016 second quarter review, a substantial majority of the Company’s direct accounts trended as expected, and the Company observed no material changes in the underlying legal environment. However, mesothelioma claims filings have not declined as expected for a small subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of asbestos filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. As a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs did not decline as expected. While the mesothelioma and adverse jurisdiction claim trends observed in the 2016 comprehensive annual review were similar to the 2015 comprehensive annual review, most of the defendants that had reserve increases in the 2016 review did not have a material impact in the 2015 review. Based on this evaluation, the Company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $197 in second quarter 2016.
Review of Environmental Reserves
Since 2017, the Company has performed its regular comprehensive annual review of environmental reserves in the fourth quarter. As part of its evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
As a result of the 2018 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance by $71 due to increased defense and clean-up costs associated with increasingly complex remediation plans at Superfund sites, intensifying regulatory scrutiny by state agencies (particularly in the Pacific Northwest), and increased liability shares due to unavailability of other responsible parties. The increase in environmental reserves was offset by a $71 reinsurance recoverable under the NICO treaty.
As a result of the 2017 comprehensive annual review, the Company increased estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance by $102. This increase was offset by a reinsurance recoverable of $102 under the NICO cover. A substantial majority of the Company’s direct environmental accounts trended as expected. However, a small percentage of the Company’s direct accounts exhibited deterioration due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with Superfund sites and sediments in waterways, as well as adverse legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.
During the 2016 comprehensive annual review, a substantial majority of the Company's direct environmental accounts trended as expected. However, a small percentage of the Company's direct accounts exhibited deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for coverage, increased defense

costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways. Based on this evaluation, the Company increased its net environmental reserves for prior year development by $71 in second quarter 2016.
Major Categories of Asbestos Accounts
Direct asbestos exposures include both Known and Unallocated Direct Accounts.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Known Direct Accounts- includes both Major Asbestos Defendants and Non-Major Accounts, and represent approximately 69% of the Company's total Direct gross asbestos reserves as of December 31, 2018 compared to approximately 63% as of December 31, 2017. Major Asbestos Defendants have been defined as the “Top 70” accounts in Tillinghast's published Tiers 1 and 2 and Wellington accounts, while Non-Major accounts are comprised of all other direct asbestos accounts and largely represent smaller and more peripheral defendants. Major Asbestos Defendants have the fewest number of asbestos accounts and up through second quarter 2016 had included reserves related to PPG Industries, Inc. (“PPG”). In May 2016, the Company pre-paid its funding obligation in the amount of $315 as permitted under the settlement agreement, arising from participation in a 2002 settlement of asbestos liabilities of PPG. The Company's funding obligation approximated the amount reserved for this exposure.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Unallocated Direct Accounts- includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the Company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. These exposures represent approximately 31% of the Company's Direct gross asbestos reserves as of December 31, 2018 compared to approximately 37% as of December 31, 2017.

Review of "All Other" Reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations
In the fourth quarters of 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company completed evaluations of certain of its non-asbestos and non-environmental reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities, unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves, and allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.  Overall prior year development on all other reserves resulted in increases (decreases) of $65, $18 and $(20), respectively for calendar years 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Included in the 2018 adverse reserve development was a $38 increase in reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, primarily due to an increase in expected aggregate claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental claims.
The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay.  During the second and third quarters of 2018, the Company increased the allowance by $19, largely driven by potential coverage disputes on a limited number of claims.  During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, and second quarter of 2016, the Company completed its annual evaluations of the collectability of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in

59

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Property & Casualty Other Operations.  In conducting these evaluations, the company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment.  The Company analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Property & Casualty Other Operations totaled $105, $86 and $136, respectively.  Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required.

Impact of Re-estimates on Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves
Estimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements.

Ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. Prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.
The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the past ten years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. The ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. For further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see Preferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business - Impact of Changes in Key Assumptions on Reserve Volatility section.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Excluding the reserve increases for asbestos and environmental reserves, over the past ten years, reserve re-estimates for total property and casualty insurance ranged from (2.5%) to 1.0%.

The potential variability of the Company’s property and casualty insurance product reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments. Illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates for Property & Casualty Insurance Product Reserves and Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. See the section entitled Property & Casualty Other Operations, Annual Reserve Reviews about the impact that the ADC retroactive reinsurance agreement with NICO may have on net reserve changes of asbestos and environmental reserves going forward.

The following table summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2018. The total of each column details the amount of reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates during the ten year period ended December 31, 2018 for the indicated accident year in each row.

Accident years 2008 and Prior
The net increases in estimates of ultimate losses for accident years 2008 and prior are driven mostly by increased reserves for asbestos and environmental reserves, and also by increased estimates for customs bonds and other mass torts claims.
Partially offsetting these reserve increases was favorable development in general liability and workers’ compensation. Additionally, reserves for professional liability were reduced due to a lower estimate of claim severity in both directors’ and officers’ and errors and omissions insurance claims. Reserves for personal automobile liability claims were reduced largely due to improvement in emerged claim severity.
Accident year 2009
Estimates of ultimate losses have emerged favorably for accident year 2009 mainly related to personal automobile liability.
Accident years 2010 and 2011
Unfavorable changes in estimates of ultimate losses on accident years 2010 and 2011 were primarily related to workers' compensation and commercial automobile liability. Workers' compensation loss cost trends were higher than initially expected as an increase in frequency outpaced a moderation of severity trends. Unfavorable commercial automobile liability reserve re-estimates were driven by higher frequency of large loss bodily injury claims.
Accident years 2012 and 2013
Estimates of ultimate losses were decreased for accident years 2012 and 2013 due to favorable frequency and/or medical severity trends for workers’ compensation, favorable professional liability claim emergence, and lower frequency of late emerging general liability claims for the 2012 accident year. Favorable emergence of property lines of business, including catastrophes, for the 2013 accident year, is partially offset by increased reserves in automobile liability due to increased severity of large claims.
Accident years 2014 and 2015
Changes in estimates of ultimate losses for accident years 2014 and 2015 were largely driven by unfavorable frequency and

severity trends for personal and commercial automobile liability and increased severity of liability claims on package business, offset by favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers' compensation.
Accident year 2016
Estimates of ultimate losses were decreased for the 2016 accident year largely due to reserve decreases on short-tail lines of business, where results emerge more quickly, somewhat offset by unfavorable reserve estimates for higher hazard general liability exposures due to increased frequency and severity trends.
Accident year 2017
Ultimate loss estimates were increased for the 2017 accident year mainly due to unfavorable reserve estimates in general liability, bond and commercial auto liability, largely offset by a reserve release related to catastrophes. General liability was related to higher hazard exposures which experienced increased frequency and severity trends. Unfavorable bond reserve re-estimates were driven by one large claim.

Group Benefit Long-term Disability ("LTD") Reserves, Net of Reinsurance
The Company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both outstanding reported claims and claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. These reserve estimates can change over time based on facts and interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including The Hartford’s experience with similar cases, claim payment patterns, loss control programs and mix of business. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by various external factors including court decisions and economic conditions. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an

61

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

individual claim basis. The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for LTD claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. The Company held $6,767 and $6,807 of LTD unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Reserving Methodology
How Reserves are Set - A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all future benefit payments starting with the known monthly gross benefit which is reduced for estimates of the expected claim recovery due to return to work or claimant death, offsets from other income including offsets from Social Security benefits, and discounting where the discount rate is tied to expected investment yield at the time the claim is incurred. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.
The DLR also includes a liability for potential payments to pending claimants beyond the elimination period who have not yet been approved for LTD. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience.
Estimates for incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims are made by applying completion factors to expected emerged experience by line of business.  Included within IBNR are bulk reserves for claims reported but still within the waiting period, typically 3 or 6 months depending on the contract.  Completion factors are derived from standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The reserves include an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and line of business, where emerged claims for an incurral year are not yet credible enough to be a basis for estimating reserves.  In these cases, the ultimate loss is estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio based on pricing assumptions of claim incidence, claim severity, and earned pricing.
Current Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty
In group insurance, LTD has the longest pattern of loss emergence and the highest reserve amount. One significant risk to the reserve would be a slowdown in recoveries. In particular, the economic environment can affect the ability of a disabled employee to return-to-work and the length of time an employee receives disability benefits. Another significant risk is a change in benefit offsets. Often the Company pays a reduced benefit due to offsets from other income sources such as pensions or Social Security Disability Insurance ("SSDI"). Possible changes to the frequency, timing, or amount of offsets, such as a change in SSDI

approval standards or benefit offerings, create a risk that the amount to settle open claims will exceed initial estimates. Since the monthly income benefit for a claimant is established based on the individual’s salary at the time of disability and the level of coverages and benefits provided, inflation is not considered a significant risk to the reserve estimate. Few of the Company’s LTD policies provide for cost of living adjustments to the monthly income benefit.
Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves
The key assumptions affecting our group life and accident & health reserves include:
Discount Rate - The discount rate is the interest rate at which expected future claim cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. A higher selected discount rate results in a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to cover the discount accretion on our claim reserves which would negatively affect our profits. For each incurral year, the discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned net of investment expenses. The incurral year is the year in which the claim is incurred and the estimated settlement pattern is determined. Once established, discount rates for each incurral year are unchanged except that LTD reserves assumed from the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business are all discounted using current rates as of the November 1, 2017 acquisition date. The weighted average discount rate on LTD reserves was 3.4% and 3.5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our LTD unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $32, pretax, as of December 31, 2018.
Claim Termination Rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - Claim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a given calendar year. Terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. The probability that benefits will terminate in each future month for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past Company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age. Actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. Over the past 10 years, claim termination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 6% below to 13% above current assumptions over that time period. For a single recent incurral year (such as 2018), a one percent decrease in our assumption for LTD claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $9. For all incurral years combined, as of December 31, 2018, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our LTD claim termination rates would increase our Group Benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $22.

Evaluation of Goodwill for Impairment
Goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the goodwill carrying value.
The estimated fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for Hartford Funds, and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairment.
A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated include small commercial within the Commercial Lines segment, Group Benefits, Personal Lines and Hartford Funds.
The carrying value of goodwill is $1,290 as of December 31, 2018 and is comprised of $38 for small commercial, $272 for Hartford Funds, $861 for Group Benefits and $119 for Personal Lines.
The annual goodwill assessment for the small commercial, Hartford Funds, Group Benefits and Personal Lines reporting units was completed as of October 31, 2018, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2018. All reporting units passed the first step of the annual impairment test with a significant margin. For information regarding the 2017 and 2016 impairment tests see Note 10 -Goodwill & Other Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments
Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in

priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments are determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. For further discussion, see the Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments and Free-standing Derivatives section in Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Evaluation of OTTI on Available-for-sale Securities and Valuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans
Each quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment (“impairment”) is present for AFS securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see the Significant Investment Accounting Policies Section in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of impairments recorded, see the Other-than-temporary Impairments within the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of the MD&A.

Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and certain tax carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2018, including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no valuation allowance. The reduction in the valuation

63

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

allowance in 2016 stems primarily from taxable gains on the termination of derivatives during the period. The Company’s net operating loss carryovers, if unused, would expire between 2026 and 2036. As of December 31, 2018, the Company projects there will be sufficient future taxable income to fully recover the remainder of its loss carryovers, though the Company's estimate of the likely realization may change over time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had AMT credit carryovers of $841 which are reflected as a current income tax receivable within Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. AMT credits may be used to offset a regular tax liability for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and are refundable at an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Any remaining credits not used against regular tax liability are refundable in the 2021 tax year to be realized in 2022. For additional information about Tax Reform, see Note - 16, Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible, and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.

Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters
Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management

establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.
The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Underlying combined ratio 91.5 92.0 89.4

2019 Outlook
The Company expects higher Commercial Lines written premiums in 2019, driven by continued strong policy retention in small commercial and national accounts, growth in industry verticals in middle market and an increase in new business across Commercial Lines. Management expects positive renewal written pricing in all lines of business except workers' compensation, which is expected to be flat to down modestly. In addition to the impact of pricing trends, written premium growth in 2019 will depend on economic conditions as economic growth is expected to moderate in 2019.
Pricing varies significantly by product line with low-to-mid single digit pricing increases expected in property and general liability and higher written pricing increases expected in commercial automobile. In workers’ compensation, given favorable profitability trends, rates are expected to decline in 2019.
The Company expects the Commercial Lines combined ratio will be between approximately 94.5 and 96.5 for 2019, compared to 92.6 in 2018, largely due to lower favorable prior year development, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses expected in 2019. The underlying combined ratio is expected to be flat to slightly higher as earned pricing increases may not keep pace with moderate increases in loss costs, and the Company continues to invest in the business . Current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 3.0 points of the combined ratio in 2019 compared to 3.9 points in 2018.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income increased in 2018 due to a higher underwriting gain, a lower corporate Federal income tax rate and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net investment income, partially offset by a shift from net realized capital gains in 2017 to net realized capital losses in 2018. (For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results).
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net income decreased in 2017 due to a lower underwriting gain, partially offset by increases in net investment income and net realized capital gains. (For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results).
Underwriting Gain

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Underwriting gain increased in 2018 primarily due to more favorable prior accident year reserve development in 2018 compared to 2017, lower current accident year catastrophes, and higher earned premium, partially offset by higher underwriting expenses, including higher amortization of DAC.

66

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Underwriting gain decreased in 2017 primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and higher underwriting expenses largely driven by an increase in variable incentive compensation and higher IT costs. Also contributing to the decrease were higher current accident year loss costs for workers’ compensation, general liability and non-catastrophe property, offset by the effect of earned premium growth and a change from unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016 to favorable development in 2017.
Earned Premiums

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Other of $45, $46, and $42 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, is included in the total.

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Earned premiums increased in 2018 reflecting written premium growth over the preceding twelve months.
Written premiums increased in 2018 primarily due to growth in middle market, small commercial and specialty commercial. In standard commercial lines, renewal written price increases declined in 2018, mostly attributable to bigger rate decreases in small commercial workers' compensation. New business and renewal written premium increased across most lines of business, particularly in middle market, partially offset by declines in small commercial workers' compensation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Small commercial written premium increased in 2018, primarily driven by the business acquired under a renewal

rights agreement with Farmers Group to acquire its Foremost-branded small commercial business. The increase in new business premium was largely offset by the decline in renewal premium. The decline in renewal premium was driven by the effect of lower policy retention, partially offset by renewal written price increases.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Middle market written premium growth in 2018 was primarily due to strong new business growth, improved retention and higher renewal written price increases.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Specialty commercial written premium increased in 2018 driven by growth in financial products and bond, partially offset by a decline in National Accounts.

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Earned premiums increased in 2017 reflecting written premium growth over the preceding twelve months.
Written premiums increased in 2017 primarily due to growth in small commercial.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Small commercial written premium growth for 2017 was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by renewal written price increases and growth from the acquisition of Maxum, partially offset by lower new business premium, excluding Maxum, and the effect of lower policy retention.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Middle market written premiums in 2017 were up modestly as higher new and renewal premium was partially offset by modestly higher property reinsurance costs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Specialty commercial written premiums in 2017 were up slightly as growth in Bond was largely offset by new business declines in National Accounts.

Loss and LAE Ratio before Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development
Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased slightly in 2018, primarily due to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in general liability and commercial auto. The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for workers' compensation was relatively flat as the effect of higher claim frequency was largely offset by the benefit of increased audit premium driven by higher than initially estimated insured payroll.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Loss and LAE ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development increased in 2017, primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in both workers' compensation and general liability, as well as higher commercial property losses in middle market. The workers’ compensation current accident year loss ratio deteriorated from 2016 to 2017 as increases in average claim severity outpaced the effect of earned pricing and a modest reduction in loss cost frequency.

Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2018 were lower than in 2017 with catastrophes in 2018 primarily from hurricanes Florence and Michael in the Southeast, wildfires in California, wind and hail storms in Colorado, and various wind storms and winter storms across the country. Catastrophe losses in 2018 are net of an estimated reinsurance recoverable of $28 under the 2018 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty that was allocated to Commercial Lines. Catastrophe losses in 2017 were primarily from hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as from wind and hail events in the Midwest, Texas and Colorado.
Prior accident year development was a net favorable $200, before tax, for 2018 compared to favorable $22, before tax, for 2017. Net reserve decreases for 2018 were primarily related to decreases for workers' compensation, catastrophes and unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves, partially offset by an increase in general liability reserves. Estimated losses for 2017 catastrophe events in Commercial Lines decreased by $93 in 2018 resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $43 as the Company no longer expects to recover under the 2017 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2017 were primarily from hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as from wind and hail events in the Midwest, Texas and Colorado. Catastrophe losses for 2016 were primarily due to wind and hail events and winter storms across various U.S. geographic regions.
Prior accident year development was favorable in 2017 compared to unfavorable prior accident year development

in 2016. Net reserve decreases for 2017 were primarily related to reduced loss reserve estimates for workers' compensation and small commercial package business, partially offset by reserve increases for bond.

2019 Outlook
In 2019, the Company expects the level of pricing increases for automobile and homeowners across the industry to decrease, as loss cost trends have moderated. Accordingly, the Company expects written pricing increases in 2019 to be in the mid single-digits for automobile and high single-digits for homeowners. Written premium is expected to decline slightly in 2019 as non-renewal of premium more than offsets new business growth, particularly in the agency channel. The Company expects to drive new business growth in more states in 2019, particularly in the direct channel.

The Company expects the combined ratio for Personal Lines will be between approximately 97.5 and 99.5 for 2019 compared to 106.3 in 2018, primarily due to lower current accident year catastrophes with the underlying combined ratio flat to slightly higher, as the Company increases spending on marketing. Current accident year catastrophes are budgeted to be 6.5 points of the combined ratio in 2019 compared with 16.1 points in 2018. For automobile, we expect the underlying combined ratio to improve slightly as a modest loss ratio improvement is partially offset by an increase in acquisition costs to increase new business. While management actions, including the effect of earned pricing, are expected to modestly exceed an increase in loss cost severity,

70

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

those will be partially offset by an increase in direct marketing and other expenses to generate new business. The underlying combined ratio for homeowners is expected to increase slightly in 2019, driven by a return to a more normal level of non-catastrophe weather loss experience and higher acquisition costs, partially offset by earned pricing increases.
Net Loss

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net loss was higher in 2018 than in 2017 due to a higher underwriting loss, a change to net realized capital losses and the effect of a lower corporate income tax rate, partially offset by higher net investment income.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net loss in 2017 was unchanged from 2016 as lower underwriting loss and higher net realized capital gains was offset by $33 of income tax expense arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower Federal income tax rates.
Underwriting Loss

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Underwriting loss increased in 2018 primarily due to higher current accident year catastrophe losses, higher underwriting expenses and the effect of lower earned premium, partially offset by lower current accident year loss ratios before catastrophes in both auto and homeowners and lower amortization of DAC. The increase in underwriting expenses was largely driven by an increase in direct marketing spending, selling expenses, and operational costs to generate new business.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Underwriting loss decreased in 2017 primarily due to a change from unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016 to favorable development in 2017 and lower current accident year loss costs in both auto and homeowners, partially offset by higher current accident year catastrophe losses. The decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily due to lower marketing and operations costs, partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation and the decrease in DAC amortization was driven primarily by lower Agency commissions.
Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Earned premiums decreased in 2018, reflecting a decline in written premium over the prior six to twelve months in both Agency channels and, to a lesser extent, in AARP Direct.
Written premiums decreased in 2018 in AARP Direct and both Agency channels. Despite an increase in new business and stable policy count retention in both auto and homeowners, written premium declined primarily due to not generating enough new business to offset the loss of non-renewed premium.
Renewal written pricing increases in 2018 were higher in homeowners driven by actions taken to improve profitability and were lower in automobile as loss cost trends have moderated and the Company has sought to increase new business.
Policy count retention increased in automobile as renewal written price increases decreased. Policy count

71

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

retention in homeowners was flat despite higher renewal written price increases.
Policies in-force decreased in 2018 in both automobile and homeowners, driven by not generating enough new business to offset the loss of non-renewed policies.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Earned premiums decreased in 2017, reflecting a decline in written premium over the prior six to twelve months in the Other Agency channel and, to a lesser extent, in AARP Direct.
Written premiums decreased in 2017 in AARP Direct and both Agency channels primarily due to a decline in new business and lower policy count retention in both automobile and homeowners partially offset by the effect of renewal written price increases.
Renewal written pricing increases were higher in 2017 in both automobile and home, as the Company increased rates to improve profitability.
Policy count retention decreased in 2017 in both automobile and homeowners, driven in part by renewal written pricing increases.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio before Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased in 2018, primarily due to the effect of earned pricing increases in both automobile and homeowners and lower non-catastrophe weather-related homeowners loss costs.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased in 2017, primarily as a result of lower automobile liability and auto physical damage frequency and lower non-catastrophe weather-related homeowners losses and the effect of earned pricing increases.
Current Accident Year Catastrophes and Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Accident Year Development

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2018 were primarily from wildfires in California, wind and hail storms in Colorado, hurricanes Florence and Michael in the Southeast and various wind storms and winter storms across the country. Catastrophe losses in 2018 are net of an estimated

72

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

reinsurance recoverable of $54 under the 2018 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty that was allocated to Personal Lines. Catastrophe losses for 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma and wildfires in California as well as multiple wind and hail events across various U.S. geographic regions, concentrated in Texas, Colorado, the Midwest and the Southeast.
Prior accident year development was less favorable in 2018 than in 2017 with favorable development in 2018 primarily in automobile liability.

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Current accident year catastrophe losses for 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma and wildfires in California as well as multiple wind and hail events across various U.S. geographic regions, concentrated in Texas, Colorado, the Midwest and the Southeast. Catastrophe losses for 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various U.S. geographic regions, concentrated in the Midwest and central plains.
Prior accident year development was favorable for 2017 compared to unfavorable prior accident year development for 2016. Net reserves decreased in 2017 primarily due to decreases in reserves for prior accident year catastrophes and homeowners.

Net Income (Loss)

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income decreased from 2017 to 2018, primarily due to greater adverse reserve development in 2018 related to unallocated loss adjustment expenses, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and certain mass torts. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net investment income driven by the decline in invested assets associated with this run-off business.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net loss improved from a loss of $529 to net income of $69 primarily due to ceded premium of $423 after tax incurred in 2016 for an Adverse Reserve Development ("ADC") reinsurance cover on asbestos and environmental reserves after 2016. (For further discussion on the ADC, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property and Casualty Other Operations). Prior accident year asbestos and environmental losses in 2016 before execution of the ADC also contributed to the year over year improvement.

Pre-tax Charge for Asbestos and Environmental Reserve Increases

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Asbestos Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2018 as a $167 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $167 of losses recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to a higher than previously expected number of mesothelioma claim filings, an increase in the average settlement value of mesothelioma claims, an increase in defense costs, and the Company assuming a greater share of liability due to unfavorable interpretations of coverage. An increase in reserves from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years contributed to the adverse development.
Environmental Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2018 as a $71 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $71 of loss recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with Superfund sites and sediment in waterways, increased defense costs and adverse legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Asbestos Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2017 as a $183 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $183 of losses recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to mesothelioma claim filings not declining as expected, unfavorable developments in coverage law in some jurisdictions and continued filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. An increased share of adverse development from the fourth quarter review is from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years.
Environmental Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2017 as a $102 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $102 of loss recoverable under the NICO treaty. The

74

increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with Superfund sites and sediment in waterways, as well as adverse

legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.

2019 Outlook
The Company expects Group Benefits fully insured ongoing premiums to be relatively flat in 2019, driven by an expected decrease in sales, partly due to the introduction of the New York Paid Family Leave product in 2018, offset by strong persistency. In 2019, the segment's net income margin is expected to be between 5.5% and 6.5%, compared to a net income margin of 5.6% in 2018. The expected increase largely reflects net realized capital losses and higher integration costs associated with the acquired business in 2018. Management expects that the 2019 core earnings margin, which does not include the effect of net realized capital gains (losses) or integration costs associated with the acquired business, will be in the range of 6.0% to 7.0%, down from prior year as strong investment returns from limited partnerships in 2018 are not assumed to repeat in 2019. The total loss ratio and expense ratio are expected to be consistent with 2018.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher premiums and other considerations and higher net investment income, including from the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, a lower loss ratio, and the benefit of a lower corporate income tax rate, partially offset by higher insurance operating costs and other expenses, including integration costs, and amortization of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition, and a change to net realized capital losses. The benefit of the lower corporate income tax rate was largely offset by a $52 tax benefit in 2017 that was primarily due to reducing net deferred tax liabilities given the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased 40% primarily due to the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, including integration costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by state guaranty fund assessments of $20 before tax related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company in 2017. Integration costs were $47 in 2018 compared to $17 in 2017.

Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to $52 of income tax benefits arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities due to the enactment of lower Federal income tax rates. In addition, net income increased as a result of growth in premiums and other considerations and a lower group disability loss ratio, partially offset by an increase in insurance operating costs and other expenses due, in part, to higher variable incentive compensation as well as integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. Insurance operating costs and other expenses in 2017 also included state guaranty fund assessments of $20 before tax related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company. The acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, which closed on November 1, 2017, did not have a material impact on results in 2017.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased 18%, primarily due to the inclusion of two months of expenses for the acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, state guaranty fund assessments of $20 before tax related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company and an increase in variable incentive compensation.
Fully Insured Ongoing Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Fully insured ongoing premiums increased 52% in 2018 driven primarily by the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, sales in excess of cancellations with strong group life and disability persistency, and premium from the New York Paid Family Leave product.
Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts increased 57% primarily due to new business generated by our larger combined sales force following the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. The

76

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Company also saw an increase in the sale of voluntary products and sales of fully insured disability in 2018 due, in part, to the addition of the New York Paid Family Leave product.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Fully insured ongoing premiums increased in 2017, in part, because it included two months of premiums for the acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, fully insured ongoing premiums increased 3% due to sales, strong persistency and modest group disability pricing increases.
Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts were essentially flat to prior year reflecting higher group disability sales offset by lower group life and other sales.
Ratios

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Total loss ratio decreased 0.8 points from 2017 to 2018 as a decrease in the group disability loss ratio was partially offset by an increase in the group life loss ratio. The group disability loss ratio decreased 3.4 points driven by continued favorable incidence trends, including favorable prior incurral year development of approximately $230 with most of that development from the 2017 incurral year as incidence trends become known after the elimination period is satisfied. In addition, the group disability loss ratio benefited from the lower discount accretion associated with the disability business acquired from Aetna.
The group life loss ratio increased 1.7 points primarily driven by higher expected loss ratios associated with the group life business acquired from Aetna. Group life business (including group life premium waiver) included favorable prior incurral year development of approximately $90 in 2018, mostly from the 2017 incurral year.
Expense ratio decreased 1.7 points due to a greater mix of lower commission national accounts business due to the acquisition of Aetna's group life and disability business, higher revenues to cover fixed costs and the effect of state guaranty assessments in 2017 related to the liquidation of a life and health

insurance company, partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization incurred in 2018.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Total loss ratio decreased 1.9 points, primarily due to a lower group disability loss ratio. The group disability loss ratio decreased 4.9 points, driven by continued improvements in incidence trends, higher recoveries and modest pricing increases. The group life loss ratio increased 1.0 points, primarily driven by favorable changes in reserve estimates of 1.3 points in 2016 partially offset by favorable mortality in the current year.
Expense ratio increased 0.6 points primarily due to state guaranty fund assessments related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company, an increase in variable incentive compensation and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. Integration and transaction costs of $17 in 2017 related to the acquisition are not included in the expense ratio.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

2019 Outlook
Due in large part to the effect of the decline in markets on assets under management since October 2018, the Company expects net income for Hartford Funds to be relatively flat from 2018 to 2019, provided the Company continues to deliver strong fund performance and generates positive net flows. The Company expects to increase net sales in 2019 from a diversified lineup of mutual funds and ETPs, though net flows are more uncertain given the increased volatility in the markets. Assuming the Company can generate positive net flows and fund performance is strong, assets under management are expected to increase modestly despite the continued decline of the Talcott Resolution AUM.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income increased in 2018 due to higher investment management fees driven by higher average daily assets under management, partially offset by higher variable costs. Also contributing to the increase was the effect of a lower corporate Federal income tax rate.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net income increased in 2017 due to higher investment management fees resulting from higher daily average AUM levels driven in part by the addition of Schroders' funds in late 2016, as well as a reduction in estimated state income tax expense, partially offset by higher variable costs including sub-advisory and distribution and service expenses.

Hartford Funds AUM

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Hartford Funds AUM decreased from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 largely due to a decline in markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the continued expected decline of the Talcott Resolution AUM still managed by the Company. Despite the decline in AUM in the fourth quarter of 2018, average daily assets under management for the year were up 9% due to market appreciation and net positive flows during the first 9 months of 2018.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Hartford Funds AUM increased in 2017 primarily due to positive net flows and market appreciation, partially offset by the continued expected decline of the Talcott Resolution AUM still managed by the Company.

Net Income (Loss)

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income compared to a net loss in 2017, primarily due to a number of charges in 2017, including a $3.3 billion after tax loss on the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, $867 of income tax expense primarily from reducing net deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the corporate Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and the effect of a pension settlement charge of

$488, after tax. The settlement charge in 2017 related to the purchase of a group annuity contract to transfer $1.6 billion of certain U.S. qualified pension plan liabilities to a third party. Apart from the effect of these charges in 2017, an increase in fee income from managing Talcott Resolution invested assets post-sale and lower interest expense, as well as higher net investment income and lower benefits and losses incurred related to run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities was partially offset by higher investment management expenses and a lower tax benefit due to the reduction in the corporate Federal income tax rate. Other revenue in 2018 from providing transition services to Talcott Resolution was offset by the cost of providing those services.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased in 2018 largely due to costs incurred to manage the invested assets of Talcott Resolution post-sale, partially offset by a reduction in centralized services costs previously allocated to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations increased from loss of $2,869 in 2017 to income of $322 in 2018 with the net loss in 2017 due to a loss on sale of the Company’s life and annuity business of $3.3 billion in 2017. A $202 reduction in loss on sale in 2018 was largely offset by a decline in operating income from the life and annuity business sold in May 2018. The reduction in loss on sale was largely attributable to an increase in

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

the estimated retained net operating loss carryover tax benefits from the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 as well as the reclassification to retained earnings of $193 of tax effects stranded in AOCI due to the accounting for Tax Reform. For more information on the reclassification of stranded tax effects, see Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net loss increased primarily due to a $3.3 billion estimated loss on sale of the life and annuity business, $867 of income tax expense arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower Federal income tax rates and a $488 after tax pension settlement charge.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased in 2017 largely due lower centralized services costs and lower estimated state income tax expense. Upon reporting the life and annuity business as discontinued operations, centralized services costs were reallocated to Corporate for all periods presented and those reallocated costs declined from 2016 to 2017 principally due to a lower allocation of IT costs.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations decreased from income of $283 in 2016 to a net loss of $2.9 billion in 2017 with the net loss in 2017 due to a loss on sale of the Company’s life and annuity business of $3.3 billion, partially offset by operating income from discontinued operations of $388. Operating income from discontinued operations increased from $283 in 2016 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses in 2017. Apart from the reduction in net realized capital losses, earnings were relatively flat as an increase in the assumption study benefit and lower interest credited were largely offset by lower net investment income and lower fee income due to the continued run off of the variable annuity block.

Interest Expense

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Interest expense decreased primarily due to the redemption of junior subordinated debentures. On June 15, 2018, The Hartford redeemed $500 aggregate principal amount of its 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 and recognized a $6 loss on extinguishment of debt for unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. On March 15, 2018, the Company issued $500 of 4.4% senior notes due March 15, 2048 for net proceeds of approximately $490. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the Company's $320 of 6.3% senior notes at maturity. See Note 13 -Debt of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt due to debt maturities and the paydown of senior notes.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company’s risks.
The Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee (“ERCC”) oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. As illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC.

 ERCC

Asset Liability Committee Underwriting Risk Committee Emerging Risk Steering Committee Operational Risk Committee Catastrophe Risk Steering Committee Economic Capital Executive Committee Model Oversight Committee

The Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:

- -----------------------------------
• risk identification and assessment;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;

- --------------------
• risk monitoring; and

- -------------------------------------
• internal and external risk reporting.

The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.

Insurance Risk
Insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the P&C and group benefits products the Company has sold. Catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios.
Sources of Insurance Risk Non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the Company's divisions except Hartford Funds and include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Property- Risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage and other covered perils.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Liability- Risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, losses from political and credit coverages, losses derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mortality- Risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from group life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Morbidity- Risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Disability- Risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short term or long-term disability payments.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Longevity- Risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments.

Catastrophe risk primarily arises in the property, automobile, group life, group disability, and workers' compensation product lines.
Impact Non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the Company’s earnings. Catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the Company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity.
Management The Company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. The Company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses.
In addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell.  The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids.
Among specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.

Risk Definition Details and Company Limits
Natural catastrophe Exposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios and the inherent volatility of weather or climate pattern changes. The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property & casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. From time to time the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus.
 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events is estimated to be $917 before reinsurance and $470 net of reinsurance. [1]
 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.6 billion before reinsurance and $877 net of reinsurance. [1]
Terrorism The risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons (“NBCR”). Enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. The Company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $2.0 billion net of reinsurance and $2.5 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program established under “TRIPRA”. In addition, the Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. Our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.
Pandemic The exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios. The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 18% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty and group benefits insurance subsidiaries. In evaluating these scenarios, the Company assesses the impact on group life policies, short-term and long-term disability, property & casualty claims, and losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. While ERM has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. The estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates that have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. The net loss estimates provided assume that the Company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. The Company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.

Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy
In addition to the policies and procedures outlined above, the Company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk (including facultative reinsurance) or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in

place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (“TRIPRA”) and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.
Reinsurance for Catastrophes- The Company has catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover property and workers’ compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events.

Primary Catastrophe Treaty Reinsurance Coverages as of January 1, 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------

 Portion of losses reinsured Portion of losses retained by The Hartford
Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty for 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019 [1]
Losses of $0 to $350 from one event None 100% retained
Losses of $350 to $500 from one event 75% of $150 in excess of $350 25% co-participation
Losses of $500 to $1.1 billion from one event [2] 90% of $600 in excess of $500 10% co-participation
Aggregate Property Catastrophe Treaty for 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019 [3]
$0 to $775 of aggregate losses None 100% retained
$775 to $1.0 billion of aggregate losses 100% None
Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty for 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2019
Losses of $0 to $100 from one event None 100% retained
Losses of $100 to $450 from one event [4] 80% of $350 in excess of $100 20% co-participation

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] In addition to the Property Occurrence Treaty, for Florida events, The Hartford has purchased the mandatory FHCF reinsurance for the period from 6/1/2018 to 5/30/2019. Retention and coverage varies by writing company. The writing company with the largest coverage under FHCF is Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, with coverage for $84 of per event losses in excess of a $29 retention.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Portions of this layer of coverage extend beyond the traditional one year term.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] The aggregate treaty is not limited to a single event; rather, it is designed to provide reinsurance protection for the aggregate of all events designated as catastrophes by PCS (Property Claims Services/Verisk) with a $350 limit on any one event.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] In addition to the limits shown, the worker's compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of $30 in per event losses in excess of a $20 retention.

In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses. The Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty and Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty include a provision to reinstate limits in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties.
Reinsurance for Terrorism- For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As such, the Company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA to the end of 2020.
TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism”, which is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $180 in 2019, with the threshold increasing to $200 by 2020. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government would pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the Company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. The percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 81% in 2019, decreasing to 80% in 2020. The Company's estimated deductible under the program is $1.3 billion for 2019. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.

Reinsurance for A&E Reserve Development- Under an ADC reinsurance agreement, NICO assumes adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s net A&E reserves recorded as of December 31, 2016. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid for the ADC are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. As of December 31, 2018, $523 of incurred asbestos and environmental losses had been ceded to NICO, leaving approximately $977 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of A&E claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. Furthermore, there is a risk that cumulative adverse development of A&E claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case all adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity.

Reinsurance Recoverables
Property and casualty insurance product reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverables from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools.

As shown in the following table, a portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverables relates to the Company’s mandatory participation in various involuntary assigned risk pools and the value of annuity contracts held under structured settlement agreements. Reinsurance recoverables due from mandatory pools are backed by the financial strength of the property and casualty insurance industry. Annuities purchased from third-party life insurers under structured settlements are recognized as reinsurance recoverables in cases where the Company has not obtained a release from the claimant. Of the remaining gross reinsurance recoverables, the portion of recoverables due from companies rated by A.M. Best is as follows:

To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. As indicated in the above table, 81.8% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by A.M. Best were rated A- (excellent) or better as of December 31, 2018.
Annually, the Company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Property & Casualty Other Operations reporting segment, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the Commercial Lines reporting segment. For a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.
Group Benefits reinsurance recoverables represent reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other policyholder funds and benefits payable that are recoverable from a number of reinsurers.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-related Assessments
As part of its risk management strategy, the Company regularly monitors the financial strength of other insurers and, in particular, activity by insurance regulators and various state guaranty associations relating to troubled insurers. In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund.

Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events.
Sources of Operational Risk Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include: compliance with laws and regulation, cybersecurity, business disruption, technology failure, inadequate execution or process management, reliance on model and data analytics, internal fraud, external fraud, third party dependency and attraction and retention of talent.

85

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Impact Operational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.
Management Responsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• Establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;

- ------------------------------------------------
• Validating existing crisis management protocols;

- ----------------------------------------------
• Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and

- ------------------------------
• Purchasing insurance coverage.

Cybersecurity Risk
The Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford has invested to build a ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the Company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.
The Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the Company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program (the "Program") commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach employs internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management. In addition, we have procedures to ensure timely notification of critical cybersecurity incidents pursuant to the Program to help identify employees who may have material non-public information and to implement blackout restrictions on trading the Company's securities during the investigation and assessment of such cybersecurity incidents.
From a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to the Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee (FIRMCo), a committee comprised of all directors, which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the Audit Committee, which oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures. The topics covered by these updates include the Company's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned

from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our cyber defenses.

Financial Risk
Financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets. Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter ("OTC") and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.
The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity and foreign currency exchange, as described below.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.
Sources of Liquidity Risk Sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.
Impact Inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.
Management The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquid assets. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of the Holding Company have been and will continue to be met by the Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit

facilities as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ("FHLBB") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.
For further discussion on liquidity see the section on Capital Resources and Liquidity.

Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk
Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.
Sources of Credit Risk The majority of the Company’s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings, but it is also present in the Company’s reinsurance and insurance portfolios.
Impact A decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment’s credit spread, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairment, and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. Premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty’s unwillingness or inability to pay.
Management The objective of the Company’s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. The Company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. Potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.
The Company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. Both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. Credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. Within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities;

- -------------------------------------------
• Selling investments subject to credit risk;

- --------------------------------------------
• Hedging through use of credit default swaps;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions

- -------------------------
• Requiring collateral; and

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.

The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Credit Risk

Investments Essentially all of the Company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. Credit related impairments on investments were $1 and $2, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. (See the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.”)

Reinsurance recoverables Reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $4,357 and $4,061, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (See the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy.”)

Premiums receivable and agents' balances Premiums receivable and agents’ balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, were $3,995 and $3,910, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (For a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section labeled “Revenue Recognition.”)

Credit Risk of Derivatives
The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades.

87

Managing the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.
The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's net fair value, including income accruals, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.
Use of Credit Derivatives
The Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.
Credit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives
The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $6 and $61, respectively, while the fair value was $0 and $1, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
Credit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives
The Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are

permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and indexes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $1.1 billion and $823, respectively, while the fair value was $3 for both periods. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
For further information on credit derivatives, see Note 7 Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Credit Risk of Business Operations
A portion of the company's commercial business is written with large deductible policies or retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contract holder for the deductible amount, and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. Additionally, retrospectively rated policies are utilized primarily for workers compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is determined based on actual loss activity. Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it does introduce credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such contract holders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the retrospectively rated policyholders failed to pay additional premiums owed. While the Company attempts to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting, credit analysis, collateral requirements, provision for bad debt, and other oversight mechanisms, the Company’s efforts may not be successful.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.
Sources of Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities, long-term debt obligations, short and long-term disability claim reserves, and discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s pension and other post retirement benefit obligations.
Impact Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.

88

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change in Interest Rates Favorable Effects Unfavorable Effects
ñ Additional net investment income due to reinvesting at higher yields Decrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio
 Higher interest expense on variable rate debt obligations
ò Increase in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio Lower net investment income due to reinvesting at lower investment yields
 Acceleration in paydowns and prepayments or calls of certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities

Management The Company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek to protect the firm from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the liabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration.
The Company may also utilize a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. Interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flows of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $10.5 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively primarily related to investments. The fair value of these derivatives was $(61) and $(83) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Interest Rate Risk

Fixed income investments The fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $43.7 billion and $42.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 4.7 years and 5.2 years as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturities due to changes in interest rates are reflected as a component of AOCI.

Long-term debt obligations The Company's variable rate debt obligations will generally result in increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates; the inverse is true during a declining interest rate environment. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Group life and disability product liabilities The cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the Company's Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. Though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $8,445 and $8,512, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts. Changes in the value of the liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

89

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations The Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates as well as the sensitivity of the fair value of investments in the plan portfolios to changes in interest rates. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. The Company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans’ investment returns, including from investments in fixed maturities, are lower than expected. (For further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $791 and $926, respectively, of unfunded liabilities for pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recorded within Other Liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
Group Life and Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them
Included in the following table is the before tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the Company’s Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.
The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

The carrying value of assets supporting the liabilities related to the businesses included in the table above was $10.0 billion and $10.1 billion, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. The assets supporting the liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Invested Assets not Supporting Group Life and Disability Reserves
The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before tax change in the fair value of the Company’s investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting group life and disability reserves which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.

The carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $33.7 billion and $32.4 billion, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Long-term Debt
A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would result in an increase in the fair value of the liability of $331 and $340 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would result in a decrease in the fair value of the liability of $(279) and $(287) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will not impact the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plan Obligations
A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would impact both the value of the underlying pension assets and the value of the liability, resulting in an increase in the net pension and other post-retirement plan obligations liability of $178 and $226 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would have the inverse effect and result in a decrease in the net pension and other post-retirement plan obligations liability of $(134) and $(170) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Gains or losses due to changes in interest rates on the pension and post-retirement plan obligations are recorded within AOCI and are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold.

Equity Risk
Equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices.
Sources of Equity Risk The Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds assets under management.
Impact The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities, alternative assets and limited partnerships which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. For assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact.
Management The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and hedging of changes in equity indices.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Equity Risk

Investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and certain alternative assets and limited partnerships. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of these types of investments and could negatively impact the Company’s earnings while increases in equity will have the inverse impact. For equity securities, the changes in fair value are reported in net realized capital gains and losses. For alternative assets and limited partnerships, the Company's share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.

Assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.
The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize the risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options. Declines in value are recognized as unrealized losses in AOCI. Increases in equity markets are recognized as unrealized gains in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 18 Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets under management in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.

Equity Sensitivity
Investment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
Included in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the movement in economic value is calculated using a beta analysis largely derived from historical experience relative to the S&P 500.
The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration to the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. These calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations or significant product sales.

Hartford Funds assets under management
Hartford Funds earnings are significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported earnings for that one year period is $(37) as of December 31, 2018. The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration to the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.
Sources of Currency Risk The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments and foreign denominated cash.
Impact Changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities.
Based on the fair values of the Company’s non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a before tax total of $9 and $10, respectively. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.
Management The open foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. In order to manage the currency risk related to any non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, the Company holds non-U.S. dollar denominated investments which match the underlying currency exposure of the liabilities.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities, and cash The fair values of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash, excluding assets held for sale, at December 31, 2018

and 2017 were approximately $178 and $298, respectively. Included in these amounts are $119 and $128 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. The currency risk of the remaining non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps.

Investment in a P&C run-off entity in the United Kingdom During 2015, the Company entered into certain foreign currency forwards to hedge the currency impacts on changes in equity of a P&C run-off entity in the United Kingdom that was sold during 2017. At December 31, 2016, the derivatives used to hedge the currency impacts had a total notional amount of $200, and a total fair value of $(2), respectively. The Company terminated these hedges in 2017.

Financial Risk on Statutory Capital
Statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin.

Most of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of

our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

Investment Portfolio Risk
The following table presents the Company’s fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this

section are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.

European Exposure
While the European economy is still growing, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 growth forecasts for the region, citing the prospect for a more turbulent external environment, including escalating trade tensions and slowing global demand. Political risk will likely remain elevated in Europe during 2019 due to uncertainty surrounding Great Britain's pending departure from the European Union ("Brexit"), increasing pressure on centrist governments in France and Germany and ongoing concern over Italian fiscal policy.  The Company manages the credit risk associated with its European securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis. For additional details regarding the Company’s management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk section of this MD&A.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s European investment exposure had both an amortized cost and fair value of $2.5 billion, or 5% of total invested assets; as of December 31, 2017, amortized cost and fair value totaled $1.9 billion and $2 billion,

respectively. The investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. As of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average credit quality of European investments was A-. Entities domiciled in the United Kingdom comprise the Company's largest European exposure; as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the U.K. exposure totals less than 2% of total invested assets and largely relates to the industrial and financial services sector and has an average credit rating of BBB+. The majority of the European investments are U.S. dollar-denominated, and those securities that are British pound or euro-denominated are hedged to U.S. dollars. For a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of this MD&A.

[1]Includes securities with pools of loans issued by the Small Business Administration which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

The Company also has exposure to commercial mortgage loans. These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans and are participated out to third parties. Loan participations are loans where the Company has purchased or retained a portion of an outstanding loan or package of loans and participates on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement.
As of December 31, 2018, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost and carrying value of $3.7 billion, with a valuation allowance of $1. As of December 31, 2017, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost and carrying value of $3.2 billion with a valuation allowance of $1.

The Company funded $664 of commercial whole loans with a weighted average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 59% and a weighted average yield of 4.4% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The Company continues to originate commercial loans within primary markets, such as office, industrial and multi-family, focusing on loans with strong LTV ratios and high quality property collateral. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.

[2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.

As of both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, the New York Dormitory Authority, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. In total, municipal bonds make up 22% of the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio. The Company has evaluated its portfolio allocation to municipal bonds with respect to the changes in corporate income tax rates that began in 2018 and has reduced exposure through both asset sales and principal repayments. The Company will continue to actively assess the sector’s relative value over time.

Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments
The following table presents the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds and private equity funds. Real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, equity funds. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.

Available-for-sale Securities — Unrealized Loss Aging
The total gross unrealized losses were $654 as of December 31, 2018, and have increased $524 from December 31, 2017, due to widening of credit spreads and higher interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, $631 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $23 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily related to one corporate issuer with declining credit fundamentals and commercial real estate securities that were purchased at tighter credit spreads.

As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For further information regarding the Company’s impairment analysis, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of this MD&A.

Company from its insurance subsidiaries, see "Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries" below. For a discussion of potential limitations on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1A, — Risk Factors for the risk factor "Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations".

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) and Internal Revenue Code regulations. The Company made contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $101, $280 and $300 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company’s 2018, 2017 and 2016 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. The Company does not have a 2019 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2019. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2019 to make this determination.
Beginning in 2017, the Company began to use a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change was made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
This change did not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. The change resulted in a reduction of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for 2017 of $32 before tax. The discount rate used to measure interest cost during 2017 was 3.58% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.37% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 3.55% for the non-qualified pension plan, and 3.13% for the postretirement benefit plan. Under the Company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost component would have been 4.22% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.92% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 4.19% for the non-qualified pension plan and 3.97% for the postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and

accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.
On June 30, 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.6 billion of the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants, and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 after tax) and a reduction to stockholders' equity of $144.
In connection with this transaction, the Company made a contribution of $280 in September 2017 to the U.S. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan’s pre-transaction funded status.

Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries
Dividends to the HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
Total dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG holding company in 2018 were $3.1 billion. This includes extraordinary dividends of $3.0 billion comprised of a $1.9 billion principal paydown on the intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, $226 related to interest payments on the note and $900 to fund near-term obligations of the HFSG holding company. In addition, there was $50 of ordinary P&C dividends that were paid to HFSG holding company, and $110 of capital contributed by the HFSG holding company to a run-off P&C subsidiary. Excluding the interest payments on the intercompany note and dividends that were subsequently contributed to a P&C subsidiary, net dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG holding company were $2.8 billion during 2018.
Total net dividends received by HFSG holding company in 2018 were $2.9 billion, including the $2.8 billion from P&C subsidiaries and $119 from Hartford Funds during the year. There were no dividends received from Hartford Life and Accident in 2018.

2019 Dividend Capacity

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• P&C - Under the formula described above, the Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.2 billion in dividends to HFSG Holding Company for 2019 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner, though only $200 of this dividend capacity could be paid before the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2019, HFSG Holding Company does not anticipate receiving net dividends from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, as planned 2019 dividends were received in the fourth quarter 2018. The HFSG Holding Company generally expects to receive net dividends of $850 to $900 a year from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries subject to the profitability of those subsidiaries and their capital needs.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Benefits - Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA") has $380 dividend capacity for 2019, and anticipates paying $250 to $300 dividends in 2019.

Other Sources of Capital for the HFSG Holding Company
The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "Ratings" section below for further discussion), and stockholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of debt, common equity, preferred stock, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of stockholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.
Shelf Registrations
The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC") on July 29, 2016 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement.
Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper
Revolving Credit Facilities
On March 29, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to its Five-Year Credit Agreement dated October 31, 2014. The Amendment reset the level of the Company's minimum consolidated net worth financial covenant to $9 billion, excluding AOCI, from its former $13.5 billion (where net worth was defined as stockholders' equity excluding AOCI and including junior subordinated debt), among other updates. Among other changes, under an amended and restated credit agreement that became effective in June 2018, after the closing of the sale of the Company's life and annuity business, the aggregate amount of principal of the credit facility decreased from $1 billion to $750, including a reduction to the amount available for letters of credit from $250 to $100, the maturity date was extended to March 29, 2023, and the liens covenant and certain other covenants were modified.
As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding and $3 in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and

the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
For further information regarding revolving credit facilities, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commercial Paper
The Hartford’s maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $750. As of December 31, 2018 there was no commercial paper outstanding.
For further information regarding commercial paper, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Intercompany Liquidity Agreements
The Company has $2.0 billion available under an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ("CTDOI") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes.
As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding at the HFSG Holding Company.
Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
In August 2018, the Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLA”), became members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short or long-term with fixed or variable rates.
As of December 31, 2018, there were no advances outstanding under either FHLBB facility.
For further information regarding collateralized advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2018 was $76. For this $76, the legal entities have posted collateral of $71, in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2018, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength rates

102

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2018, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $7 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.
As of December 31, 2018, no derivative positions would be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.

Insurance Operations
While subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the Company’s insurance operations’ current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.
The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company.
The Company’s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as “Property & Casualty Operations”) and Group Benefits.
The Company's insurance operations hold fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs. Liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by the Company's insurance operations' short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating

funds, including premiums or investing cash flows, which includes proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized capital losses.
The following tables represent the fixed maturity holdings, including the aforementioned cash and short-term investments necessary to meet liquidity needs, for each of the Company’s insurance operations.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations (gross of reinsurance) under property and casualty contracts:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include IBNR and case reserves. While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. In addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. As of December 31, 2018, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $388.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amounts shown do not consider $4.2 billion of reinsurance and other recoverables the Company expects to collect related to property and casualty obligations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Estimated group life and disability obligations are based on assumptions comparable with the Company’s historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. As of December 31, 2018, the total group life and disability obligations in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $1.5 billion.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on lease commitments.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] Includes contractual principal and interest payments. See Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] Includes $954 in commitments to purchase investments including approximately $707 of limited partnership and other alternative investments, $163 of private debt and equity securities, and $84 of mortgage loans. Of the $954 in commitments to purchase investments, $48 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally. Outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. The remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also included in purchase obligations is $688 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6] Includes cash collateral of $9 which the Company has accepted in connection with the Company’s derivative instruments. Since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year. Also included in other long-term liabilities are net unrecognized tax benefits of $14.

Capitalization

Capital Structure
 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Change
Short-term debt (includes current maturities of long-term debt) $ 413 $ 320 29 %
Long-term debt 4,265 4,678 (9 %)
Total debt 4,678 4,998 (6 %)
Common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI 14,346 12,831 12 %

Total stockholders' equity decreased in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in AOCI, partially offset by net income in excess of stockholder dividends and the issuance of preferred stock in 2018. AOCI decreased mainly due to the removal of AOCI

related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, as well as due to lower net unrealized capital gains on fixed maturities. Total capitalization decreased $713, or 4%, as of December 31,

[1] Cash activities include cash flows from Discontinued Operations; see Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on cash flows from Discontinued Operations.

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2018 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the effect of a $650 payment in 2017 for the ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO and the effect of an increase in premium and fee income received, partially offset by an increase in payments for benefits, losses, and loss adjustment expenses as well as operating expenses that were mostly driven by the acquisition of the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business.
Cash used for investing activities increased in 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to payments for short term investments and an increase in net payments for equity securities and mortgage loans, partially offset by proceeds from the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 and an increase in net proceeds from available for sale securities.
Cash used for financing activities increased from the 2017 period primarily due to a change to a decrease in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, as well as an increase in debt repayments in 2018, partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock acquired, proceeds raised from preferred stock issued net of issuance costs and a decline in separate account activity.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to the prior year due, in part, to an increase in fee income received, a decrease in taxes paid and a decrease in Property & Casualty claim payments, largely offset by the $650 ceded premium paid to NICO for the asbestos and environmental adverse development cover entered into in 2016.
Cash used for investing activities in 2017 primarily relates to the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business for $1.4 billion (net of cash acquired), net of $222 of net proceeds from the sale of the Company's P&C U.K. run-off business. Cash provided by investing activities in 2016 primarily related to net proceeds from available-for-sale securities of $2.7 billion, partially offset by net payments for short-term investments of $1.4 billion.
Cash used for financing activities in 2017 consists primarily of net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investments and universal life products of $991, the

repurchase of common shares outstanding and the payment of common stock dividends, offset by an increase in cash from securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase securities and issuance of debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2016 consisted primarily of repurchases of common shares outstanding of $1.3 billion, net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investments and universal life products of $782 and repayment of debt of $275.

Equity Markets

Ratings
Ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the Company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings are downgraded, the Company’s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted.

Accordingly, neither the $1.9 billion principal paydown of the note nor an associated $1.9 billion of dividends to the holding company during the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected in this table.

Stat to GAAP Differences
Significant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholders’ equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. STAT excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under U.S. STAT.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The assumptions used in the determination of Group Benefits reserves (i.e. for Group Benefits contracts) are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company’s best estimates.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while U.S. STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. STAT for life insurance companies like HLA establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.

In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.

Risk-Based Capital
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Sensitivity
In any particular year, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors and the potential impacts to the life insurance subsidiaries, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.

106

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Statutory capital at the property and casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or above the capital level required to meet “AA level” ratings from rating agencies. Statutory capital generated by the property and casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet “AA level” ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting property and casualty results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford’s legal proceedings, please see the information contained under “Litigation” and “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act") It is unclear whether the Administration, Congress or the courts will seek to reverse, amend or alter the ongoing operation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"). If such actions were to occur, they may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. It is unclear what an amended ACA would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the ACA. The impact to The Hartford as an employer would be consistent with other large employers. The Hartford’s core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the Company’s workers’ compensation business or group benefits business from the enactment of the ACA. We will continue to monitor the impact of the ACA and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the Company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.
Tax Reform At the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. We continue to analyze Tax Reform for other potential impacts. The U.S. Treasury and IRS are developing guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to Tax Reform, please see the risk factor entitled "Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial

condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "Risk Factors" in Part I.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2018.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm
The Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table provides information as of December 31, 2018 about the securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans. The Company maintains The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2010 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2014 Stock Plan") (collectively the "Stock Plans") and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). On May 21, 2014, the stockholders of

the Company approved the 2014 Stock Plan, which superseded the earlier plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2014 Stock Plan, no additional shares may be issued from the 2010 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and the 2010 Stock Plan are forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expire unexercised or are settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number of shares subject to the award, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the 2014 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2014 Stock Plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded products to individual and business customers in the United States (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).
On August 22, 2018, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of The Navigators Group, Inc. ("Navigators Group"), a global specialty underwriter, for $70 a share, or $2.1 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in late March or April 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.
On May 31, 2018, Hartford Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the issued and outstanding equity of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), a holding company, for its life and annuity operating subsidiaries.
On November 1, 2017, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction.
On May 10, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its United Kingdom ("U.K.") property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
On July 29, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Northern Homelands Company, the holding company of Maxum Specialty Insurance Group (collectively "Maxum"). On July 29, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice").
For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 2 - Business Acquisitions and Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates that are not held for sale have been eliminated.

Discontinued Operations
The results of operations of a component of the Company are reported in discontinued operations when certain criteria are met as of the date of disposal, or earlier if classified as held-for-sale. When a component is identified for discontinued operations reporting, amounts for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations. Components are identified as discontinued operations if they are a major part of an entity's operations and financial results such as a separate major line of business or a separate major geographical area of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. In particular:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Distribution costs within the Hartford Funds segment that were previously netted against fee income are presented gross in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Refer to the "Revenue Recognition" passage within the "Adoption of New Accounting Standards" section below for further information.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Stock Compensation
On January 1, 2017 the Company adopted new stock compensation guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") on a prospective basis. The updated guidance requires the excess tax benefit or tax deficiency on vesting or settlement of stock-based awards to be recognized in earnings as an income tax benefit or expense, respectively, instead of as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The new guidance also requires the related cash flows to be presented in operating activities instead of in financing activities. The amount of excess tax benefit or tax deficiency realized on vesting or

F-8

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

settlement of awards depends upon the difference between the market value of awards at vesting or settlement and the grant date fair value recognized through compensation expense. The excess tax benefit or tax deficiency is a discrete item in the reporting period in which it occurs and is not considered in determining the annual estimated effective tax rate for interim reporting. The excess tax benefit recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $5 and $15, respectively, and the excess tax benefit recognized in additional paid-in capital for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.
Reclassification of Effect of Tax Rate Change from AOCI to Retained Earnings
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the FASB's new guidance for the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform") enacted on December 22, 2017. Tax Reform reduced the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred tax balances from 35% to 21% on enactment. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company recorded the total effect of the change in enacted tax rates on deferred tax balances as a charge to income tax expense within net income during the fourth quarter of 2017, including the change in deferred tax balances related to components of AOCI. The new accounting guidance permitted the Company to reclassify the “stranded” tax effects out of AOCI and into retained earnings that resulted from recording the tax effects of unrealized investment gains, unrecognized actuarial losses on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and cumulative translation adjustments at a 35% tax rate because the 14 point reduction in tax rate was recognized in net income instead of other comprehensive income. On adoption, the Company recorded a reclassification of $88 from AOCI to retained earnings. As a result of the reclassification, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reduced the estimated loss on sale recorded in income from discontinued operations by $193, net of tax, for the increase in AOCI related to the assets held for sale. The reduction in the loss on sale resulted in a corresponding increase in assets held for sale and AOCI as of January 1, 2018 and the AOCI associated with assets held for sale was removed from the balance sheet when the sale closed on May 31, 2018. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified $105 of stranded tax effects related to continuing operations which reduced AOCI and increased retained earnings.
Financial Instruments- Recognition and Measurement
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted updated guidance issued by the FASB for the recognition and measurement of

financial instruments through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balances of retained earnings and AOCI. The new guidance requires investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income except for investments that are consolidated or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The new guidance also requires a deferred tax asset resulting from net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale that are recognized in AOCI to be evaluated for recoverability in combination with the Company’s other deferred tax assets. Under prior guidance, the Company reported equity securities, available-for-sale ("AFS"), at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. As of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings net unrealized gains of $83, after tax, related to equity securities having a fair value of $1.0 billion. In addition, $10 of net unrealized gains net of shadow DAC related to discontinued operations were reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings of the life and annuity business held for sale, which increased the estimated loss on sale in 2018 by the same amount. Beginning in 2018, the Company reports equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, which excludes insurance contracts and financial instruments. Revenue subject to the guidance is recognized when, or as, goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity is expected to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For all but certain revenues associated with our Hartford Funds business, the updated guidance is consistent with previous guidance for the Company’s transactions and did not have an effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or net income. The updated guidance also updated criteria for determining when the Company acts as a principal or an agent. The Company determined that it is the principal for some of its mutual fund distribution service contracts and, upon adoption, reclassified distribution costs of $188 and $184 for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, that were previously netted against fee income to insurance operating costs and other expenses.
Information about the nature, amount, timing of recognition and cash flows for the Company’s revenues subject to the updated guidance follows.

Total revenues subject to updated guidance $ 1,418 $ 1,253 $ 1,127

Installment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.
Insurance servicing revenues within Personal Lines consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized over the period of the flood program's policy terms.
Group Benefits products earn fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.
Hartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded products. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded products, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and collected monthly. Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded products, and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Hartford Funds other fees primarily include transfer agent fees, generally assessed as a charge per account, and are recognized as fee income in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.
Corporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets, including management of the invested assets of Talcott Resolution Life, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Talcott Resolution"). Talcott Resolution is the new

holding company of the life and annuity business the Company sold in May 2018. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Corporate transition service revenues consist of operational services provided to The Hartford’s former life and annuity business that will be provided for a period up to twenty-four months from the May 31, 2018 sale date. The transition service revenues are recognized as other revenues in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.
Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Hedging Activities
The FASB issued updated guidance on hedge accounting. The updates allow hedge accounting for new types of interest rate hedges of financial instruments and simplify documentation requirements to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, any gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness will be reported in the same income statement line with the effective hedge results and the hedged transaction. For cash flow hedges, the ineffectiveness will be recognized in earnings only when the hedged transaction affects earnings; otherwise, the ineffectiveness gains or losses will remain in AOCI. Under current accounting, total hedge ineffectiveness is reported separately in realized gains and losses apart from the hedged transaction. The Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2019 through a cumulative effect adjustment of less than $1 to reclassify cumulative ineffectiveness on open cash flow hedges from retained earnings to AOCI. The adoption will not affect the Company’s financial position or cash flows or have a material effect on net income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Goodwill
The FASB issued updated guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The updated guidance requires recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit compared to its estimated fair value, with the amount of the impairment not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under existing guidance, if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. An impairment loss is then recognized for the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill compared to the implied goodwill value. The Company expects to adopt the updated guidance January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis as required, although earlier adoption is permitted. While the Company would not have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the years presented, the impact of the adoption will depend on the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units compared to the carrying value at adoption.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
The FASB issued updated guidance for recognition and measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance will replace the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for recognizing credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value, which will initially result in the recognition of greater allowances for losses. The allowance will be an estimate of credit losses expected over the life of financial instruments carried at other than fair value, such as mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and receivables. Credit losses on fixed maturities AFS carried at fair value will continue to be measured like other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI"); however, the losses will be recognized through an allowance and no longer as an adjustment to the cost basis. Recoveries of impairments on fixed maturities AFS will be recognized as reversals of valuation allowances and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The allowance on fixed maturities AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of a valuation allowance and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase. The Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the change in the allowance for credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value. No allowance will be recognized at adoption for fixed maturities AFS; rather, their cost basis will be evaluated for an allowance for credit losses prospectively. The Company has not yet determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the ultimate impact of the adoption will depend on the composition of the financial instruments and market conditions at the adoption date. Significant implementation matters yet to be addressed include estimating lifetime expected losses on financial instruments carried at other than fair value, determining the impact of valuation allowances on net investment income from fixed maturities AFS, and updating our investment accounting system functionality to maintain

adjustable valuation allowances on fixed maturities AFS, subject to a fair value floor.
Leases
The FASB issued updated guidance on lease accounting. Under the new guidance, effective January 1, 2019, lessees with operating leases are required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Under guidance effective through December 31, 2018, future minimum lease payments on operating leases are commitments that are not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, leases will be classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease will be a financing lease and the Company will recognize amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease will be an operating lease and the lease costs will be recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less will also be expensed over the lease term but will not be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company will adopt the guidance as of the January 1, 2019, effective date with no change to comparative periods and record a lease payment obligation of approximately $160 for outstanding leases and a right of use asset of approximately $150, which is net of $10 in lease incentives received. The Hartford will elect to apply the package of practical expedients and not reassess expired or existing contracts that are or contain leases; all operating leases will remain classified as operating leases on adoption; and initial direct costs on existing leases will not be reassessed to determine if deferred costs should be written-off or recorded on adoption. The adoption will not impact net income or cash flows.
Reserve for Future Policy Benefits
The FASB issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. The Company’s long-duration insurance contracts include paid-up life insurance and whole-life insurance policies resulting from conversion from group life policies and run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities with total future policy benefit reserves of $642 as of December 31, 2018. Under existing guidance, a reserve for future policy benefits is calculated as the present value of future benefits and related expenses less the present value of any future premiums using assumptions “locked in” at the time the policies were issued, including discount rate, lapse rate, mortality, and expense assumptions. Under existing guidance, assumptions are only updated if there is an expected premium deficiency. The new guidance will require that underlying cash flow assumptions (such as for lapse rate, mortality and expenses) be reviewed and updated at least annually in the same quarter each year. The new guidance also requires that the discount rate assumption be updated each quarter and be based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yield. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating cash flow assumptions will be recognized in net income. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating the discount rate assumption will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Because reserves will be based on updated assumptions and no longer locked in at contract inception, there will no longer be a test for premium deficiency. The new guidance will be effective January 1, 2021,

and will be applied to balances in place as of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method or timing for adoption or estimated the effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The Company charges off any balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $135 and $132 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
Revenue from non-insurance contracts with customers is discussed above in "Adoption of New Accounting Standards, Revenue Recognition."
Dividends to Policyholders
Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.
Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 10%, 10% and 9% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $23, $35 and $15 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.
Investments
Overview
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments are classified as available-for-sale ("AFS") and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO, generally certain securities that contain embedded credit

derivatives, and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay and hedge funds on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of investments of consolidated investment funds and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value. The Company has provided seed money for investment funds and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses
Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in fixed maturities, FVO, equity securities, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes as well as ineffectiveness on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances are recognized as net realized capital losses in accordance with the Company’s impairment and mortgage loan valuation allowance policies as discussed in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency transaction remeasurements are also included in net realized capital gains and losses.
Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments are impaired and for certain other asset-backed securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For impaired debt securities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the security by prospectively adjusting the security’s yield, if necessary. The Company’s non-income

Derivative Instruments
Overview
The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility;

- --------------------
• to manage liquidity;

- -----------------------------
• to control transaction costs;

- -------------------------------------------------
• to enter into synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the derivative collateral arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized capital gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance departments.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships are measured each reporting period using the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method”, the “Change in Fair Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”, or the “Dollar Offset Method”.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is no longer adjusted through current period earnings and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item through the applicable earnings component associated with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded

derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.
Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions.

F-14

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and concentrations of credit risk. Reinsurance is placed with reinsurers that meet strict financial criteria established by the Company.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") represent costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts.
For property and casualty insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated include small commercial within the Commercial Lines segment, Group Benefits, Personal Lines and Hartford Funds. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of

the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.
Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. If the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment, which includes capitalized software, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with the decrease due to the removal of fully depreciated assets in 2018. Depreciation expense was $232, $197, and $186 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

implicitly considered in the reserving process. A number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reporting segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for run-off structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.

Group life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.
For further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in realized capital gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Aetna Group Insurance
On November 1, 2017, The Hartford acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction for total consideration of $1.452 billion, comprised of cash of $1.450 billion and share-based awards of $2, and recorded provisional estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition enables the Company to increase its market share in the group life and disability industry. In 2018, The Hartford and Aetna agreed on the final assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and The Hartford

finalized its provisional estimates with a final cash settlement within the one year measurement period allowed under U.S. GAAP ("GAAP"). As a result, in the third quarter of 2018, The Hartford recorded additional assets and liabilities at fair value of $80 and $80, respectively, with no change in goodwill. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, the measurement period adjustments recorded, and the final purchase price allocation.

Asset Amount Estimated Useful Life
Value of in-force contracts $ 23 1 year
Customer relationships 590 15 years
Marketing agreement with Aetna 16 15 years
Total $ 629

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of customer relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts acquired less costs to service the related policies. The value of the marketing agreement with Aetna was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from incremental new business written during the three-year duration of the agreement, less costs to service the related contracts. The value for each of the identifiable intangible assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected premiums, persistency rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital.

Property and equipment represents an internally developed integrated absence management software acquired that was valued based on estimated replacement cost. The software is amortized over 5 years on a straight-line basis.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses acquired were recorded at estimated fair value equal to the present value of expected future unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using the net investment yield estimated as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The fair value adjustment for the risk margin is amortized over 12 years based on the payout pattern of losses and loss expenses as estimated as of the acquisition date.
The revenues and earnings of the business acquired are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Group Benefits reporting segment and were $370 and $(37) in the year of acquisition, respectively.
The $723 of goodwill recognized is largely attributable to the acquired employee workforce, expected expense synergies, economies of scale, and tax benefits not included within the value of identifiable intangibles. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's Group Benefits reporting segment.
The Company recognized $17 of acquisition related costs in the year of acquisition. These costs are included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The following table presents supplemental pro forma amounts of revenue and net income for the Company in 2016 and 2017 as though the business was acquired on January 1, 2016.

Lattice's revenues and earnings since the acquisition date are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Hartford Funds reporting segment.
In addition to the initial cash consideration, the Company is required to make future payments to the former owners of Lattice of up to $60 based upon growth in ETP AUM over four years beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration was measured at fair value at the acquisition date by projecting future ETP AUM and discounting expected payments back to the valuation date. The projected ETP AUM and risk-adjusted discount rate are significant unobservable inputs to fair value.
The goodwill recognized is attributable to the fact that the acquisition of Lattice enables the Company to offer ETPs which are expected to be a significant source of future revenue and earnings growth. Goodwill is allocated to the Hartford Funds reporting segment.
The Company recognized $1 of acquisition related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. These costs are included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

[1] For additional information, see Note 15 - Equity and Note 19 - Stock Compensation Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of assumed exercise or issuance of warrants and stock-based awards under compensation plans.
In periods where a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders or net loss available to common stockholders is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilutive shares would be antidilutive. Due to the antidilutive impact, such shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and net income (loss) available to common stockholders in such periods. As a result, for the year

ended December 31, 2017, the Company was required to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the diluted calculations, since the inclusion of 4.3 million shares for stock compensation plans and 2.5 million shares for warrants would have been antidilutive to the calculations.
Under the treasury stock method, for warrants and stock-based awards, shares are assumed to be issued and then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework inclu

des a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:

F-21

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets, or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3 Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the

Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.
The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.

Fixed Maturities, Equity Securities, Short-term Investments, and Derivatives
Valuation Techniques
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some

F-23

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, such as municipal securities and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Internal matrix pricing, which is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s financial strength and term to maturity, using an independent public security index and trade information, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The fair value process for investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company that meets at least quarterly. The purpose of the committee is to oversee the pricing policy and procedures, as well as to approve changes to valuation methodologies and pricing sources. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews.
There are also two working groups under the Valuation Committee: a Securities Fair Value Working Group (“Securities Working Group”) and a Derivatives Fair Value Working Group ("Derivatives Working Group"). The working groups, which include various investment, operations, accounting and risk

management professionals, meet monthly to review market data trends, pricing and trading statistics and results, and any proposed pricing methodology changes.
The Securities Working Group reviews prices received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The group considers trading volume, new issuance activity, market trends, new regulatory rulings and other factors to determine whether the market activity is significantly different than normal activity in an active market. A dedicated pricing unit follows up with trading and investment sector professionals and challenges prices of third-party pricing services when the estimated assumptions used differ from what the unit believes a market participant would use. If the available evidence indicates that pricing from third-party pricing services or broker quotes is based upon transactions that are stale or not from trades made in an orderly market, the Company places little, if any, weight on the third party service’s transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal process, such as a pricing matrix.
The Derivatives Working Group reviews the inputs, assumptions and methodologies used to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. A dedicated pricing team works directly with investment sector professionals to investigate the impacts of changes in the market environment on prices or valuations of derivatives. New models and any changes to current models are required to have detailed documentation and are validated to a second source. The model validation documentation and results of validation are presented to the Valuation Committee for approval.
The Company conducts other monitoring controls around securities and derivatives pricing including, but not limited to, the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of daily price changes over specific thresholds and new trade comparison to third-party pricing services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Daily comparison of OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of weekly price changes compared to published bond prices of a corporate bond index.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly reviews of price changes over thresholds, stale prices, missing prices, and zero prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly validation of prices to a second source for securities in most sectors and for certain derivatives.

In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for model risk management and provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded futures and option contracts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The tables above exclude securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

Contingent Consideration
The acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice") on July 29, 2016 requires the Company to make payments to former owners of Lattice of up to $60 contingent upon growth in exchange-traded products ("ETP") AUM over a period of four years beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETP AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout is discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 16.6%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.

The contingency period for ETP AUM growth ends July 29, 2020 and management adjusts the fair value of the contingent consideration when it revises its projection of ETP AUM for the acquired business. Before discounting to fair value, the Company has accrued consideration payable of $40 assuming ETP AUM for the acquired business grows to approximately $4 billion over the contingency period. This contingent consideration payable included $10 payable in the first quarter of 2019 given that ETP AUM reached $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset or liability. Therefore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives reported in the Level 3 rollforward may be offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities in other line items of the financial statements.

Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk primarily related to residential real estate, and these securities are included within fixed maturities, FVO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reports changes in the fair value of these securities in net realized capital gains and losses.
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the fair value of assets and liabilities using the fair value option was $22 and $41, respectively, within the residential real estate sector.
The Company also previously elected the fair value option for certain equity securities in order to align the accounting with total return swap contracts that hedged the risk associated with the investments. The swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and the change in value of both the equity securities and the total

return swaps were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. These equity securities were classified within equity securities, AFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income earned from FVO securities was recorded in net investment income and changes in fair value were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses.
For the year-ended December 31, 2018, the realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option were $(1) within the residential real estate sector. For the year-ended December 31, 2017, the income earned from FVO and the changes recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) were driven by corporate bond and equity securities of $(1) and $1, respectively. For the year-ended December 31, 2016 the realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option were $5 and $(1) within the residential real estate and foreign government sectors.

Sales of AFS securities in 2018 were primarily a result of duration and liquidity management as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions.
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
The Company will record an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) for fixed maturities if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security.
The Company will also record an OTTI for those fixed maturities for which the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For these securities, the excess of the amortized cost basis over its fair value is separated into the portion representing a credit OTTI, which is recorded in net realized capital losses, and the remaining non-credit amount, which is recorded in OCI. The credit OTTI amount is the excess of its amortized cost basis over the Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows. The non-credit amount is the excess of the best estimate of the discounted expected future cash flows over the fair value. The Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows becomes the new cost basis and accretes prospectively into net investment income over the estimated remaining life of the security.
Developing the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.
For non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, security-specific developments, industry earnings

multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure and execute asset sales.
For structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios, average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an OTTI for certain equity securities with debt-like characteristics if the Company intended to sell or it was more likely than not that the Company was required to sell the security before a recovery in value as well as for those equity securities for which the Company did not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. The Company also recorded an OTTI for equity securities where the decline in the fair value was deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Estimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to security call or prepayment provisions. Due to the potential for variability in payment speeds (i.e. prepayments or extensions), mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are not categorized by contractual maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk. The Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government

agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were the New York State Dormitory Authority, Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the New York City Transitional Finance Authority which each comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2017, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were New York City Transitional Finance Authority, New York State Dormitory Authority and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which each comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2018 were the municipal securities, CMBS and the financial services sector which comprised approximately 22%, 8% and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2017 were municipal securities, CMBS and RMBS which comprised approximately 28%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets.

[1] Effective January 1, 2018 , with the adoption of new accounting standards for financial instruments, equity securities, AFS were reclassified to equity securities at fair value and are excluded from the table above as of December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, AFS securities in an unrealized loss position consisted of 2,960 securities, primarily in the corporate and commercial real estate sectors, which were depressed primarily due to widening of credit spreads and an increase in interest rates since the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2018, 98% of these securities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The increase in unrealized losses during 2018 was primarily attributable to widening of credit spreads and higher interest rates.
Most of the securities depressed for twelve months or more relate to corporate securities and structured securities with exposure to commercial real estate. Corporate securities and commercial real estate securities were primarily depressed because current market spreads are wider and interest rates are higher than at the securities' respective purchase dates. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the securities outlined in the preceding discussion.

Mortgage Loans
Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances
Mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when management estimates that, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to identify potential credit losses. Among other factors, management reviews current and projected macroeconomic trends, such as unemployment rates and property-specific factors such as rental rates, occupancy levels, LTV ratios and debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”). In addition, the Company considers historical, current and projected delinquency rates and property values. Estimates of collectibility require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of borrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates.

F-34

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

For mortgage loans that are deemed impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. The mortgage loan's estimated fair value is most frequently the Company's share of the fair value of the collateral but may also be the Company’s share of either (a) the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or (b) the loan’s observable market price. A valuation allowance may be recorded for an individual loan or for a group of loans that have an LTV ratio of 90% or greater, a low DSCR or have other lower credit quality characteristics. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued to the extent it is deemed collectible and the borrowers continue to make payments under the original or restructured loan terms. The Company stops accruing interest income on loans when it is probable that the Company will not receive interest and principal payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company resumes accruing interest income when it determines that sufficient collateral exists to satisfy the full amount of the loan principal and interest payments and when it is probable cash will be received in the foreseeable future. Interest income on defaulted loans is recognized when received.
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 mortgage loans had an amortized cost and carrying value of $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, with a valuation allowance of $1 for both periods.
As of December 31, 2018 the carrying value of mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance was $23. There were no mortgage loans held-for-sale as of both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract.
The following table presents the activity within the Company’s valuation allowance for mortgage loans. These loans have been evaluated both individually and collectively for impairment. Loans evaluated collectively for impairment are immaterial.

The weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was 52% as of December 31, 2018, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was 61%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. The loan collateral values are updated no less than annually through reviews of the underlying properties. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the

Company held no delinquent commercial mortgages loan past due by 90 days or more.

Mortgage Servicing
The Company originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans on behalf of third parties and recognizes servicing fees income over the period that services are performed. As of December 31, 2018, under this program, the Company serviced

F-35

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal of $6.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion was serviced on behalf of third parties and $2.4 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $1.3 billion, of which $402 was serviced on behalf of third parties, $566 was retained and reported in total investments and $356 was reported in assets held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were zero as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager.
A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidated VIEs
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is limited to the total carrying value of $1 billion and $920, respectively, which are included in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $718 and $787, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.
In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLOs, CMBS and RMBS in the Available-for-Sale Securities table and

fixed maturities, FVO, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.
Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and Other Collateral Transactions
The Company enters into securities financing transactions as a way to earn additional income or manage liquidity, primarily through securities lending and repurchase agreements.
Securities Lending
Under a securities lending program, the Company lends certain fixed maturities within the corporate, foreign government/government agencies, and municipal sectors as well as equity securities to qualifying third-party borrowers in return for collateral in the form of cash or securities. For domestic and non-domestic loaned securities, respectively, borrowers provide collateral of 102% and 105% of the fair value of the securities lent at the time of the loan. Borrowers will return the securities to the Company for cash or securities collateral at maturity dates generally of 90 days or less. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default by the counterparty, and is not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The agreements are continuous and do not have stated maturity dates and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities loaned. If cash, rather than securities, is received as collateral, the cash is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income associated with securities lending transactions is reported as a component of net investment income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Repurchase Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into repurchase agreements to manage liquidity or to earn incremental income. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which one party (transferor) agrees to sell securities to another party (transferee) in return for cash (or securities), with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same securities at a specified price at a later date. These transactions have a remaining maturity of ninety days or less. Repurchase agreements include master netting provisions that provide both counterparties the right to offset claims and apply securities held by them with respect to their obligations in the event of a default. Although the Company has the contractual right to offset claims, the Company's current positions do not meet the specific conditions for net presentation.

F-36

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Under repurchase agreements, the Company transfers collateral of U.S. government and government agency securities and receives cash. For repurchase agreements, the Company obtains cash in an amount equal to at least 95% of the fair value of the securities transferred. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred when necessary and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities transferred. The cash received from the repurchase program is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for the repurchase agreements as collateralized borrowings. The securities transferred under repurchase agreements are included in fixed maturities, AFS with the obligation to repurchase those securities recorded in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company when necessary and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. The receivable for reverse repurchase agreements is included within short-term investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Collateral Transactions
The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the fair value of securities on deposit was $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company pledged collateral of $47 and $104, respectively, of U.S. government securities and government agency securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement. These amounts also include collateral related to letters of credit.
For disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Method Investments
The majority of the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, including hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds (collectively, “limited partnerships”), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. The Company's investment in Hopmeadow Holdings LP is reported in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For further discussion on Hopmeadow Holdings LP, refer to Sale of Life and Annuity Business within Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized total equity method income of $214, $168, and $137 for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Equity method income is reported in net investment income except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2018 is limited to the total carrying value of $1.5 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $741 to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2018. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management. In 2018, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded 10% of the Company’s pre-tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method. This aggregated summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of investees' assets or earnings. Aggregate total assets of the investees totaled $311 billion and $165.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of the investees totaled $187.7 billion and $47.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Aggregate net investment income of the investees totaled $773, $1.9 billion, and $844 for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Aggregate net income excluding net investment income of the investees totaled $12.3 billion, $9.8 billion and $7.7 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of, and for the period ended, December 31, 2018, the aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information.

7. DERIVATIVES

The Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate risk or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies.
Strategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Some of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities. The hedge strategies by hedge accounting designation include:
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month Libor + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts and liability payments to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:
Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to

assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. In addition, the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps, swaptions and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities in certain investment portfolios. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. The Company may at times enter into foreign currency forwards to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash and, previously, equity securities. The Company previously entered into foreign currency forwards to hedge currency impacts on changes in equity of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries that were sold in May 2017. For further information on the disposition, see Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Index Options
The Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company also enters into call options on equity securities to generate additional return. The Company previously entered into total return swaps to hedge equity risk of specific common stock investments which were accounted for using fair value option in order to align the accounting treatment within net realized capital gains (losses). The Company has not held these total return swaps since January 2016.
Contingent Capital Facility Put Option
The Company previously entered into a put option agreement that provided the Company the right to require a third-party trust to purchase, at any time, The Hartford’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500. On February 8, 2017, The Hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the put option agreement, The Hartford had been paying premiums on a periodic basis and had agreed to reimburse the trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification
For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income

accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

Cash Flow Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current period earnings. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the Company had no ineffectiveness recognized in income within net realized capital gains (losses).
As of December 31, 2018, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $23. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income over the term of the investment cash flows.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.
Non-Qualifying Strategies
For non-qualifying strategies, including embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from their host contracts and accounted for as derivatives, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings within net realized capital gains (losses).

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives
The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security

issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers. The diversified portfolios of corporate issuers are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches that possess different credit ratings.

Derivative Collateral Arrangements
The Company enters into various collateral arrangements in connection with its derivative instruments, which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company pledged cash collateral with a fair value of $4 and $1 associated with derivative instruments. The collateral receivable has been recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company also pledged securities collateral associated with derivative instruments with a fair value of $67 and $101, respectively, which

have been included in fixed maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company has also pledged initial margin of securities related to OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivatives with a fair value of $89 and $96, respectively, which are included within fixed maturities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The counterparties generally have the right to sell or re-pledge these securities.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company accepted cash collateral associated with derivative instruments of $9 and $11, respectively, which was invested and recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fixed maturities and short-term investments with corresponding amounts recorded in other investments or other liabilities as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. The Company also

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

accepted securities collateral as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 with a fair value of $5 and $2, respectively, none of which the Company has the ability to sell or repledge. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no repledged securities and did not sell any securities held as collateral. In addition, as of

December 31, 2018 and 2017, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts and was not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

8. REINSURANCE

The Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.
On December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. As of December 31, 2016, other liabilities included $650 for the accrued reinsurance premium paid in January, 2017. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
The ADC has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and the Company reported the $650 cost as a loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For segment reporting, the loss on reinsurance was reported in Property and Casualty Other Operations. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit.  Cumulative

ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred.  Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $523 in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.

The effect of reinsurance on insurance revenues is as follows:

Reinsurance ceded (61 ) (50 ) (44 )
Net earned premiums, fees and other considerations $ 5,598 $ 3,677 $ 3,223

For its group benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an

allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. The increase in premiums assumed in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to premiums related to Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business acquired by the Company effective November 1, 2017 whereby Aetna is fronting the business for a period of time.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures before reinsurance, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

2018 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, primarily for accident years 2014 and 2015, as claim severity has emerged favorably compared to previous reserve estimates. Also

contributing was a reduction in estimated reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expense ("ULAE").

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• General liability reserves were increased, primarily due to an increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures in middle market for accident years 2009 to 2017, partially offset by to the reduction in reserves for other middle market lines were more favorable outcomes due to initiatives to reduce legal expenses. In addition, reserve increases for claims with lead paint exposure were offset by reserve decreases for other mass torts and extra-contractual liability claims.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves were reduced, primarily due to lower reserve estimates for both liability and property for accident years 2010 and prior, including a recovery of loss adjustment expenses for the 2005 accident year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Commercial property reserves were reduced, driven by an increase in estimated reinsurance recoverables on middle market property losses from the 2017 accident year.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional liability reserves were reduced, principally for accident years 2014 and prior, for directors and officers liability claims principally due to a number of older claims closing with limited or no payment.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves were reduced, primarily driven by reduced estimates of loss adjustment expenses in small commercial for recent accident years and favorable development in personal automobile liability for accident years 2014 to 2017, principally due to lower severity, including with uninsured and underinsured motorist claims.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Homeowners reserves were reduced, primarily in accident years 2013 to 2017, driven by lower than expected severity across multiple perils.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $238 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2018 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $238 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Catastrophe reserves were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 catastrophes, principally related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Before reinsurance, estimated losses for 2017 catastrophe events decreased by $133, resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $90 as the Company no longer expects to recover under the 2017 Property Aggregate reinsurance

treaty as aggregate ultimate losses for 2017 catastrophe events are now projected to be less than $850.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Uncollectible reinsurance reserves were increased due to lower anticipated recoveries related to older accident years.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other reserve re-estimates, net, primarily represents an increase in ULAE reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was principally driven by an increase in expected claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental and mass tort claims.

2017 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, given the continued emergence of favorable frequency, primarily for accident years 2013 to 2015, as well as a reduction in estimated reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by strengthening reserves for captive programs within specialty commercial.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• General liability reserves were increased for the 2013 to 2016 accident years on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in recent accident year reserves for other middle market general liability reserves.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves were reduced for accident years 2013 and prior largely due to reducing the Company’s estimate of allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to settle the claims.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Bond business reserves increased for customs bonds written between 2000 and 2010 which was partly offset by a reduction in reserves for recent accident years as reported losses for commercial and contract surety have emerged favorably.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves within Commercial Lines were increased in small commercial and large national accounts for the 2013 to 2016 accident years, driven by higher frequency of more severe accidents, including litigated claims

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $285 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2017 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $285 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Catastrophes reserves were reduced primarily due to lower estimates of 2016 wind and hail event losses and a decrease in losses on a 2015 wildfire.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility

experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.
2016 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers' compensation reserves consider favorable emergence on reported losses for recent accident years as well as a partially offsetting adverse impact related to two recent Florida Supreme Court rulings that have increased the Company’s exposure to workers’ compensation claims in that state. The favorable emergence has been driven by lower frequency and, to a lesser extent, lower medical severity and management has placed additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• General liability reserves increased for accident years 2012 - 2015 primarily due to higher severity losses incurred on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors and increased for accident years 2008 and 2010 primarily due to indemnity losses and legal costs associated with a litigated claim.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, principally for accident years 2013 - 2015. Severity for these accident years has developed unfavorably and management has placed more weight on emerged experience.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2008 - 2013, primarily for large accounts, including on non-securities class action cases. Claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves increased due to increases in both commercial lines automobile and personal lines automobile. Commercial automobile liability reserves increased, predominately for the 2015 accident year, primarily due to increased frequency of large claims. Personal automobile liability reserves increased, primarily related to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the both the direct and agency distribution channels.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the second quarter 2016 comprehensive annual review.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

[2] Asbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. These reserve lines do not have significant paid or incurred loss development for the most recent ten accident years and therefore do not have loss development displayed in triangles.

The reserve lines in the above table and the loss triangles that follow represent the significant lines of business for which the Company regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels. These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC").
The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year. Triangles are limited

to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, not exceeding ten years. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed. IBNR reserves shown in loss triangles include reserve for incurred but not reported claims as well as reserves for expected development on reported claims.

Property and casualty reserves, including IBNR reserves
The Company estimates ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year. IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.
Reserves for losses are set by line of business within the reporting segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are

referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses.
The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. While actuarial methods used and judgments change depending on the age of the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

accident year, in 2018, there were no new methods or types of judgments introduced or changes in how those methods and judgments were applied. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
For both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio is used to record initial reserves. This expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.
As losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as the “actuarial indication”.
Paid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the

reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the expected loss ratio method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for automobile liability. For most lines, reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE", or those expenses related to specific claims) are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. Reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE") are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.
In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For property and casualty, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event.  For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts.

Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 2.1% for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017, to 8.0% for the Company’s pre-acquisition reserves for incurral year 1990, and vary by product. Prior year's discount accretion has been calculated as the average reserve balance for the year times the weighted average discount rate. The decrease in the weighted average discount rate from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the fact that reserves for the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business are discounted at market rates in effect as of the acquisition date.

Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2018 was driven by the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group disability- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $230 largely driven by group long-term disability claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions and, primarily for the 2017 incurral year, claim incidence lower than prior assumptions. Short-term disability also experienced favorable claim recoveries.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $90 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence inclusive of group life, group life premium waiver, and group accidental

 death & dismemberment, principally for the 2017 incurral year.
Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2017 was driven by the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $125 driven by group long-term disability favorable claim incidence for incurral year 2016 and claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Contributing to an approximately $60 decrease in prior period reserve estimates was favorable claim incidence on group life premium waiver for incurral year 2016

Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2016 was driven by the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $90 largely driven by group long-term disability claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions, particularly in the older incurral years. This favorability was partially offset by lower Social Security Disability approvals driven by lower approval rates and backlogs in the Social Security Administration.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver-Contributing to an approximately $75 decrease in prior period reserve estimates was favorable claim incidence on group life premium waiver for incurral year 2015.

The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by the year the insured claim occurred, referred to as the incurral year. Triangles are limited to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding. For group long-term disability, the Company has

provided seven incurral years of claims data as data for earlier periods was not available with respect to the U.S. group life and disability business acquired from Aetna. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed.

Group life, disability and accident reserves, including IBNR
The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for long-term disability ("LTD") claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to

recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.
For incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection.  In these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.
The Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured is unable to work due to disability and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months ("premium waiver reserves"). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.
In addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental death & dismemberment, short term disability, and other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss. IBNR for these lines of business equals the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses less the amount of paid or reported claims depending on whether the paid or reported development method was used. Estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends or other factors that affect the development pattern.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For group life, disability and accident coverages, claim counts include claims that are approved, pending approval and terminated and exclude denied claims. Due to the nature of the claims, one claimant represents one event.

[5] In April, 2017 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the interest payments for the 3 month Libor + 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

The debentures are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.
The Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to a consecutive ten years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.
On June 15, 2018, The Hartford redeemed $500 aggregate principal amount of its 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068. During the initial offering of the 8.125% debentures, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant ("RCC"), and under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeemed the 8.125% debentures at any time prior to June 15, 2048 it could only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. The 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures issued February 15, 2017 are qualifying replacement securities within the definition of RCC. In connection with this redemption, the Company recognized a $6 loss on extinguishment of debt for unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
The 7.875% and 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures may be redeemed in whole prior to the call date upon certain tax or rating agency events, at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole

amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may elect to redeem the 7.875% and 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures in whole or in part on or after the call date for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
In connection with the offering of the three month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture, the Company entered into a RCC for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. The RCC also prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022.
In April, 2017 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the variable interest payments for the 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

Shelf Registrations
On July 29, 2016, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-212778) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.
Revolving Credit Facilities
On March 29, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its Five-Year Credit Agreement dated October 31, 2014. The Amendment reset the level of the Company's minimum consolidated net worth financial covenant to $9 billion, excluding AOCI, from its former $13.5 billion (where net worth was defined as stockholders' equity excluding AOCI and including junior subordinated debt), among other updates. Among other changes, under an amended and restated credit agreement that became effective in June 2018 after the closing of the sale of the Company's life and annuity business, the aggregate

amount of principal of the credit facility decreased from $1 billion to $750, including a reduction to the amount available for letters of credit from $250 to $100, the maturity date was extended to March 29, 2023, and the liens covenant and certain other covenants were modified.
Revolving loans from the Credit Facility may be in multiple currencies. U.S. dollar loans will bear interest at a floating rate equivalent to an indexed rate depending on the type of borrowing and a basis point spread based on The Hartford's credit rating and will mature no later than March 29, 2023. Letters of credit issued from the Credit Facility bear a fee based on The Hartford's credit rating and expire no later than March 29, 2024. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, excluding AOCI, of $9 billion, limit the ratio of senior debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, at 35% and meet other customary covenants. The Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding, $3 in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants
Commercial Paper
As of December 31, 2018, the Hartford's maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program was $750 and there was no commercial paper outstanding. The Company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors. On July 19, 2018, the Board of Directors revised the Company's commercial paper issuance authorization from $1 billion to $750 to align the program with the Company's $750 five year revolving credit facility which became effective on June 11, 2018.
Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
In August 2018, the Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLA”), became members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. FHLBB membership required the purchase of member stock and requires additional member stock ownership of 3% or 4% of any amount borrowed. Acceptable forms of collateral include real estate backed fixed maturities and mortgage loans and the amount of advances that can be taken is limited to a percentage of the fair value of the assets that ranges from a high of 97% for US government-backed fixed maturities maturing within 3 years to a low of 40% for A-rated commercial mortgage-backed fixed maturities maturing in 5 years or more. In its consolidated balance sheets, The Hartford would present the liability for advances taken based on use of the funds with advances for general corporate purposes presented in short- or long-term debt and advances to earn incremental investment income presented in other liabilities, consistent with other collateralized financing transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements. The Connecticut Department of Insurance (“CTDOI”) permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2019. The pledge

limit is determined annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus of Hartford Fire and HLA, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, there were no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.
Litigation
The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties in the following discussion under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.
The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, and in addition to the matters in the following discussion, putative state and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, disability, life and inland marine. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
Asbestos and Environmental Claims
The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.
Significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and particularly asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.
In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.
In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability by the claimant from the insured.
The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims.
Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly evaluates new account information in assessing its potential asbestos and environmental exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.
While the Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company reported $1.1 billion of net asbestos reserves and $203 of net environmental reserves. While the Company believes that its current A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.
Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. Furthermore, cumulative adverse

development of asbestos and environmental claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred cumulative $523 in adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO, leaving approximately $977 of coverage available for future adverse reserve development, if any.

Lease Commitments
The total rental expense on operating leases was $56, $57, and $53 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which excludes sublease rental income of $4, $3, and $2 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company’s lease commitments consist primarily of lease agreements for office space, automobiles, and office equipment that expire at various dates.

Unfunded Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $954, of which $707 is committed to fund limited partnership and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. Additionally, $163 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations associated with private debt and equity securities. The remaining outstanding commitments of $84 relate to mortgage loans. Of the $954 in total outstanding commitments, $48 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-Related Assessments
In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionat

F-70

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

e share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.
Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 the liability balance was $97 and $113, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $2 and $6, respectively, were included in other assets.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2018 was $76, of which the legal entities have

posted collateral of $71 in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2018, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength rates by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2018, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $7 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we post, if required, is primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.

Guarantees
In the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any liabilities associated with these guarantees.
The Hartford has guaranteed the obligations of certain life, accident and health and annuity contracts of the life and annuity business written by Hartford Life Insurance Company between 1990 and 1997 and written by Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company between 1993 and 2009. After the sale of this business in May 2018, the purchaser indemnified the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The guarantees have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments. The Hartford has not recorded a liability and the likelihood for any payments under these guarantees is remote.

15. EQUITY

Capital Purchase Program ("CPP") Warrants
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Company has 1.9 million and 2.2 million CPP warrants outstanding and exercisable. The CPP warrants were issued in 2009 as part of a program established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The CPP warrants expire in June 2019.
CPP warrant exercises were 0.3 million, 1.8 million and 0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The declaration of common stock dividends by the Company in excess of a threshold triggers a provision in the Company's warrant agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon resulting in adjustments to the CPP warrant exercise price and the number of shares deliverable for each warrant exercised (the “Warrant

Share Number”). Accordingly, the CPP warrant exercise price was $8.836, $8.999 and $9.126 and the Warrant Share Number was 1.1, 1.0 and 1.0 as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The exercise price will be settled by the Company withholding the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants equal to the value of the aggregate exercise price of the warrants so exercised determined by reference to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day on which the warrants are exercised and notice is delivered to the warrant agent.
Equity Repurchase Program
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any common shares. In February, 2019, the Company announced a 1.0 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors which is effective through December 31, 2020. Based on projected holding company resources, the Company expects to use a portion of the authorization in 2019

F-71

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

but anticipates using the majority of the program in 2020. Any repurchase of shares under the equity repurchase program is dependent on market conditions and other factors.
Preferred Stock
On November 6, 2018, the Company issued 13.8 million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share), for net cash proceeds of $334. The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Dividends will be payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, commencing on February 15, 2019. If a dividend is not declared before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, The Hartford will have no obligation to pay dividends otherwise attributable to such dividend period. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, no dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.
The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2023 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period. Prior to November 15, 2023, the Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence of (a) a rating agency event at a redemption price equal to $25,500 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a rating agency changes its criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Preferred Stock; or (b) a regulatory capital event at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a capital regulator such as a state insurance regulator changes or proposes to change capital adequacy rules.
On December 13, 2018, The Hartford’s board of directors declared a dividend of $412.50 on each share of the Series G preferred stock (equivalent to $0.4125 per depository share) payable on February 15, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2019.

Statutory Results
The domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively

as "statutory capital". Life insurance subsidiaries include the Group Benefits insurance subsidiary and, for periods up until the sale date, the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Dividend Restrictions
Dividends to the HFSG Holding These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding company) for the twelve-month

period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
Total dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG holding company in 2018 were $3.1 billion. This includes extraordinary dividends of $3.0 billion, comprised of a $1.9 billion principal paydown on the intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018, $226 related to interest payments on the note and $900 to fund near-term obligations of the HFSG holding company. In addition, there was $50 of ordinary P&C dividends that were paid to HFSG holding company, and $110 of capital contributed by the HFSG holding company to a run-off P&C subsidiary. Excluding the interest payments on the intercompany note and dividends that were subsequently contributed to a P&C subsidiary, net dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG holding company were $2.8 billion during 2018.

Total net dividends received by HFSG holding company in 2018 were $2.9 billion, including the $2.8 billion from P&C subsidiaries and $119 from Hartford Funds during the year. There were no dividends received from Hartford Life and Accident in 2018.
Under the formula described above, in 2019, the Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.2 billion in dividends to HFSG Holding Company without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner, though only $200 of this dividend capacity could be paid before the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2019, HFSG Holding Company does not anticipate receiving net dividends from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, as planned 2019 dividends were received in the fourth quarter 2018. The HFSG Holding Company generally expects to receive net dividends of $850 to $900 a year from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries subject to the profitability of those subsidiaries and their capital needs.
Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA") has $380 dividend capacity for 2019 and anticipates paying $250 to $300 dividends in 2019.
There are no current restrictions on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.
Restricted Net Assets
The Company's insurance subsidiaries had net assets of $10.1 billion, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that were restricted from payment to the HFSG Holding Company, without prior regulatory approval at December 31, 2018.

16. INCOME TAXES

Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). Tax Reform establishes new tax laws effective January 1, 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, (3) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, (4) changes to the discounting of statutory reserves for tax purposes, and (5) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017 though there is no impact to the Company’s current NOL carryforwards.
Related to Tax Reform, the Company recorded a provisional net income tax expense of $877 in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net expense consisted of an $821 reduction of the Company’s deferred tax assets primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and a $56 sequestration fee payable associated with refundable AMT credits.
During 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $17 as measurement period adjustments related to Tax Reform due to the filing of the Company's 2017 federal income tax return and completion of the Aetna Group Benefits acquisition. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $56, reflecting the elimination of the sequestration fee payable. In total, the

Company recorded a net income tax benefit from Tax Reform of $39 in 2018.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had AMT carryovers of $841 which are reflected as a current income tax receivable within Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. AMT credits may be used to offset a regular tax liability for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and are refundable at an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Any remaining credits not used against regular tax liability are refundable in the 2021 tax year to be realized in 2022.
Income Tax Expense
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $1,753, $704 and $521 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $0, $19 and $(74) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

[1] Due to the passage of Tax Reform on December 22, 2017, current and prior period federal statutory rates are reflected at 21% and 35% respectively.
In addition to the effect of tax-exempt interest, the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a federal income tax expense of $11 related to non-deductible executive compensation and a benefit of $5 related to a deduction for stock-based compensation that vested at a fair value per share greater than the fair value on the date of grant.
Included in 2018 is a benefit of $39 related to Tax Reform, primarily due to the elimination of the sequestration fee on AMT credits.
Included in 2017 is an expense of $877 due to the effects of Tax Reform, primarily due to the reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Included in 2016 is a benefit of $79 due to the investment in solar energy partnerships. The total tax benefit from the transaction was $113, which included the tax effects of the related financial statement realized loss from writing down the investment in partnerships.

Also included in 2016 is a tax benefit primarily due to the sale of the Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries. The tax benefit of $37 relates to the difference between the tax basis and book basis of the Company's investment in the subsidiaries net of additional foreign tax rate differentials. The total estimated tax benefit recognized in 2016 related to the sale of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries was $76. For discussion of this transaction, see Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent the tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 shown in the table below reflect the lower corporate Federal income tax rate as a result of Tax Reform. Deferred tax balances for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 are not included in the table below as they were included in assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017. In lieu of recording a benefit of the tax capital loss on the sale of the life and annuity business, the Company elected to retain tax net operating loss carryovers with an estimated benefit of $477 as of December 31, 2018.

A deferred tax valuation allowance has not been recorded because the Company believes the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, tax planning strategies. From time to

time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.
As shown in the deferred tax assets (liabilities) table above, included in net deferred income taxes are the future tax benefits associated with U.S. net operating loss carryover and general business credit carryovers. Net operating loss carryovers, if unused, would expire between 2026 and 2036. General business credits would expire between 2026 and 2027.
U.S. NOLs reflected above arose in taxable years prior to 2017 and are still subject to prior tax law which allows for carryback and limits the period over which carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income. Utilization of the Company's loss carryovers is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income. Although the Company projects there will be sufficient future taxable income to fully recover the remainder of the loss carryover, the Company's estimate of the likely realization may change over time.

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release.
In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a receivable of $5 related to a tax indemnification agreement associated with the life and annuity business sold in May 2018. The receivable is separate from the tax liability and is classified as an other asset on the balance sheet.
Other Tax Matters
The federal audits have been completed through 2013, and the Company is not currently under examination for any open years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax related matters for all open tax years.
The Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized no interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company had no interest payable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Investment and Savings Plan
Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under

which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of investments, including up to 10% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of 2.0% of eligible

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 6.0% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee each pay period. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions of employee compensation in excess of the amount that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the Investment and Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan combined, is limited to $1 annually. The total cost to The Hartford for these plans was approximately $134, $113 and $115 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Additionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for these plans was immaterial.
Post Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plan- The Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
The Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances. Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. The interest crediting rate on the cash balance plan is the greater of the average annual yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities or 3.3%. The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plan for certain highly compensated employees, is also frozen.
Group Retiree Health Plan- The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014.

Assumptions
Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plan and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rates and yield curve is based on high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that 4.35% and 4.23% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2018 to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively.
The expected long-term rate of return considers the actual compound rates of return earned over various historical time periods. The Company also considers the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. In addition, the Company considers long-term market return expectations for an investment mix that generally anticipates 60% fixed income securities and 40% non fixed income securities (global equities, hedge funds and private market alternatives) to derive an expected long-term rate of return. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be 6.60% and 6.60% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. To determine the Company's 2019 expense, the Company is currently assuming an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.45% and 6.00% for the Company's pension and other post retirement obligations, respectively.

Changes in assumptions in 2018 primarily included a $281 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 3.73% as of the December 31, 2017 valuation to 4.35% as of the December 31, 2018 valuation. Changes in assumptions in 2017 included a $350 increase in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of a decline in the discount rate from 4.22% as of the December 31, 2016 valuation to 3.73% as of the December 31, 2017 valuation.
The cash balance plan pension benefit obligation was $412 and $443 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The interest crediting rate was 3.30% in 2018, 2017, and 2016.
On June 30, 2017, the Company transferred invested assets and cash from plan assets to purchase a group annuity contract that transferred approximately $1.6 billion of the Company's outstanding pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750. The settlement charge was included in the corporate category for segment reporting.

The fair value of assets for pension benefits, and hence the funded status, presented in the table above excludes assets of $139 and $144 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, held in rabbi trusts and designated for the non-qualified pension plans. The assets do not qualify as plan assets; however, the assets are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and active participants. Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of insolvency. The rabbi trust assets consist of equity and fixed income investments. To the extent the fair value of these rabbi trusts were included in the table above, pension plan assets would have been $3,483 and $3,736 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the funded status of pension benefits would have been $(517)and $(640) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
As a result of the pension settlement, in 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 after tax) and a reduction to stockholders' equity of $144.
In connection with this transaction, the Company made a contribution of $280 in September 2017 to the U.S. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan's pre-transaction funded status.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted the full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change has been made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. The change reduced the before tax interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by $32 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The discount rate being used to measure interest cost was 3.58% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.37% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 3.55% for the non-qualified pension plan, and 3.13% for the postretirement benefit plan. Under the Company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost pension plan and 3.97% for the postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, has recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.

Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.

Target Asset Allocation

----------------------- ------------- -------------------------- ------- ------- -- - -- -

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum
Equity securities 5 % 35 % 15 % 45 %
Fixed income securities 50 % 70 % 55 % 85 %
Alternative assets — % 45 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.
The Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments.

These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative investments and are made up of individual investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage loans and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.
In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

The tables below provide fair value level 3 rollforwards for the Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The Plan classifies the fair value of financial instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for the instruments or, in the absence of active markets, if one or more of the significant inputs used to determine fair value are based on the Plan’s own assumptions. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in fair value due to both observable and unobservable factors.

Concentration of Risk
In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Permissible derivative instruments include futures contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and may be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.
Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford, short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.
Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.

19. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:
Stock-Based Compensation Expense

----------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---- ---- - --- - - --

 For the years ended December 31,
 2018 2017 2016
Stock-based compensation plans expense [1] $ 130 $ 116 $ 81
Income tax benefit (27 ) (41 ) (29 )
Excess tax benefit on awards vested, exercised and expired (5 ) (15 ) —
Total stock-based compensation plans expense, after tax [2] $ 98 $ 60 $ 52

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The increase in stock-based compensation plans expense in 2018 and 2017 was largely due to a change made in 2017 to provide accelerated vesting of newly issued restricted stock unit and performance share awards to retirement eligible employees.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] The increase in stock-based compensation plans expense, after-tax in 2018 is primarily related to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

The Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $64, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.
In the second quarter of 2018, The Hartford modified the terms of the portion of its outstanding 2016 and 2017 performance

share awards that are based on actual versus targeted return on equity over the performance period. The modification eliminated the benefit to return on equity that arose from the charge against earnings in 2017 driven by the effect of the lower corporate income tax rate on the carrying value of net deferred tax assets. This modification had no impact on compensation cost recognized over the vesting period since compensation cost based on the original performance share conditions is projected to be higher than what the cost would be based on the performance share conditions as modified.
Stock Plan
Future stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Incentive Stock Plan") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Incentive Stock Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the Incentive Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third party service providers during the 10-year duration of the Incentive Stock Plan is 12,000,000 shares. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the Incentive Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2018, there were 7,294,481 shares available for future issuance.
The fair values of awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally 3 years. For stock option awards to retirement-eligible employees the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period

F-85

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and therefore the vesting period is considered non-substantive. Beginning with awards granted in 2017, employees with restricted stock units and performance shares receive accelerated vesting upon meeting certain retirement eligibility criteria.
Stock Option Awards
Under the Incentive Stock Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a period of three years commencing one year from the date of grant. Certain other options become exercisable at the later of three years from the date of grant or upon specified market appreciation of the Company's common shares.
The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “valuation model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The valuation model also incorporates the Company’s historical

termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.
The valuation model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, CPP warrants related to the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $14.04, $12.38 and $12.14, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $14, $8, and $1, respectively.

Share Awards
Share awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan and outstanding include restricted stock units and performance shares.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units are share equivalents that are credited with dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid in incremental shares when the underlying units vest.

F-86

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Restricted stock are shares of The Hartford's common stock with restrictions as to transferability until vested. Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, restricted stock units vest at the end of or over three years; certain restricted stock units vest at the end of five years. Beginning in 2017, restricted stock units vest at the earlier of employees retirement eligibility date or three years. Equity awards granted to non-employee directors generally vest in one year and were made in the form of restricted stock units in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Performance Shares
Performance shares become payable within a range of 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of specific performance goals achieved at the end of or over three years. While most performance shares vest at the end of or over three years, certain performance shares vest at the end of five years. Beginning in 2017, performance shares vest at the earlier of employees retirement eligibility date or three years.
Performance share awards that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market price of the Company's

common stock on the date of grant less a discount for the absence of dividends. Stock-compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest based on the performance level achieved and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.
Other performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total stockholder return relative to a group of peer companies within a period of three years from the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo valuation model that incorporates time to maturity, implied volatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and correlations between the Company and the peer companies and interest rates.

The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of performance shares granted during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $50.26, $48.89 and $41.50, respectively.

respectively, based on actual or estimated performance factors. The Company did not make cash payments in settlement of stock compensation during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Subsidiary Stock Plan
In 2013 the Company established a subsidiary stock-based compensation plan similar to The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan except that it awards non-public subsidiary stock as

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

compensation. The Company recognized stock-based compensation plan expense of $9, $9 and $7 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased $4 in subsidiary stock.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 5%

of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2018, there were 4,297,972 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 219,661 shares, 204,533 shares, and 222,113 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $2.56, $2.63 and $2.26 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 5% discount off the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period.

20. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries are included in the P&C Other Operations reporting segment. Revenues and earnings are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Sale of life and annuity business
On May 31, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Holdings, Inc. (HHI), completed the sale of its life and annuity business to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Under the terms of the sale agreement signed December 3, 2017, the investor group formed a limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that acquired Hartford Life, Inc. (HLI), and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, for cash of approximately $1.4 billion after a pre-closing dividend to The Hartford of $300. The Hartford received a 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership, valued at a cost of $164 as of the sale date. In addition, as part of the terms of the sale agreement, The Hartford reduced its long-term debt by $142 because the debt, which was issued by HLI, was included as part of the sale. Including cash proceeds and the retained equity interest and net of transaction costs, net proceeds for the sale were approximately $1.5 billion. The life and annuity operations met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations and are reported in the Corporate category through the date of sale.
The Company recognized a loss on sale within discontinued operations of approximately $3.3 billion in 2017 and a reduction in loss on sale of $202 in 2018. The reduction in loss on sale in 2018 primarily resulted from the reclassification to retained earnings of $193 of tax effects stranded in AOCI due to the accounting for Tax Reform and a $141 increase in estimated retained tax benefits, primarily net operating loss carryovers, partially offset by $104 of operating income from discontinued operations during the period up until the closing date and a reclassification of $10 of net unrealized capital gains from AOCI to retained earnings. See Note 1 - Adoption of New Accounting Standards within Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information about the reclassifications from AOCI to retained earnings. The estimated amount of retained net operating loss carryovers depends on the estimated tax basis of the business sold which increased

F-88

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

subsequent to the date the Company entered into the sale agreement. At closing, stockholders’ equity was further reduced for the amount of AOCI of the life and annuity business, which was approximately $758, largely consisting of net unrealized gains on investments, net of shadow DAC. The AOCI balance was $1 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and outflows of the Company. Additionally, the revenues and expenses presented in continuing operations related to pre-disposal operations were immaterial.
The Company will continue to manage invested assets of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 for an initial term of five years and provide transition services for up to 24 months.
The Hartford reported its 9.7% ownership interest in Hopmeadow Holdings LP, which is accounted for under the equity method, in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Hartford recognizes its share of income in other revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a three month delay, when financial information from the investee becomes available. The Company recognized $8 of income for 2018.

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2018, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon 78 transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2018, there were 2,385 million shares and 469 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding.

During the second quarter of 2018, we completed repurchases under the original authorization to purchase up to $6.0 billion of our Class A common stock.

(7) Rialto Information about homebuilding activities in the Company's urban divisions which are not economically similar to other divisions in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not considered a reportable segment. All prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the Company's current presentation. Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation. The Company's reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina Central: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia Texas: Texas West: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington Other: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments, including FivePoint Operations of the Lennar Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Company's homes and others.

(5) This reflects a reduction of interest expense associated with the fair value mark-up of debt acquired in the RSC acquisition. --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (6) As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (7) This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in connection with our restructuring programs. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

As we collected and prepared necessary data, and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we made adjustments, over the course of the year, to the provisional amounts including refinements to deferred taxes. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act has been completed as of December 31, 2018.

[") on net deferred tax assets, and results of discontinued operations. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Company believes, however, These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. Core earnings are net of preferred stock dividends declared since they are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding. Net income (loss), net income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders or income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company’s business. Therefore, the Company believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and core earnings when reviewing the Company’s performance.

Loss Ratio, excluding Buyouts- utilized for the Group Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Group Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.
Mutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Product Assets- are owned by the shareholders of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products and holds an investment in the fund for a period of time. Mutual fund and ETP assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company’s Hartford Funds segment revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
New Business Written Premium- represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. New business written premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium.
Policies in Force- represents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines and standard commercial lines within Commercial Lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.
Policy Count Retention- represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies available to renew. The number of policies available to renew represents the number of policies, net of any cancellations, written in the previous policy term. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.
Policyholder Dividend Ratio- the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.
Prior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.
Reinstatement Premiums- represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers.
Renewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)- Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines automobile business and

twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s Property and Casualty business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.
Renewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)- for Commercial Lines, represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed. For Personal Lines, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Lines, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate filed with and approved by state regulators during the period and the amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers’ compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.
Return on Assets (“ROA”), Core Earnings- a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment’s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses). ROA, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Hartford Funds.
Underlying Combined Ratio- a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes the underlying combined ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and

Net realized capital gains (losses) changed to net losses of $112 from net gains of $165 for the year ended December 31, 2017, with losses in 2018 primarily driven by net losses on sales of fixed maturity securities due to sector repositioning and duration, liquidity and credit management as well as net losses on equity securities resulting from depreciation in value due to lower equity market levels, partially offset by gains on sales due to tactical repositioning.
Annualized investment yield, after tax of 3.3%, was up 30 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the effect of a lower corporate Federal income tax rate.
Net unrealized gains, after tax for fixed maturities in the investment portfolio decreased by $2,180 compared with the prior year primarily due to the effect of credit spread widening and higher interest rates and the removal of AOCI related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018.

Overview of Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims
It typically takes many months or years to pay claims incurred under a property and casualty insurance product; accordingly, the Company must establish reserves at the time the loss is incurred.

The Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.
Review of Reserve Adequacy- The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed by type of event rather than by line of business.
Reserve adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is

Reserving Methods by Line of Business- Apart from A&E which is discussed in the following section on Property & Casualty Other Operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change.

[' compensation line, particularly for more mature accident years. For less mature accident years, the Company places greater reliance on expected loss ratio methods.
Assumed reinsurance and all other For these lines, the Company tends to rely mostly on reported development techniques. In assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by information gained from claim and underwriting audits.
Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) For some lines of business (e.g., professional liability and assumed reinsurance), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid ALAE to paid loss is applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid ALAE.
Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) ULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For most lines of business, incurred ULAE costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an expected claim handling cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss is applied to estimated unpaid losses.

In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. The Company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves. As of December 31, 2018, recorded reserves were above the actuarial indications by an amount comparable with December 31, 2017.
Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. In general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Such

adjustments of reserves are referred to as “prior accident year development”. Increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. Decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results.
For a discussion of changes to reserve estimates recorded in 2018, see the Reserve Development section below.
Current Trends Contributing to Reserve Uncertainty
The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. The Hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time.

Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed in a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016, will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to net losses incurred before ceding to the ADC. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of A&E claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred a cumulative $523 in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO, leaving approximately $977 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any.
Net and Gross Survival Ratios
Net and gross survival ratios are a measure of the quotient of the carried reserves divided by average annual payments (net of reinsurance and on a gross basis) and is an indication of the number of years that carried reserves would last (i.e. survive) if future annual payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.
The survival ratios shown below are calculated for the one and three year periods ended December 31, 2018. The net basis survival ratio has been materially affected by the adverse development cover entered into between the Company and NICO. The Company cedes adverse asbestos and environmental development in excess of its December 31, 2016 net carried reserves of $1.7 billion to NICO up to a limit of $1.5 billion. Since December 31, 2016, net reserves for asbestos and environmental have been declining as the Company has had no net incurred losses but continues to pay down net loss reserves. This has the effect of reducing the one- and three-year net survival ratios shown in the table below. For asbestos, the table also presents the net survival ratios excluding the effect of the PPG settlement in 2016. See section that follows entitled Major Categories of Asbestos Accounts for discussion of the PPG settlement.

Annual Reserve Reviews
Review of Asbestos Reserves
Since 2017, the Company has performed its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos reserves in the fourth quarter. As part of the evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
During the 2018 fourth quarter review, the Company increased estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance by $167, primarily due to an increase in average mesothelioma settlement values driven by elevated plaintiff demands and defendant bankruptcies. The rise in plaintiff demands also resulted in higher than anticipated defense costs for a small subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of asbestos filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. In addition, the Company observed unfavorable developments in the application of coverage that resulted in increased liability shares on certain insureds. An

Property & Casualty Other Operations.  In conducting these evaluations, the company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment.  The Company analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Property & Casualty Other Operations totaled $105, $86 and $136, respectively.  Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required.

Impact of Re-estimates on Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves
Estimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements.

Ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. Prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.
The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the past ten years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. The ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. For further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see Preferred Reserving Methods by Line of Business - Impact of Changes in Key Assumptions on Reserve Volatility section.

[") Reserves, Net of Reinsurance
The Company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both outstanding reported claims and claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. These reserve estimates can change over time based on facts and interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including The Hartford’s experience with similar cases, claim payment patterns, loss control programs and mix of business. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by various external factors including court decisions and economic conditions. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. Long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an

The weighted average discount rate on LTD reserves was 3.4% and 3.5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our LTD unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $32, pretax, as of December 31, 2018.
Claim Termination Rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - Claim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a given calendar year. Terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. The probability that benefits will terminate in each future month for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past Company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age. Actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. Over the past 10 years, claim termination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 6% below to 13% above current assumptions over that time period. For a single recent incurral year (such as 2018), a one percent decrease in our assumption for LTD claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $9. For all incurral years combined, as of December 31, 2018, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our LTD claim termination rates would increase our Group Benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $22.

Pricing varies significantly by product line with low-to-mid single digit pricing increases expected in property and general liability and higher written pricing increases expected in commercial automobile. In workers’ compensation, given favorable profitability trends, rates are expected to decline in 2019.
The Company expects the Commercial Lines combined ratio will be between approximately 94.5 and 96.5 for 2019, compared to 92.6 in 2018, largely due to lower favorable prior year development, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses expected in 2019. The underlying combined ratio is expected to be flat to slightly higher as earned pricing increases may not keep pace with moderate increases in loss costs, and the Company continues to invest in the business . Current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 3.0 points of the combined ratio in 2019 compared to 3.9 points in 2018.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net income increased in 2018 due to a higher underwriting gain, a lower corporate Federal income tax rate and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net investment income, partially offset by a shift from net realized capital gains in 2017 to net realized capital losses in 2018. (For further discussion of investment results, see MD&A - Investment Results).
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016

Underwriting Gain

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Underwriting gain increased in 2018 primarily due to more favorable prior accident year reserve development in 2018 compared to 2017, lower current accident year catastrophes, and higher earned premium, partially offset by higher underwriting expenses, including higher amortization of DAC.

Pre-tax Charge for Asbestos and Environmental Reserve Increases

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Asbestos Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2018 as a $167 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $167 of losses recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to a higher than previously expected number of mesothelioma claim filings, an increase in the average settlement value of mesothelioma claims, an increase in defense costs, and the Company assuming a greater share of liability due to unfavorable interpretations of coverage. An increase in reserves from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years contributed to the adverse development.
Environmental Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2018 as a $71 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $71 of loss recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with Superfund sites and sediment in waterways, increased defense costs and adverse legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.
Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Asbestos Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2017 as a $183 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $183 of losses recoverable under the NICO treaty. The increase in reserves before NICO reinsurance was primarily due to mesothelioma claim filings not declining as expected, unfavorable developments in coverage law in some jurisdictions and continued filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. An increased share of adverse development from the fourth quarter review is from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years.
Environmental Reserves reflected no net incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in 2017 as a $102 increase in estimated reserves before NICO reinsurance was offset by $102 of loss recoverable under the NICO treaty. The

If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.

Reinsurance for A&E Reserve Development- Under an ADC reinsurance agreement, NICO assumes adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s net A&E reserves recorded as of December 31, 2016. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid for the ADC are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. As of December 31, 2018, $523 of incurred asbestos and environmental losses had been ceded to NICO, leaving approximately $977 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of A&E claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. Furthermore, there is a risk that cumulative adverse development of A&E claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case all adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity.

['s share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.

Assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.
The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize the risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 18 Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets under management in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.

Equity Sensitivity
Investment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
Included in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor']:
Note 18. Restructuring and Other Initiatives 86

['s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Hartford Funds assets under management
Hartford Funds earnings are significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported earnings for that one year period is $(37) as of December 31, 2018. The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration to the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.
Sources of Currency Risk The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments and foreign denominated cash.
Impact Changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities.
Based on the fair values of the Company’s non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a before tax total of $9 and $10, respectively. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.
Management The open foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. In order to manage the currency risk related to any non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, the Company holds non-U.S. dollar denominated investments which match the underlying currency exposure of the liabilities.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities, and cash The fair values of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash, excluding assets held for sale, at December 31, 2018

and 2017 were approximately $178 and $298, respectively. Included in these amounts are $119 and $128 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. The currency risk of the remaining non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps.

Investment in a P&C that was sold during 2017. At December 31, 2016, the derivatives used to hedge the currency impacts had a total notional amount of $200, and a total fair value of $(2), respectively. The Company terminated these hedges in 2017.

Financial Risk on Statutory Capital
Statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin.

Most of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2018 was $76. For this $76, the legal entities have posted collateral of $71, in the normal course of business.

['s international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Sensitivity
In any particular year, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive.

[") as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.

[") and insurance operating costs and expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.
The expense ratio for Group Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. The expense ratio does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business.
Fee Income- is largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, the growth in assets

under management either through positive net flows or favorable market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. Conversely, either negative net flows or unfavorable market performance will reduce fee income.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio- a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.
The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.
Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio before Catastrophes and Prior Accident Year Development- a measure of the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development.

Income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $322 in 2018, increased from a net loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 billion in 2017.

[' insurance claims. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to losses under directors’ and officers’ insurance policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex.
Personal Lines automobile- In Personal Lines, while claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends, particularly for auto liability

claims. Severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment. Changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. Severity trends have increased in recent accident years, in part driven by more expensive parts associated with new automobile technology, causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. In addition, the introduction of new products and class plans has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business.
Impact of Key Assumptions on Reserves
As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements within its reserve estimation process. The Company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.
Across most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.
The following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. For automobile liability lines in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. For workers’ compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. For workers’ compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. For general liability, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims.
Each of the impacts described below add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in total. For any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. The variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and, therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below.

Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims
How A&E Reserves are Set- The process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables. In establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. The Company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, the level of plaintiff demands, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.
Similarly, the Company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. The Company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities or mandated remediation efforts and potential impact of other defendants being in bankruptcy.
After evaluating its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the Company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. The Company considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language, the nature of how policy limits are enforced on multi-year policies and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

The estimated liabilities of insureds and the Company’s exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.
For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. The historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance.
Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance collections. See the section that follows entitled Adverse Development Cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with NICO may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.
Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of A&E Reserves- A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. Reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures.
The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. Future developments could cause the Company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves and if cumulative ceded losses under the adverse development cover (“ADC”) with NICO exceed the ceded premium paid of $650, there could be significant variability in net income due to timing differences between when gross reserves are increased and when reinsurance recoveries are recognized. Consistent with past practice, the Company will continue to monitor its reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. Where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time. In 2018 and 2017, the Company completed the comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter, instead of the second quarter as it had done in previous years.
Total P&C Insurance Product Reserves Development
In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2018 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant

[" Reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations
In the fourth quarters of 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company completed evaluations of certain of its non-asbestos and non-environmental reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities, unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves, and allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.  Overall prior year development on all other reserves resulted in increases (decreases) of $65, $18 and $(20), respectively for calendar years 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Included in the 2018 adverse reserve development was a $38 increase in reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, primarily due to an increase in expected aggregate claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental claims.
The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay.  During the second and third quarters of 2018, the Company increased the allowance by $19, largely driven by potential coverage disputes on a limited number of claims.  During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, and second quarter of 2016, the Company completed its annual evaluations of the collectability of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in

Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and certain tax carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2018, including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and investment market conditions.
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no valuation allowance. The reduction in the valuation

['s estimate of the likely realization may change over time. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had AMT credit carryovers of $841 which are reflected as a current income tax receivable within Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. AMT credits may be used to offset a regular tax liability for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and are refundable at an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Any remaining credits not used against regular tax liability are refundable in the 2021 tax year to be realized in 2022. For additional information about Tax Reform, see Note - 16, Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible, and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.

Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters
Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management

establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.
The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the Company. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.

those will be partially offset by an increase in direct marketing and other expenses to generate new business.

Underwriting loss decreased in 2017 primarily due to a change from unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016 to favorable development in 2017 and lower current accident year loss costs in both auto and homeowners, partially offset by higher current accident year catastrophe losses. The decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily due to lower marketing and operations costs, partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation and the decrease in DAC amortization was driven primarily by lower Agency commissions.
Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Earned premiums decreased in 2018, reflecting a decline in written premium over the prior six to twelve months in both Agency channels and, to a lesser extent, in AARP Direct.
Written premiums decreased in 2018 in AARP Direct and both Agency channels. Despite an increase in new business and stable policy count retention in both auto and homeowners, written premium declined primarily due to not generating enough new business to offset the loss of non-renewed premium.

Credit Risk of Derivatives
The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades.

Managing the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("]:

['s commercial business is written with large deductible policies or retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contract holder for the deductible amount, and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. Additionally, retrospectively rated policies are utilized primarily for workers compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is determined based on actual loss activity. Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it does introduce credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such contract holders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the retrospectively rated policyholders failed to pay additional premiums owed. While the Company attempts to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting, credit analysis, collateral requirements, provision for bad debt, and other oversight mechanisms, the Company’s efforts may not be successful.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.
Sources of Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities, long-term debt obligations, short and long-term disability claim reserves, and discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s pension and other post retirement benefit obligations.
Impact Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.

The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase. The Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the change in the allowance for credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value. No allowance will be recognized at adoption for fixed maturities AFS; rather, their cost basis will be evaluated for an allowance for credit losses prospectively. The Company has not yet determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the ultimate impact of the adoption will depend on the composition of the financial instruments and market conditions at the adoption date. Significant implementation matters yet to be addressed include estimating lifetime expected losses on financial instruments carried at other than fair value, determining the impact of valuation allowances on net investment income from fixed maturities AFS, and updating our investment accounting system functionality to maintain

adjustable valuation allowances on fixed maturities AFS, subject to a fair value floor.
Leases
The FASB issued updated guidance on lease accounting. Under the new guidance, effective January 1, 2019, lessees with operating leases are required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Under guidance effective through December 31, 2018, future minimum lease payments on operating leases are commitments that are not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, leases will be classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease will be a financing lease and the Company will recognize amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease will be an operating lease and the lease costs will be recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less will also be expensed over the lease term but will not be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company will adopt the guidance as of the January 1, 2019, effective date with no change to comparative periods and record a lease payment obligation of approximately $160 for outstanding leases and a right of use asset of approximately $150, which is net of $10 in lease incentives received. The Hartford will elect to apply the package of practical expedients and not reassess expired or existing contracts that are or contain leases; all operating leases will remain classified as operating leases on adoption; and initial direct costs on existing leases will not be reassessed to determine if deferred costs should be written-off or recorded on adoption. The adoption will not impact net income or cash flows.
Reserve for Future Policy Benefits
The FASB issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. The Company’s long-duration insurance contracts include paid-up life insurance and whole-life insurance policies resulting from conversion from group life policies and run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities with total future policy benefit reserves of $642 as of December 31, 2018. Under existing guidance, a reserve for future policy benefits is calculated as the present value of future benefits and related expenses less the present value of any future premiums using assumptions “locked in” at the time the policies were issued, including discount rate, lapse rate, mortality, and expense assumptions. Under existing guidance, assumptions are only updated if there is an expected premium deficiency. The new guidance will require that underlying cash flow assumptions (such as for lapse rate, mortality and expenses) be reviewed and updated at least annually in the same quarter each year. The new guidance also requires that the discount rate assumption be updated each quarter and be based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yield. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating cash flow assumptions will be recognized in net income. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating the discount rate assumption will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Because reserves will be based on updated assumptions and no longer locked in at contract inception, there will no longer be a test for premium deficiency. The new guidance will be effective January 1, 2021,

and will be applied to balances in place as of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method or timing for adoption or estimated the effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The Company charges off any balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $135 and $132 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
Revenue from non-insurance contracts with customers is discussed above in "]:
(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused 

[") and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO, generally certain securities that contain embedded credit

derivatives, and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay and hedge funds on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of investments of consolidated investment funds and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value. The Company has provided seed money for investment funds and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses
Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in fixed maturities, FVO, equity securities, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes as well as ineffectiveness on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances are recognized as net realized capital losses in accordance with the Company’s impairment and mortgage loan valuation allowance policies as discussed in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency transaction remeasurements are also included in net realized capital gains and losses.
Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments are impaired and for certain other asset-backed securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For impaired debt securities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the security by prospectively adjusting the security’s yield, if necessary. The Company’s non-income

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility;

- --------------------
• to manage liquidity;

- -----------------------------
• to control transaction costs;

- -------------------------------------------------
• to enter into synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default value.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative York insurance departments.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to Method”, the “Change in Fair Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”, or the “Dollar Offset Method”.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
 and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item through the applicable earnings component associated with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded

derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("]:

All prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the Company's current presentation. Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation.

[") agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.
Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions.
Reinsurance

Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions.

 specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The fair value process for investments is monitored by the Valuation of annual due-diligence reviews.
There are also two working groups under the Valuation Committee: a Securities Fair Value Working Group (“Securities Working Group”) and a Derivatives Fair Value Working Group ("]:

["). The working groups, which include various investment, operations, accounting and risk

management professionals, meet monthly to review market data trends, pricing and trading statistics and results, and any proposed pricing methodology changes.
The Securities Working Group reviews prices received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The group considers trading volume, new issuance activity, market trends, new regulatory rulings and other factors to determine whether the market activity is significantly different than normal activity in an active market. A dedicated pricing unit follows up with trading and investment sector professionals and challenges prices of third-party pricing services when the estimated assumptions used differ from what the unit believes a market participant would use. If the available evidence indicates that pricing from third-party pricing services or broker quotes is based upon transactions that are stale or not from trades made in an orderly market, the Company places little, if any, weight on the third party service’s transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal process, such as a pricing matrix.
The Derivatives Working Group reviews the inputs, assumptions and methodologies used to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. A dedicated pricing team works directly with investment sector professionals to investigate the impacts of changes in the market environment on prices or valuations of derivatives. New models and any changes to current models are required to have detailed documentation and are validated to a second source. The model validation documentation and results of validation are presented to the Valuation Committee for approval.
The Company conducts other monitoring controls around securities and derivatives pricing including, but not limited to, the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of daily price changes over specific thresholds and new trade comparison to third-party pricing services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Daily comparison of OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of weekly price changes compared to published bond prices of a corporate bond index.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly reviews of price changes over thresholds, stale prices, missing prices, and zero prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly validation of prices to a second source for securities in most sectors and for certain derivatives.

In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for model risk management and provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded futures and option contracts.

Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk primarily related to residential real estate, 
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the fair value of assets and liabilities using the fair value option was $22 and $41, respectively, within the residential real estate sector.
The Company also previously elected the fair value option for certain equity securities in order to align the accounting with total return swap contracts that hedged the risk associated with the investments. The swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and the change in value of both the equity securities and the total

return swaps were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. These equity securities realized capital gains and losses.
For the year-ended December 31, 2018, the realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option were $(1) within the residential real estate sector. For the year-ended December 31, 2017, the income earned from FVO and the changes recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) were driven by corporate bond and equity securities of $(1) and $1, respectively. For the year-ended December 31, 2016 the realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option were $5 and $(1) within the residential real estate and foreign government sectors.

These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an OTTI for certain equity securities with debt-like characteristics if the Company intended to sell or it was more likely than not that the Company was required to sell the security before a recovery in value as well as for those equity securities for which the Company did not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis.

For further discussion on Hopmeadow Holdings LP, refer to Sale of Life and Annuity Business within Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recognized total equity method income of $214, $168, and $137 for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Equity method income is reported in net investment income except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2018 is limited to the total carrying value of $1.5 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $741 to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2018. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management. In 2018, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded 10% of the Company’s pre-tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method. This aggregated summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of investees']:
Note 20. Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests 87

['s derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined fixed maturity securities. The hedge strategies by hedge accounting designation include:
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts and liability payments to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements 
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:
Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to

assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
 rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign information on the disposition, see Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Index Options
The Company enters into equity index capital gains (losses). The Company has not held these total return swaps since January 2016.
Contingent Capital Facility Put Option
The Company previously entered into a put option agreement that provided exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the put option agreement, The Hartford had been paying premiums on a periodic basis and had agreed to reimburse the trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses.

['s procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.
On December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. As of December 31, 2016, other liabilities included $650 for the accrued reinsurance premium paid in January, 2017. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
The ADC has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and the Company reported the $650 cost as a loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For segment reporting, the loss on reinsurance was reported in Property and Casualty Other Operations. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit.  Cumulative

ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred.  Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $523 in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

The allowance recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
Insurance Revenues
The effect of reinsurance on insurance revenues is as follows:

For its group benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an

allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. The increase in premiums assumed in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to premiums related to Aetna']:

The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo valuation model that incorporates time to maturity, implied volatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and correlations between the Company and the peer companies and interest rates.

compensation. The Company recognized stock-based compensation plan expense of $9, $9 and $7 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased $4 in subsidiary stock.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 5%

of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2018, there were 4,297,972 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 219,661 shares, 204,533 shares, and 222,113 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $2.56, $2.63 and $2.26 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 5% discount off the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period.
