ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Business

Haemonetics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative hematology products and solutions to customers to help improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets including blood and plasma component collection, the surgical suite, and hospital transfusion services. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean Haemonetics.

Our products are organized into three categories for purposes of evaluating and developing their growth potential: Plasma, Blood Center and Hospital. For that purpose, “Plasma” includes plasma collection devices and disposables, plasma donor management software, and anticoagulant and saline sold to plasma customers. “Blood Center” includes blood collection and processing devices and disposables for red cells, platelets and whole blood as well as related donor management software. "Hospital", which is comprised of Hemostasis Management and Cell Processing products, includes devices and methodologies for measuring coagulation characteristics of blood, surgical blood salvage systems, specialized blood cell processing systems, disposables and blood transfusion management software.

We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets which require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts.

Recent Developments

Divestiture

On May 21, 2019, we transferred to CSL Plasma Inc. (“CSL”) substantially all of the tangible assets held by Haemonetics relating to the manufacture of anti-coagulant and saline at our Union, South Carolina facility and CSL assumed certain related liabilities pursuant to the terms of a settlement, release and asset transfer agreement between the parties dated May 13, 2019. At the closing, we received approximately $10 million of proceeds and were concurrently released from our obligations to supply liquid solutions under a 2014 supply agreement with CSL. We will continue to supply liquid solutions to our customers following the asset transfer agreement pursuant to our supplier arrangements with contract manufacturers. We expect that cost savings generated from the asset transfer agreement, including the release from our liquid solutions supply obligations, will be reallocated to general corporate purposes. We recognized an impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 of approximately $49 million as a result of this transaction.

Share Repurchase Programs

In May 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of Haemonetics common shares over the next two years. This new share repurchase program will help to offset the dilutive impact of recent and future employee equity grants. The timing and amounts of activity under the repurchase program will be at management’s discretion with the intent of beginning activity under the program during fiscal 2020.

In February 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $260 million of our outstanding common stock through March 30, 2019. As of March 30, 2019, we had utilized the full $260 million share repurchase authorization, which resulted in approximately 3.0 million total shares repurchased at an average price of $86.58 per share.

TEG 6s Trauma Indication

In May 2019, we received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge-based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients.

NexSys PCS® and NexLynk DMS™

In fiscal 2018, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system, including our embedded software that activates YESTM technology, a yield-enhancing solution. We expect to pursue further regulatory clearances for additional enhancements to the overall product offering.

Table of Contents

Our planned roll out of this new platform includes the placement of a significant number of new devices. Such placements will require meaningful capital expenditures and new customer contracts that reflect pricing and volumes appropriate to these investments. We have entered into several long-term commercial contracts for NexSys PCS devices and NexLynk DMS donor management software and are seeking additional contracts from our other Plasma customers.

Relocation of Corporate Headquarters

In December 2018, we announced that we had entered into a lease for office space in Boston, MA that will serve as our new corporate headquarters and replace our existing location in Braintree, MA. We believe our move to Boston, which is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, will attract and retain key talent and provide a dynamic space to engage our employees.

Debt Issuance and Repayment

On June 15, 2018, we entered into a five year credit agreement with certain lenders which provided for a $350.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan") and a $350.0 million revolving loan (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and together with the Term Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). A portion of the net proceeds of $347.8 million was used to pay down the $253.7 million remaining outstanding balance on our 2012 credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2014. The remainder of the proceeds are being used to support the launch of the NexSys PCS device and for general corporate purposes. On August 21, 2018, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert $241.9 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities from a variable rate to a fixed rate of interest.

Long-Term Supply Agreement

As part of our acquisition of the whole blood business from Pall Corporation (“Pall”) in fiscal 2012, Pall agreed to manufacture and install in one of our facilities a filter media manufacturing line (the “HDC line”) for which we agreed to pay Pall approximately $15.0 million (plus pre-approved overages). Pall also agreed to supply media to us for use in leukoreduction filters until such time as we accepted the HDC line.

In May 2018, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Pall under which Pall will continue to supply media to us for use in leukoreduction filters. As a condition of the supply agreement, we agreed to accept the HDC line and to make a final payment of $9.0 million to Pall for the HDC line.

As a result of the decision to continue to source media for our leukoreduction filters from Pall rather than producing them internally, we do not expect to utilize the HDC line for future production and expect that the asset’s future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying value of $19.8 million. Accordingly, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded impairment charges of $19.8 million for the HDC line.

Product Recalls

In March 2018, we issued a voluntary recall of specific lots of our AcrodoseTM Plus and PL Systems sold to our Blood Center customers in the U.S. The recall resulted from reports of low pH readings for platelets stored in the CLX HP bag and, in some instances, an accompanying yellow discoloration of the storage bag. For a period of nine weeks, we were unable to provide our customers with our Acrodose Plus and PL Systems. As a result of the recall, our Blood Center customers may have discarded collected platelets and incurred other damages. During fiscal 2019 we entered into settlement agreements with certain customers responsible for substantially all of the total outstanding claims against us. As of March 30, 2019, we have recorded cumulative charges of $2.2 million associated with this recall which consists of $1.3 million of charges associated with customer returns and inventory reserves and $0.9 million of charges associated with customer claims. Substantially all of these claims have been paid as of March 30, 2019.

In August 2018, we issued a voluntary recall of certain whole blood collection kits sold to our Blood Center customers in the U.S. The recall resulted from some collection sets' filters failing to adequately remove leukocytes from collected blood. As a result of the recall, our Blood Center customers may have conducted tests to confirm that the collected blood was adequately leukoreduced, sold the collected blood labeled as non-leukoreduced at a lower price or discarded the collected blood. As of March 30, 2019, we have recorded cumulative charges of $1.9 million associated with this recall which consists of $0.1 million of charges associated with customer returns and inventory reserves and $1.8 million of charges associated with customer claims. We may record incremental charges for customer claims in future periods associated with this recall.

Restructuring Initiative

In fiscal 2018, we launched a Complexity Reduction Initiative (the "2018 Program"), a company-wide restructuring program designed to improve operational performance and reduce cost, freeing up resources to invest in accelerated growth. This program includes a reduction of headcount and operating costs to enable a more streamlined organizational structure. We expect to incur aggregate charges between $50 million and $60 million associated with these actions, of which we expect $35 million to $40 million will consist of severance and other employee costs and the remainder will consist of other exit costs, primarily related to third party services. These charges, substantially all of which will result in cash outlays, will be incurred as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved and are expected to continue through fiscal 2020. We expect savings from this program of approximately $80 million on an annualized basis once the program is completed. During the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, we incurred $13.7 million and $36.6 million, respectively, of restructuring and turnaround costs under this program.

Market Trends

Plasma Market

There are two key aspects to the market for our plasma products - the growth in demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals and the limited number of significant biopharmaceutical companies in this market.

Changes in demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals, particularly immunoglobulin, are the key driver of plasma collection volumes in the biopharmaceutical market. Various factors related to the supply of plasma and the production of plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals also affect collection volume, including the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Biopharmaceutical companies are seeking more yield from the collected plasma to meet growing demand for biopharmaceuticals without requiring an equivalent increase in plasma supply.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Newly approved indications for auto-immune diseases treated with plasma-derived therapies; the growing understanding and diagnosis of these diseases; longer lifespans and a growing aging patient population increase the demand for plasma.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Geographical expansion of biopharmaceuticals also increases demand for plasma.

Demand for our plasma products in fiscal 2019 continued to grow in North America as collection volumes benefited from an expanding end user market for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals with U.S. produced plasma meeting an increasing percentage of plasma volume demand worldwide. As a result, our Plasma business’ revenues are primarily from the U.S.

Despite the overall growth in the market, the number of biopharmaceutical companies that collect and fractionate the majority of source plasma is low and industry consolidation is ongoing. Significant barriers to entry exist for new entrants due to high capital outlay requirements for fractionation, long regulatory pathways to the licensing of collection centers and fractionation facilities and approval of plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals. With these factors, we do not expect meaningful new entries or diversification. As a result, there are relatively few customers for our Plasma products, especially in the U.S. where 80% of source plasma is collected and only a few customers provide the majority of our Plasma revenue.

Blood Center Market

In the Blood Center market, we sell automated blood component and manual whole blood collection systems, as well as software solutions that include blood drive planning, donor recruitment and retention, blood collection, component manufacturing and distribution. While we sell products around the world, a significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers due to relatively limited number of blood collectors.

Within the Blood Center market, we have seen three trends that have negatively impacted our growth of the overall marketplace despite the overall increase in aging populations. Overall we continue to expect a decline in this business in the low to mid single-digits.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Declining transfusion rates in mature markets due to the development of more minimally invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss, as well as better blood management.

27

Table of Contents

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Competition in multi-unit collection technology for automated blood component collection systems has intensified and has negatively impacted our sales in markets where these collections are prevalent.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Industry consolidation through group purchasing organizations has intensified pricing competition particularly in the manual whole blood collection systems, as well as impacting our software business where switching large customers to new or emerging technology platforms has a relatively high cost.

Hospital Market

Hemostasis Management

Hemostasis Management Market - The use of routine coagulation testing is well established throughout the world in various medical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, trauma, post-partum hemorrhage and percutaneous coronary intervention. While standard tests like prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count have limited ability to reveal a patient’s risk for bleeding, they do not provide information on the patient’s risk for thrombosis. In addition, these routine tests do not provide specific data about clot quality or stability. As a result of these limitations, clinicians are increasingly utilizing advanced hemostasis testing to provide more information about a patient’s hemostasis status, resulting in improved clinical decision-making. In addition, advanced hemostasis testing supports hospital efforts to reduce the risks, complications and costs associated with unnecessary blood component transfusions.

Haemonetics’ TEG® hemostasis analyzer systems are advanced diagnostic tools that provide a comprehensive assessment of a patient’s overall hemostasis. This information enables clinicians to decide the most appropriate clinical treatment for the patient to minimize blood loss and reduce clotting risk. For example, TEG analyzers have been used to support clinical decision making in open cardiovascular surgery and organ transplantation, becoming the “gold standard” in liver transplants. In more recent years, interest has grown into the utilization of TEG in trauma and other procedures in which the risk of hemorrhage and thrombosis are high.

Geographically, TEG systems have achieved the highest market penetration in North America, Europe and China. However, there are considerable growth opportunities in these as well as other markets, as TEG systems become more established as the standard of care around the world.

Cell Processing

Cell Salvage Market - In recent years, more efficient blood use and less invasive surgeries have reduced demand for autotransfusion in these procedures and contributed to intense competition in mature markets, while increased access to healthcare in emerging economies has provided new markets and sources of growth.

Orthopedic procedures have seen similar changes with improved blood management practices, including the use of tranexamic acid to treat and prevent post-operative bleeding, significantly reducing the number of transfusions and autotransfusion.

Geographically, the Cell Saver® has achieved the highest market penetration in North America, Europe and Japan. However, there are considerable growth opportunities in certain Asia Pacific and other emerging markets as addressable procedure volumes grow and the use of autotransfusion is becoming accepted as a standard of care.

Transfusion Management Market - Revenues from BloodTrack® have increased in the U.S. and Europe recently as hospitals seek means to improve efficiencies and meet compliance guidelines for tracking and dispositioning blood components to patients. SafeTrace Tx® leading market share in the U.S. remains steady with potential opportunity to expand internationally.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to the last day of March. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 include 52 weeks with each quarter having 13 weeks.

Net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 7.0% compared with fiscal 2018 both with and without the effects of foreign exchange, as revenue increases in Plasma and Hospital were partially offset by declines in our Blood Center business unit.

Net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 2.0% compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, net revenues increased 1.1% compared with fiscal 2017 as revenue increases in Plasma and Hospital were partially offset by declines in Blood Center.

Operating income increased during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue volumes, favorable price and product mix, lower restructuring and turnaround costs and annualized savings as a result of the prior year restructuring initiatives. This increase was partially offset by asset impairments associated with the HDC line, accelerated depreciation related to PCS®2 devices, higher freight costs driven by revenue volume growth and rising fuel costs and carrier fees and increased investments within our Plasma and Hospital business units.

We recorded operating income during fiscal 2018, as compared with an operating loss during fiscal 2017. Operating income increased primarily as a result of a decrease in asset impairments in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, as well as an increase in gross profit. This operating income was partially offset by increased restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program and increased investments in research and development and sales and marketing primarily in our Hospital and Plasma business units.

Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), to monitor the financial performance of the business, make informed business decisions, establish budgets and forecast future results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Constant currency growth, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in revenue between the current and prior year periods using a constant currency conversion rate. We have provided this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.

International Operations and the Impact of Foreign Exchange
Our principal operations are in the United States, Europe, Japan and other parts of Asia. Our products are marketed in approximately 90 countries around the world through a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors and agents.
The percentage of revenue generated in our principle operating regions is summarized below:

------------- ----------- - ---- ----- ---- ----- -

Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %

International sales are generally conducted in local currencies, primarily Japanese Yen, Euro, Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollar. Our results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in the value of the Yen, Euro and Australian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar.
We have placed foreign currency hedges based on estimates of future revenues to reduce the impacts of currency fluctuations. As compared with fiscal 2018, foreign exchange did not have an impact on sales growth during fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018, as compared with fiscal 2017, the effects of foreign exchange accounted for a 0.9% increase in sales.
Please see section entitled “Foreign Exchange” in this discussion for a more complete explanation of how foreign currency affects our business and our strategy for managing this exposure.

Table of Contents

Plasma
Plasma revenue increased 15.1% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Plasma revenue increased 14.8% during fiscal 2019. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in volume of plasma disposables due to continued strong performance in the U.S. and favorable NexSys PCS pricing during fiscal 2019. Increases in sales of liquid solutions also contributed to the growth during fiscal 2019
On May 21, 2019, we transferred to CSL substantially all of the tangible assets held by Haemonetics relating to the manufacture of anti-coagulant and saline at our Union, South Carolina facility. We will continue to supply liquid solutions to our customers following the asset transfer agreement pursuant to our supplier arrangements with contract manufacturers.
Plasma revenue increased 6.1% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Plasma revenue increased 5.5% during fiscal 2018. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in sales of plasma disposables and software due to continued strong performance in the U.S. This increase was partially offset by a decline in liquid solutions revenue and a decrease in equipment revenue resulting from the divestiture of our SEBRA product line, which contributed $6.5 million in Plasma revenue during fiscal 2017.
Blood Center
Blood Center revenue decreased 5.5% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. There was no foreign exchange impact on Blood Center revenue during fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by lower whole blood revenue due to continued market declines, the strategic exit of certain contracts, products and markets, including unfavorable order timing associated with these exits, as well as product recalls. Declines in software revenue in the U.S and platelet revenue driven by the continued shift toward double dose collection techniques in Japan also contributed to the decrease.
Blood Center revenue decreased 6.2% during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Blood Center revenue decreased 7.5% during fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily due to declines in whole blood revenue in both Europe and the U.S. resulting from continued moderation in the rate of collections and declines in platelet revenue driven by the continued market shift toward double dose collection techniques in Japan, as well as decreased sales in Europe. Decreases in equipment revenue due to a one-time sale of equipment to the American Red Cross in the prior year period and declines in red cell revenue due to the loss of a customer contract in a prior year also contributed to the overall decrease in Blood Center.
Hospital
Hospital revenue increased 7.4% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Hospital revenue increased 7.3% during fiscal 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth of disposables associated with TEG® diagnostic systems, principally in the U.S. and China. The TEG 6s system and TEG Manager® software are approved for the same set of indications as the TEG 5000 system in Europe, Australia and Japan. We continue to pursue a broader set of indications for TEG 6s in the U.S. In May 2019, we received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge-based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients. The increase during fiscal 2019 was partially offset by the continued decline in OrthoPAT® revenue due to better blood management which has reduced orthopedic blood loss. We discontinued the sale of our OrthoPAT products effective March 31, 2019. We offer the Cell Saver Elite + as an alternative autotransfusion system for orthopedics or other medium to low blood loss procedures.
Hospital revenue increased 6.7% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Hospital revenue increased 5.4% during fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth of disposables associated with TEG® diagnostic systems, principally in the U.S. and China. Growth in BloodTrack revenue in the U.S. and Europe also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by the continued decline in OrthoPAT® revenue due to better blood management which has reduced orthopedic blood loss.

Gross profit increased 1.4% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Without the effects of foreign exchange, gross profit increased 0.5% during fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin percentage decreased by 240 basis points for fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in the gross profit margin during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increased depreciation expense primarily due to Plasma devices and asset impairments associated with the HDC line. This decrease was partially offset by favorable price and volume mix as well as savings as a result of the prior year restructuring initiative.
Gross profit increased 8.8% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, gross profit increased 6.4% during fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin percentage increased by 290 basis points for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in the gross profit margin during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to favorable mix, partially offset by continued manufacturing challenges, the impact of the divestiture of SEBRA and increased depreciation expense. The negative impact of asset impairments, inventory charges and the whole blood filter recall on the prior year period also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.

Research and development expenses decreased 9.0% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Without the effects of foreign exchange, research and development expenses decreased 8.4% during fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower restructuring and turnaround costs partially offset by our continued investment of resources in clinical programs, primarily in our Hospital business unit, as well as continued investment in our Plasma business unit.
Research and development expenses increased 4.5% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, research and development expenses increased 5.5% during fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program and our continued investment of resources in clinical programs, primarily in Hospital. These increased costs were partially offset by reduced spending on certain software projects and several projects in Blood Center to better align with our long-term product plans.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.8% during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018. Without the effects of foreign exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.6% during fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of lower restructuring and turnaround costs and annualized savings as a result of the current and prior year restructuring initiatives. This decrease was partially offset by increased investments within our Plasma and Hospital business units, higher freight costs driven by revenue volume growth and rising fuel costs and carrier fees and an increase in variable compensation and share-based compensation expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.9% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.4% during fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of higher restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program, an increase in investments, primarily in Hospital and next generation plasma collection and software systems, and an increase in variable compensation and share-based compensation expense. This increase was partially offset by annualized savings as a result of the prior year restructuring initiative.

Interest and Other Expense, Net
Interest and other expense, net, increased 5.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018 due to an increase in the Term Loan balance as well as an increase in the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on total debt outstanding for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019 was approximately 3.8%.
Interest and other expense, net, decreased 44.1% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of principal payments on our term loan and a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit line.

Reported Tax Rate

We conduct business globally and report our results of operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions in addition to the United States. Our reported tax rate is impacted by the jurisdictional mix of earnings in any given period as the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate.

We have assessed, on a jurisdictional basis, the available means of recovering deferred tax assets, including the ability to carry-back net operating losses, the existence of reversing temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies and available sources of future taxable income. As of March 30, 2019, we maintain a valuation allowance against certain U.S. state deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not realizable and maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.

For the year ended March 30, 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $18.6 million on our worldwide pre-tax income of $73.6 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 25.3%. Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 30, 2019 is higher than our effective tax rates of 23.6% and 4.4% for the years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively. Our increase in tax rate for fiscal 2019, as compared with fiscal 2018, is primarily the result of the impact of the U.S. tax reform provisions that became effective in fiscal 2019, including global intangible low taxed income and nondeductible executive compensation, partially offset by excess stock compensation benefits. The fiscal 2018 rate was higher than the fiscal 2017 tax rate due to the impact of U.S. tax reform (tax expense related to the transition tax liability partially offset by the release of valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets) changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of goodwill impairments in fiscal 2017.

Income Tax Reform

During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted in the United States. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that directed taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as “provisional” when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.

During fiscal 2018 we recognized a provisional amount of $2.0 million as a reasonable estimate of the impact of the provisions of the Act, which was included as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss). During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. We recognized a $0.4 million adjustment to the provisional tax expense recorded in fiscal 2018.

We have incorporated the other impacts of the Act that became effective in fiscal 2019 in the calculation of the tax provision and effective tax rate, including the provisions related to global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”), foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”), base erosion anti abuse tax (“BEAT”), as well as other provisions which limit tax deductibility of expenses. For fiscal 2019, the GILTI provisions have the most significant impact to us. Under the new law, U.S. taxes are

33

Table of Contents

imposed on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of its foreign subsidiaries. The ability to benefit a deduction and foreign tax credits against a portion of the GILTI income may be limited under the GILTI rules as a result of the utilization of net operating losses, foreign sourced income, and other potential limitations within the foreign tax credit calculation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table contains certain key performance indicators we believe depict our liquidity and cash flow position:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- -------- -------------- --- - ------- -

(1)Net debt position is the sum of cash and cash equivalents less total debt.

During fiscal 2018, we launched the 2018 Program, a restructuring initiative designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred $13.7 million and $36.6 million of restructuring and turnaround costs under this program, respectively.

During fiscal 2017, we launched a multi-year restructuring initiative (the "2017 Program") designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure. We did not incur any additional charges under this program during fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2018, we incurred $7.2 million of restructuring and turnaround charges under this program. As of March 30, 2019, charges associated with the 2017 Program are complete.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from employee stock option exercises. We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months. Our expected cash outlays relate primarily to investments, capital expenditures, including production of the NexSys PCS and Plasma plant capacity expansions, share repurchases, cash payments under the loan agreement, restructuring and turnaround initiatives and acquisitions. These are described in more detail in Contractual Obligations below.

As of March 30, 2019, we had $169.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held in the U.S. or in countries from which it can be freely repatriated to the U.S. On June 15, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a $350.0 million Term Loan and a $350.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facilities expire on June 15, 2023. Interest on the Credit Facilities is established using LIBOR plus 1.13% - 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. Under the Credit Facilities, we are required to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios specified in the credit agreement as well as other customary non-financial affirmative and negative covenants. A portion of the net proceeds of $347.8 million was used to pay down the $253.7 remaining outstanding balance on our 2012 credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2014. The remainder of the proceeds are being used to support the launch of our NexSys PCS device and for general corporate purposes. At March 30, 2019, $336.9 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and $15.0 million was outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility, both, with an effective interest rate of 3.8%. We also had $25.1 million of uncommitted operating lines of credit to fund our global operations under which there were no outstanding borrowings as of March 30, 2019.

During fiscal 2019, we paid $13.1 million in scheduled principal repayments for the Term Loan. We have scheduled principal repayments of $336.9 million required through fiscal 2024. We were in compliance with the leverage and interest coverage ratios specified in the credit agreement as well as all other bank covenants as of March 30, 2019.

(1)The balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate local currency amounts into U.S. dollars. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have eliminated the effect of foreign currency throughout our cash flow statement, except for its effect on our cash and cash equivalents.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.3 million during fiscal 2019, a decrease of $61.1 million as compared with fiscal 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a working capital outflow driven largely by an increase accounts receivable due to higher revenue growth and collections timing, an increase in inventory to support the launch of the NexSys PCS device and decreases in accrued payroll due to severance payments associated with the 2018 Program. Net income, as adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges, partially offset the decrease in operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.6 million as compared with fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, and a working capital inflow resulting from a decrease in inventories due to an overall improvement in our demand planning process. An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which was largely driven by restructuring and turnaround reserves associated with the 2018 Program and variable compensation, as well as decreases in other current assets also contributed to the cash inflow.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $116.1 million during fiscal 2019, an increase of $53.1 million as compared with fiscal 2018. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures in the current year period due to the NexSys PCS launch and manufacturing capacity expansion projects in our Plasma business and proceeds received related to the divestiture of our SEBRA product line in the prior period.

Net cash used in investing activities was $63.0 million during fiscal 2018, a decrease of $10.3 million as compared with fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the proceeds received related to the divestiture of our SEBRA product line and to a lesser extent a reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $50.6 million during fiscal 2019, a decrease of $70.0 million as compared with fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities included the repayment of the $253.7 remaining outstanding balance on our 2012 credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2014, as well as $160.0 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2019. This use in cash was partially offset by proceeds resulting from the $350.0 million Term Loan entered into in June 2018.

35

Table of Contents

Net cash used in financing activities was $120.6 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.2 million as compared with fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to $100.0 million of share repurchases and an incremental $19.0 million of principal repayments on our 2012 credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2014, as compared with the prior year. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a reduction in borrowings on our previous revolving credit facility of $50.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an incremental $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.

Contractual Obligations

A summary of our contractual and commercial commitments as of March 30, 2019 is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Interest payments reflect the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and exclude the impact of interest rate swap agreements. Interest payments are projected using interest rates in effect as of March 30, 2019. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(2) Includes amounts we are committed to spend on purchase orders entered in the normal course of business for capital equipment as well as commitments with contractors for the manufacture of certain disposable products and equipment. The majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment.

The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these long-term liabilities due to factors outside of our control, such as tax examinations.

Concentration of Credit Risk

While approximately 52% of our revenue during fiscal 2019 was generated by our ten largest customers, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. Certain markets and industries, however, can expose us to concentrations of credit risk. For example, in the Plasma business unit, sales are concentrated with several large customers. As a result, accounts receivable extended to any one of these biopharmaceutical customers can be significant at any point in time. In addition, a portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the U.S. include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays and local economic conditions. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries' national economies.

We have not incurred significant losses on receivables. We continually evaluate all receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of customers or the countries' healthcare systems deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, allowances may be required in future periods.

Legal Proceedings

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows. For a discussion of our material legal proceedings refer to Note 15, Commitments & Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Historically, we believe we have been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies, by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of products. We continue to monitor inflation pressures generally and raw materials indices that may affect our procurement and production costs. Increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.

Foreign Exchange

During fiscal 2019, 37.3% of our sales were generated outside the U.S., generally in foreign currencies, yet our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. We also incur certain manufacturing, marketing and selling costs in international markets in local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures relate to sales denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollars. We also have foreign currency exposure related to manufacturing and other operational costs denominated in Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit. The Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exposure is partially mitigated by costs and expenses for foreign operations and sourcing products denominated in foreign currencies.

Since our foreign currency denominated Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exceed the foreign currency denominated costs, whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations and, conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. For Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit our primary cash flows relate to product costs or costs and expenses of local operations. Whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. Conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to these currencies, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. That program includes the use of derivative financial instruments to minimize, for a period of time, the unforeseen impact on our financial results from changes in foreign exchange rates. We utilize forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Japanese Yen and Euro, and to a lesser extent Swiss Francs, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Mexican Pesos. This does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates, but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out, rates are fixed for a one-year period, thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Standards to be Implemented

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASC Update No. 2016-02 is intended to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease asset and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, including those previously classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Update No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued an update to the leasing guidance to allow an additional transition option which would allow companies to adopt the standard as of the beginning of the year of adoption as opposed to the earliest comparative period presented. We adopted the new standard on March 31, 2019.

Upon transition, we plan to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under ASC Update No. 2016-02 transition guidance to our entire lease portfolio at March 31, 2019. As a result, we are not required to reassess (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the classification of any expired or existing leases, and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases.

As a result of adopting ASC Update No. 2016-02, we expect to recognize additional right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities for our existing lease portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets of approximately $20 million to $25 million, with no material impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, we are

37

Table of Contents

in the process of implementing a new lease administration and lease accounting system, and updating our controls and procedures for maintaining and accounting for our lease portfolio under the new standard.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326). ASC Update No. 2016-13 is to intended to replace the current incurred loss impairment methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information, including forecasted information, to develop credit loss estimates. ASC Update No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2021. We are in the process of determining the effect that the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715). The guidance revises the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2017-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new guidance will align the accounting for non-employee share-based payments with the existing employee share-based transactions guidance. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including interim periods, but no earlier than the entity's adoption of ASC Topic 606. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2018-07 on our financial position and results of operations is being assessed by management.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2018-15, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). The new guidance will align the accounting implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for internal-use software licenses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and is applicable to us in fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including interim periods. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2018-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and/or estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration related to rebates, product returns and volume discounts. These reserves, which are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales, are recorded as a reduction of revenue and a current liability. Our estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period. Revenue recognized in the current period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not material. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum potential rebate or discount that could be earned. In circumstances where we provide upfront rebate payments to customers, we capitalize the rebate payments and amortize the resulting asset as a reduction of revenue using a systematic method over the life of the contract. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6, Revenue, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.

Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, product actions and/or competitive technology developments,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to implement successfully and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital and increases in our market-participant tax rate and/or changes in tax laws or macroeconomic conditions.

Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in future impairment charges.

We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain conditions arise to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, or that a change in the remaining useful life is required. Conditions indicating that an impairment exists include but are not limited to a change in the competitive landscape, internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies, a loss of a significant customer or a significant change in the marketplace including prices paid for our products or the size of the market for our products. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9, Goodwill & Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Inventory Provisions

We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared with forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Additionally, uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.

Income Taxes

The income tax provision is calculated for all jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax provision process involves calculating current taxes due and assessing temporary differences arising from items that are taxable or deductible in different periods for tax and accounting purposes and are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realizability and a valuation allowance is maintained for the portion of our deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not realizable. All available evidence, both positive and negative, has been considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed against the deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 4, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances including a discussion of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.

We file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions

39

Table of Contents

presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. We record a liability for the portion of unrecognized tax benefits claimed that we have determined are not more-likely-than-not realizable. These tax reserves have been established based on management's assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment.

Contingencies

We may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, employee related litigation, self-insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a loss is probable and a range of loss is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies.

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.

Foreign Exchange

During fiscal 2019, 37.3% of our sales were generated outside operations and sourcing products denominated in foreign currencies.

Since our foreign currency denominated Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exceed the foreign currency denominated costs, whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations and, conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. For Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit our primary cash flows relate whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to these currencies, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. That program includes the use of derivative financial instruments to minimize, for a period of time, the unforeseen impact on our financial results from changes in on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results.
