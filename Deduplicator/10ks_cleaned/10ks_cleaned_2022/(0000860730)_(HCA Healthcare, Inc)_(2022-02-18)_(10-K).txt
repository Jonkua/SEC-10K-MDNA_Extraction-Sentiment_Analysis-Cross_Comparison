Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $8.959 billion in 2021 compared to $9.232 billion in 2020 and $7.602 billion in 2019. The $273 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2021, compared to 2020, was related to a negative change in working capital items of $1.781 billion, primarily from an increase in accounts receivable, offset by the increase in net income, excluding the non-cash impact of losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and depreciation and amortization. The $1.630 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $330 million and positive changes in working capital items of $1.366 billion, primarily from the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the collection of accounts receivable. During 2020, we deferred $688 million of Social Security taxes as allowed for under the CARES Act. Half of these taxes were paid in January 2022 and the remainder will be paid in 2023. Working capital totaled $3.960 billion at December 31, 2021 and $3.629 billion at December 31, 2020. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $1.075 billion for 2021 compared to 2020 and declined $154 million for 2020 compared to 2019.
Cash used in investing activities was $2.643 billion, $3.393 billion and $5.720 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $3.577 billion in 2021, $2.835 billion in 2020 and $4.158 billion in 2019. We expended $1.105 billion, $568 million and $1.682 billion for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In response to the risks the
COVID-19 pandemic presents to our business, we reduced certain planned projects and capital expenditures during 2020. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $4.2 billion in 2022. At December 31, 2021, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over

the next five years of approximately $4.239 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. Sales of hospitals and health care entities increased $2.092 billion for 2021, compared to 2020, primarily related to the proceeds from our sales of five hospitals in Georgia and other health care entity investments.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $6.655 billion in 2021, $4.677 billion in 2020 and $1.771 billion in 2019. During 2021, we had a net increase of $3.255 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $624 million and paid $8.215 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2020, we made net payments of $3.217 billion related to our indebtedness, paid dividends of $153 million and paid $441 million for repurchases of our common stock. During 2019, we had a net increase of $567 million in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $550 million and paid $1.031 billion for repurchases of our common stock. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $749 million, $626 million and $542 million, respectively.

We, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws.

During January 2020 and 2019, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs for up to $4 billion ($2 billion for each authorization) of our outstanding common stock. During February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $6 billion for share repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The January 2020 and 2019 authorizations were completed during 2021, and at December 31, 2021, there was $586 million of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the February 2021 authorization. During January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $8 billion for share repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

During 2021, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.48 per share, or $1.92 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2022. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($3.640 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $3.258 billion as of January 31, 2022) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.

Investments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled $541 million and $504 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $154 million and $188 million at

December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $75 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.813 billion and $1.736 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $497 million. We estimate that approximately $448 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $34.579 billion and $31.004 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our interest expense was $1.566 billion for 2021 and $1.584 billion for 2020.

During June 2021, we issued $2.350 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 2 3/8% notes due 2031 and $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 1/2% notes due 2051 (the “June 2021 Notes”). We also amended and restated our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, including increasing availability under the asset-based revolving credit facility to $4.500 billion, extending the maturity date on both facilities to June 30, 2026 and entering into $2.000 billion of new term loan facilities (the “Credit Agreement Transactions”). We used the net proceeds from the June 2021 Notes and the Credit Agreement Transactions to retire $3.657 billion of term loan facilities.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

Summarized Financial Information
HCA Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of HCA Healthcare, Inc., is the primary obligor under a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes. The senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes issued by HCA Inc. are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by HCA Healthcare, Inc. The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). For a list of subsidiary guarantors, see Exhibit 22 to this annual report on Form
10-K.
The subsidiary guarantees rank senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of each subsidiary guarantor, equally in right of payment with all senior indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any
non-guarantor subsidiaries of the subsidiary guarantors (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to one of the subsidiary guarantors). The subsidiary guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to certain exceptions, that secure our senior secured cash flow credit facility on a first-priority basis. The

subsidiary guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the subsidiary guarantors’ assets that secure our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility on a first-priority basis and our senior secured cash flow credit facility on a second-priority basis.
The subsidiary guarantees may be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon certain customary events, including in the event such guarantee is released under our senior secured credit facilities. The indentures governing the senior secured notes include a “savings clause” intended to limit each subsidiary guarantor’s obligations as necessary to prevent the guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which could reduce a subsidiary guarantor’s liability on its guarantee to zero. For further information regarding the guarantees, refer to the applicable indentures that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form
10-K.

Summarized financial information is presented on a combined basis and transactions between the combining entities have been eliminated. Financial information for nonguarantor entities has been excluded. The summarized operating results information for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the summarized balance sheet information at December 31, 2021, for HCA Healthcare, Inc., HCA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors (the Parent, Subsidiary Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors) follow (dollars in millions):

The first-priority liens securing the subsidiary guarantees discussed above include liens on (i) substantially all of the capital stock of substantially all wholly owned first-tier subsidiaries of HCA Inc. or of subsidiary guarantors (but limited to 65% of the stock of any such wholly owned first-tier subsidiary that is a foreign subsidiary), subject to certain limited exceptions, and (ii) substantially all indebtedness owing to HCA Inc. or to the subsidiary guarantors, including any and all intercompany indebtedness owed by HCA Healthcare, Inc. or any subsidiary thereof to HCA Inc., or any subsidiary guarantor. For a list of affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes, see Exhibit 22 to this annual report on Form
10-K.
Under the first lien intercreditor agreement, the administrative agent for the lenders under the cash flow credit facility, subject to the occurrence of certain events, has the exclusive right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to these liens, and the trustee for the senior secured notes has no right to take any such actions. In certain circumstances, including upon certain events of default under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior secured notes, the collateral agent in respect of the cash flow credit facility and the senior secured notes could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure such indebtedness, including the aforementioned pledged capital stock and pledged indebtedness, and require such collateral to be delivered to the collateral agent to the extent not already in its possession for purposes of perfecting the lien on such assets. For further information regarding the collateral, including events or circumstances that may require delivery of the collateral, refer to the applicable indentures, the first lien intercreditor agreement, the cash flow credit agreement and the pledge agreement that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form
10-K.

There is no trading market for any of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes.
Rule
13-02 of Regulation
S-X requires the presentation of summarized financial information of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes unless such information is not material. The rule provides that such information is not material if the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Registrant. Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA Inc., and the common stock of Healthtrust is pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure relationship of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and Healthtrust, all of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s operating subsidiaries, including all other affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes, are also subsidiaries of Healthtrust. The corporate structure relationship, combined with the application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s consolidated financial statements related to HCA Healthcare Inc.’s debt and financial instruments, mean that the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Healthtrust (and, therefore, of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes) are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the financial statements of HCA Healthcare, Inc. As a result, summarized financial information of affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes is not required to be presented under Rule
13-02.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. Our insurance subsidiaries held $541 million of investment securities at December 31, 2021. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, we had a net unrealized gain of $16 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $4.240 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2021 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $30.339 billion at December 31, 2021 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.9% for 2021 and 5.0% for 2020.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $38.541 billion at December 31, 2021. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $42 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

We are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.

Tax Examinations

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting an examination of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 return for one affiliated partnership at December 31, 2021. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
