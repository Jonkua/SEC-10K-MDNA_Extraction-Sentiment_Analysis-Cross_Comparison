Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
(3) This debenture is not subject to any sinking fund requirement and is no longer redeemable prior to maturity.

As of July 2, 2022, the principal and interest payments required to be made during the next five fiscal years on Sysco’s senior notes and debentures are shown below:

(In thousands)
 2023 $ 521,398 $ 450,364

 2026 750,000 414,011
 2027 1,043,176 383,449

(1) Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of July 2, 2022, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. The impact of our outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of July 2, 2022.

On April 29, 2022, Sysco entered into a long-term revolving credit facility to replace its previous $2.0 billion facility. The new facility includes aggregate commitments of the lenders thereunder of $3.0 billion, with an option to increase such commitments to $4.0 billion. The new facility includes a covenant requiring Sysco to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0 over four consecutive fiscal quarters. The new revolving credit facility expires on April 29, 2027. As of July 2, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.

Sysco has a U.S. commercial paper program allowing the company to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion. Any outstanding amounts are classified within long-term debt, as the program is supported by the long-term revolving credit facility. As of July 2, 2022, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under this program.

Purchases and redemptions of senior notes and debentures

In December 2021, the company accessed favorable credit markets and undertook a refinancing of previously outstanding senior notes to increase its weighted-average maturity profile and decrease its average interest rates on the company’s debt portfolio. As part of the refinancing, on December 14, 2021, Sysco issued senior notes (the “Notes”) totaling $1.25 billion. Details of the Notes are as follows:

Maturity Date Par Value(in millions) Coupon Rate Pricing(percentage of par)
---------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------- -------------------------- - ------ -
December 14, 2031 (the 2031 Notes) $ 450 2.45 % 99.578 %
December 14, 2051 (the 2051 Notes) 800 3.15 99.308

The Notes initially are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes issued under the indenture governing the Notes or any of Sysco’s other indebtedness. Interest on the Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on June 14 and December 14, beginning June 14, 2022. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem (i) the 2031 Notes before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date, or (ii) the 2051 Notes before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such senior notes matured on the applicable date described above. If Sysco elects to redeem a series of Notes on or after the applicable date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to the redemption date.
On December 14, 2021, Sysco redeemed $1.25 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of its 5.650% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “5.650% Notes”) and 3.550% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “3.550% Notes”). Sysco used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all of Sysco’s outstanding 5.650% Notes and 3.550% Notes. The redemption price for the senior notes of each such series that were redeemed was the principal amount of such senior notes plus a “make-whole” amount determined in accordance with the indenture governing such senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The redemption was considered to be a debt extinguishment. As such, Sysco recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $115.6 million, which is recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated results of operations. Of this loss, $132.7 million was attributable to the purchase premium paid to the noteholders, and $6.0 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with the redeemed notes, offset by a gain of $23.1 million attributable to the termination of interest rate swap agreements that were serving as a fair value hedge.

 In June 2022, Sysco repaid 2.60% senior notes totaling $450 million at maturity using cash flow from operations.

As of July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, letters of credit outstanding were $202.9 million and $246.5 million, respectively.

LEASES
LEASES
Sysco leases certain of its distribution and warehouse facilities, office facilities, fleet vehicles, and office and warehouse equipment. The company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and recognizes a finance or operating lease liability and right-of-use (ROU) asset in the consolidated balance sheets if a lease exists. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. If the borrowing rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, Sysco uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.

The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise one of these options. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in Sysco’s consolidated balance sheets, and the company recognizes expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate, such as insurance and property taxes, are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized as variable lease cost when the obligation for that payment is incurred. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Sysco’s leases do not contain significant residual value guarantees and do not impose significant restrictions or covenants.

The following table presents the location of the finance lease ROU assets and lease liabilities in the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021:

Employer Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans of $52.8 million and $42.0 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no contributions made to the U.S. Retirement Plan in fiscal 2022, as there were no required contributions to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2022. There are no required contributions to the U.S. Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2023. The company’s contributions to the SERP plan are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated aggregate fiscal 2023 contribution to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan is $32.0 million. The estimated fiscal 2023 contributions to fund benefit payments for the international retirement plans are $20.3 million.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Estimated future benefit payments for vested participants, based on actuarial assumptions, are as follows:

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
---------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.91 % 3.12 %
Discount rate — SERP 4.84 2.91
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.65 1.90
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.00 2.56

As benefit accruals under the SERP and U.K. Retirement Plan are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of July 2, 2022 or July 3, 2021.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs for each fiscal year were:

 2022 2021 2020
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.12 % 2.94 % 3.70 %
Discount rate — SERP 2.91 2.91 3.62
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 1.90 1.60 2.30
Expected rate of return — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.50 4.75 5.00
Expected rate of return — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.30 2.55 4.55
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.56 2.56

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized corporate bond yield curve to estimate the rate at which pension benefits could effectively be settled to estimate a discount rate for the U.K. Retirement Plan. The discount rate assumption is updated annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.91% and 3.65%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 4.84%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the retirement plans are net return on assets assumption, representing gross return on assets less asset management expenses. Specific to the U.S. Retirement Plan, administrative expenses are also excluded from the gross return on assets. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, the historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The expected return for the U.K. Retirement Plan is derived from a long-term swap yield time horizon adjusted for the expected return based on the plan’s current asset allocation and historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.50% and 4.65%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for the U.S. Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit payments and to balance risk and return commensurate with ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities using an investment strategy that closely aligns the duration of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities. In order to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design, decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures, monitors the performance of plan investment managers and investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation of pension plan contributions. The strategy results in an asset portfolio that more closely matches the behavior of the liability, thereby reducing the volatility of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. This structure ensures the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a set of investment guidelines for the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment managers to specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money except for real estate, private equity or hedge fund portfolios where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and permitted in the investments’ governing documents, the purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating of any securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or the investment manager. The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are allowed to use derivative securities so long as they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio. Such derivative securities have been used to prevent funded status changes due to interest rate changes.
The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of July 2, 2022 is as follows:

U.S. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Growth assets 30 % 28 %
Liability hedging assets 70 72
 100 %

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively managed investment funds. Growth assets include, but are not limited to, equities, alternatives, real estate, and growth fixed income intended to generate returns in excess of the liability growth rate. The Liability Hedging assets will be comprised primarily of fixed income investments, including interest rate and credit derivatives, intended to reduce funded status volatility due to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, while generating returns consistent with the projected liability growth rate. The U.S. Retirement Plan’s portfolio includes investment funds which are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The day-to-day management of the assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan has been delegated by the plan trustee to a fiduciary manager who decides the composition of the asset portfolio in line with the objectives of the plan’s trustee and within specific investment guidelines agreed upon with the trustee. The primary objective for the U.K. Retirement Plan is to provide sufficient assets to pay benefits as they fall due. The current objective for the U.K. Retirement Plan is to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.1% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over a rolling five-year period. The liability benchmark is the portfolio of gilts, which are bonds issued by the British government, that best matches the liability profile of the U.K. Retirement Plan. The investment objective includes a risk statement that targets a level of investment tracking error versus the liability benchmark to be below 10% per year. The actual tracking error targeted may fluctuate over time as the composition of the portfolio changes and the levels of risk in markets change. The U.K. Retirement Plan’s Trustee and its Fiduciary Manager seek to achieve the Plan’s investment objectives by investing in a suitably diversified mix of assets. The U.K. Retirement Plan uses derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps and options for risk management and for the efficient implementation of the investment strategy.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s target investment allocation and actual investment allocation for fiscal 2022 is as follows:

U.K. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Common contractual fund 40 % 45 %
Liability hedging assets 60 55
 100 %

The actual asset allocation differed from the target asset allocation due to market conditions at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily the impact of UK bond yield changes.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets both managed by the solvency manager. The pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range of geographies and including private equity investments, (2) credit investments including global investment grade and high yield bonds, loans and other debt and derivative securities, (3) property investments including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, and (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than physical assets. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the retirement plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the trustee and solvency manager ensure diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.
Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price). See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s retirement plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 and Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. Equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table below. If a stock is not listed on a public exchange, such as an American Depository Receipt or some preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid price based on a compilation of observable market information. Equity securities not listed on a public exchange are classified as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund. Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment fund as determined by the underlying private investment fund’s general partner. Indirectly held investments are valued utilizing the latest financial reports supplied by the fund’s portfolio investments. Directly held investments are valued initially based on transaction price and are adjusted utilizing available market data and investment-specific factors, such as estimates of liquidation value, prices of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices for standard-length forward foreign currency contracts and adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being valued. Foreign currency contracts are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

Individually Significant Plans

The following information relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that Sysco has determined to be individually significant to the company. As noted below, the company has determined only one plan – the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan – as currently being individually significant to the company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:
•The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).
•The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary, together with information included in the annual return/reports filed by each plan with the U.S. Department of Labor. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The Multiemployer Protection Act of 2014 created a new zone called “critical and declining.” Plans are generally considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years.
•The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans or a rehabilitation plan (RP) for red zone plans is pending or implemented in the current year or was put in place in a prior year. A status of “Pending” indicates a FIP/RP has been approved but actual period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.
•The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge or supplemental contribution was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the yellow, orange or red zone. If the company’s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a plan satisfies the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented FIP or RP, then the payment of surcharges or supplemental contributions is not required and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented FIP or RP, then the payment of surcharges or supplemental contributions is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

(1) Sysco is party to 24 CBAs that require contributions to the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. Each agreement covers anywhere from less than 1% to 19% of the total contributions Sysco is required to pay the fund.

The following table provides information about the company’s contributions to individually significant plans:
•The “Sysco Contributions” columns provide contribution amounts based on Sysco’s fiscal years, which may not coincide with the plans’ fiscal years.

•The “Sysco 5% of Total Plan Contributions” columns indicate whether Sysco was listed on Schedule R of the plan’s most recently filed Form 5500s as providing more than five percent of the total contributions to the plan, and the plan year-end is noted.

Exercisable as of July 2, 2022 6,542,396 $ 59.64 5.45 $ 174,535

The total number of employee options granted was 1,224,150, 1,975,413 and 3,286,943 in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
During fiscal 2022, 499,554 and 724,596 options were granted to 11 executive officers and 145 other key employees, respectively. During fiscal 2021, 706,229 and 1,269,184 options were granted to 13 executive officers and 117 other key employees, respectively. During fiscal 2020, 1,554,566 and 1,732,377 options were granted to 12 executive officers and 174 other key employees, respectively.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $17.39, $13.72 and $10.57, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $5.1 million, $6.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, 758,934, 975,886 and 704,732 restricted stock units, respectively, were granted to employees, the majority of which will vest ratably over a three-year period. Some of these restricted stock units were granted with dividend equivalents. The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends as of the date of grant date during the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $80.31, $66.55 and $71.01, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $41.6 million, $34.8 million and $30.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $52.6 million, $42.6 million and $35.7 million, respectively.

Non-Employee Director Awards

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, 22,293, 28,419 and 27,431 restricted equity awards, respectively, were granted to non-employee directors (NEDs), which will vest over a one-year period. NEDs may elect to receive these awards in restricted stock shares that will vest at the end of the award stated vesting period or as deferred units that convert into shares of Sysco common stock on a date subsequent to the award stated vesting date selected by the NED. The fair value of the restricted awards is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the shares granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $74.93, $71.99 and $74.17, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock shares vested and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $1.7 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Restricted stock shares are valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

NEDs may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual or deferred basis. As a result of such elections, a total of 6,002, 5,887 and 4,187 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $78.35, $57.19 and $75.46 per share were issued in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the form of fully vested common stock or deferred units. The total fair value of common stock issued as a result of election shares and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Common stock shares are valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

As of July 2, 2022, there were 100,272 fully vested deferred units outstanding that will convert into shares of Sysco common stock upon dates selected by the respective NED.

Summary of Equity Instruments Other Than Stock Options

The following summary presents information regarding outstanding non-vested awards as of July 2, 2022 and changes during the fiscal year then ended with regard to these awards under the stock incentive plans. Award types represented include restricted stock units granted to employees, restricted awards granted to non-employee directors and PSUs.

 Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share
----------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------------------ -----
Non-vested as of July 3, 2021 3,051,505 $ 65.72
Granted 942,792 79.57

Non-vested as of July 2, 2022 3,065,295 $ 69.10

2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Sysco ESPP permits employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic payroll deductions at a discount of 15% from the closing price on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The total number of shares that may be sold pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed 79,000,000 shares, of which 3,251,703 remained available as of July 2, 2022.

During fiscal 2022, 868,439 shares of Sysco common stock were purchased by the participants, as compared to 1,029,113 shares purchased in fiscal 2021 and 1,089,296 shares purchased in fiscal 2020. The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the ESPP was $12.10, $4.84 and $10.03 per share during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of the stock purchase rights was calculated as the difference between the stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

All Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost included in operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations was $122.3 million, $95.8 million and $42.2 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company’s expense related to its PSUs increased, as the performance metrics are trending above target for awards not yet paid. The total income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements was $19.1 million, $17.8 million and $7.0 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of July 2, 2022, there was $111.5 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Cash received from option exercises and ESPP participation was $128.2 million, $130.4 million and $227.6 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $12.9 million, $11.0 million and $25.4 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract]
INCOME TAXES
 2022 2021 2020
 (In thousands)
U.S. $ 1,642,376 $ 858,179 $ 742,332
Foreign 104,397 (273,451) (448,948)
Total $ 1,746,773 $ 584,728 $ 293,384

The income tax provision for each fiscal year consists of the following:

 2022 2021 2020
---------------------------- -------------- --------- -------- ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
U.S. federal income taxes $ 353,825 $ 158,762 $ 128,576
State and local income taxes 45,502 17,808 8,529
Foreign income taxes (11,322) (116,051) (59,196)
Total $ 388,005 $ 60,519 $ 77,909

The current and deferred components of the income tax provisions for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2022 2021 2020
-------- -------------- --------- --------- ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
Current $ 452,459 $ 218,383 $ 269,226
Deferred (64,454) (157,864) (191,317)
Total $ 388,005 $ 60,519 $ 77,909

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2022 2021 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ - ----- -
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %
State and local income taxes, net of any applicable federal income tax benefit 2.41 2.67 5.69
Foreign income taxes (1.88) (9.99) (2.46)
Uncertain tax positions 0.83 (0.38) (1.44)
Tax benefit of equity-based compensation (0.16) (1.07) (9.77)
Nondeductible impairment charges — — 17.65
Other 0.01 (1.88) (4.12)
Effective income tax rate 22.21 % 10.35 % 26.55 %

The effective tax rate of 22.21% for fiscal 2022 was impacted by (1) state income tax expense of $42.2 million and (2) our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes, which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 10.35% for fiscal 2021 was impacted by (1) the tax benefit resulting from the changes in tax law in the U.K. of $23.2 million, (2) the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation that totaled $15.0 million, and (3) the $7.6 million tax benefit attributable to the sale of the stock of Cake Corporation.

The effective tax rate of 26.55% for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises. Our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes, which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate. Nondeductible asset impairment charges have an unfavorable impact. Included within “Other” is the effect of certain non-deductible expenses in the U.S. jurisdiction as well as the impact of U.S. tax credits, return to accrual adjustments and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------ - -------
 (In thousands)
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $ 652,807 $ 613,325
Pension 71,722 111,084
Receivables 43,108 53,688
Deferred compensation 27,984 28,978
Share-based compensation 30,395 26,498
Inventory 24,394 17,983
Operating lease liabilities 161,684 181,425
Other 89,143 115,428
Deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 1,101,237 1,148,409
Valuation allowances (232,485) (226,626)
Total deferred tax assets 868,752 921,783
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets 379,018 351,758
Excess tax depreciation and basis differences of assets 150,578 148,418
Operating lease assets 161,163 181,425
Other 50,560 34,725
Total deferred tax liabilities 741,319 716,326
Total net deferred tax assets $ 127,433 $ 205,457

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding as of July 2, 2022 expire in fiscal years 2023 through 2042, with some losses having unlimited carryforward periods. The foreign net operating loss carryforward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. As a result of the company’s analysis, it was concluded that, as of July 2, 2022, a valuation allowance of $232.5 million should be established against the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to certain foreign and U.S. state losses. The company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2022 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- - ------
 (In thousands)
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 20,400 $ 23,135
Additions (reductions) for tax positions related to prior years 12,000 (2,735)
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 32,400 $ 20,400

As of July 2, 2022, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $6.2 million. As of July 3, 2021, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $3.0 million. The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material in any year presented. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 2, 2022, approximately $32.3 million of the $32.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 3, 2021, approximately $20.3 million of the $20.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various jurisdictions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions; however, it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to the statute of limitations expiring. Sysco anticipates an immaterial decrease to the reserve within twelve months as a result of lapse of statutes.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2018 and subsequent tax years have statutes of limitations that remain open for audit. As of July 2, 2022, Sysco’s tax returns in the majority of the state and local and material foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2015.

Other

Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest income of its foreign operations, and, as a result, no material accruals have been made with respect to the tax effects of unremitted earnings, including impacts of outside basis differences and withholding taxes. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unremitted earnings prior to the effective date of the act have been subject to U.S. income tax. Any residual tax effects, including foreign withholding taxes, are immaterial to the financial statements.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes reflects income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Sysco has contracts with various third-party service providers to receive information technology services. The services have been committed for periods up to fiscal 2027 and may be extended. As of July 2, 2022, the total remaining cost of the services over that period is expected to be approximately $346.5 million. A portion of this committed amount may be reduced by Sysco utilizing less than estimated resources and can be increased by Sysco utilizing more than estimated resources. Certain agreements allow adjustments for inflation. Sysco may also cancel a portion or all of the services provided subject to termination fees that decrease over time. If Sysco were to terminate all of the services in fiscal 2023, the estimated termination fees incurred in fiscal 2023 would be approximately $22.0 million.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Business and Consolidation Business and ConsolidationSysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions (Sysco or the company), is engaged in the marketing and distribution of a wide range of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. These services are performed for approximately 700,000 customers from 333 distribution facilities located throughout North America and Europe.Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended July 2, 2022 for fiscal 2022, a 53-week year ended July 3, 2021 for fiscal 2021 and a 52-week year ended June 27, 2020 for fiscal 2020. The company will have a 52-week year ending July 1, 2023 for fiscal 2023.The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Sysco and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.
Fiscal period Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended July 2, 2022 for fiscal 2022, a 53-week year ended July 3, 2021 for fiscal 2021 and a 52-week year ended June 27, 2020 for fiscal 2020. The company will have a 52-week year ending July 1, 2023 for fiscal 2023.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash includes cash equivalents such as cash deposits, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, high-quality money market funds and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, which are recorded at fair value.
Accounts Receivable, Less Allowances Accounts Receivable, Less AllowancesAccounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or incentive programs. Sysco determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer and evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses on trade receivables. To calculate an allowance for credit losses, the company estimates uncollectible amounts based on historical loss experience, including those experienced during times of local and regional disasters, current conditions and collection rates, and expectations regarding future losses. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries.The company utilizes arrangements to sell portions of its trade accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions on a non-recourse basis. The arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales. Proceeds from the sales are reported net of negotiated discount and are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the company’s consolidated balance sheets and as cash flows from operating activities in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.
Inventories InventoriesInventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products and lodging products held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Elements of costs include the purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the company’s warehouses and are net of certain cash received from vendors (see “Vendor Consideration”). Inventory balances are adjusted for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. Inventory valuation reserves are estimated based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, current economic conditions and business trends, seasonal demand, future merchandising strategies and the age of our products.
Plant and Equipment Plant and EquipmentCapital additions, improvements and major replacements are classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are incurred. Upon the disposition of an asset, its accumulated depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or loss is reflected in current earnings.
Long-Lived Assets Long-Lived AssetsManagement reviews long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life on an undiscounted basis. For assets held for use, Sysco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured using fair value. Impairment losses for assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived IntangiblesGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes have occurred that would suggest an impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. This annual testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.For fiscal 2022, the company utilized a qualitative assessment for certain reporting units. For the remaining reporting units, Sysco performed a quantitative test using a combination of the income and market approaches. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions. In the annual fiscal 2022 assessment, all reporting units were concluded to have a fair value that exceeded book value by at least 30%.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative Financial InstrumentsAll derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at fair value at their gross values. Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized immediately in the consolidated results of operations, along with the offsetting gain or loss related to the underlying hedged item.Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity from inception of the hedges and are reclassified to the consolidated results of operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item.For net investment hedges, the remeasurement gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Investments in Corporate-Owned Life InsuranceInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) policies are recorded at their cash surrender values as of each balance sheet date. Changes in the cash surrender value during the period are recorded as a gain or loss within operating expenses. Sysco has the ability and intent to hold certain of its COLI policies to maturity; therefore, the company does not record deferred tax balances related to cash surrender value gains or losses for these policies.
Treasury Stock Treasury StockThe company records treasury stock purchases at cost. Shares removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost method.
Foreign Currency Translation Foreign Currency TranslationThe assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).
Revenue Recognition/Shipping and Handling Costs Revenue RecognitionThe company, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, recognizes revenues when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is the point at which control of the promised goods or services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration Sysco expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For the majority of Sysco’s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods have been delivered, as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfers to the customer. The timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment.Sales tax collected from customers is not included in revenue, but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities.

[See Note 5]:
(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and which we believe helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results. We began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 ...

Subsequent five years 1,213,670 75,605

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
---------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.91 % 3.12 %
Discount rate — SERP 4.84 2.91
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.65 1.90
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.00 2.56

As benefit accruals under the SERP and U.K. Retirement Plan are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of July 2, 2022 or July 3, 2021.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs for each fiscal year were:

 2022 2021 2020
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.12 % 2.94 % 3.70 %
Discount rate — SERP 2.91 2.91 3.62
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 1.90 1.60 2.30
Expected rate of return — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.50 4.75 5.00
Expected rate of return — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.30 2.55 4.55
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.56 2.56

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.91% and 3.65%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 4.84%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan expenses are also excluded from the gross return on assets. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various on the plan’s current asset allocation and historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.50% and 4.65%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s reducing the volatility of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. This structure ensures the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio. Such derivative securities have been used to prevent funded status changes due to interest rate changes.
The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of July 2, 2022 is as follows:

U.S. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Growth assets 30 % 28 %
Liability hedging assets 70 72
 100 %

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively managed investment funds. Growth assets include, but are not limited to, equities, alternatives, real estate, and growth fixed income intended to generate investment funds which are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The day-to-day management of the assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan has been delegated by the plan trustee to a fiduciary manager who decides of the investment strategy.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s target investment allocation and actual investment allocation for fiscal 2022 is as follows:

U.K. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Common contractual fund 40 % 45 %
Liability hedging assets 60 55
 100 %

The actual asset allocation differed from the target asset allocation due to market conditions at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily the impact of UK bond yield changes.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets both managed by the solvency manager. The pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, and (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than physical assets. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the retirement plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the trustee and solvency manager ensure diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.
Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s retirement plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 and Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. Equity as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund. Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment   of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

Individually Significant Plans

The following information relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that significant to the company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:
•The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).
•The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary, together with information included in the annual return/reports filed by each plan with the U.S. Department of Labor. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years.
•The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.
•The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge or supplemental contribution was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the yellow, orange or red zone. If the company’s current and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented FIP or RP, then the payment of surcharges or supplemental contributions is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

Total $ 388,005 $ 60,519 $ 77,909

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2022 2021 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ - ----- -
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %
State and local income taxes, net of any applicable federal income tax benefit 2.41 2.67 5.69
Foreign income taxes (1.88) (9.99) (2.46)
Uncertain tax positions 0.83 (0.38) (1.44)
Tax benefit of equity-based compensation (0.16) (1.07) (9.77)
Nondeductible impairment charges — — 17.65
Other 0.01 (1.88) (4.12)
Effective income tax rate 22.21 % 10.35 % 26.55 %

The effective tax rate of 22.21% for fiscal 2022 was impacted by (1) state income tax expense of $42.2 million and (2) our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes, which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 10.35% for fiscal 2021 was impacted by (1) the tax benefit resulting from the changes in tax law in the U.K. of $23.2 million, (2) the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation that totaled $15.0 million, and (3) the $7.6 million tax benefit attributable to the sale of the stock of Cake Corporation.

The effective tax rate of 26.55% for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the tax benefits non-deductible expenses in the U.S. jurisdiction as well as the impact of U.S. tax credits, return to accrual adjustments and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------ - -------
 (In thousands)
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $ 652,807 $ 613,325
Pension 71,722 111,084
Receivables 43,108 53,688
Deferred compensation 27,984 28,978
Share-based compensation 30,395 26,498
Inventory 24,394 17,983
Operating lease liabilities 161,684 181,425
Other 89,143 115,428
Deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 1,101,237 1,148,409
Valuation allowances (232,485) (226,626)
Total deferred tax assets 868,752 921,783
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets 379,018 351,758
Excess tax depreciation and basis differences of assets 150,578 148,418
Operating lease assets 161,163 181,425
Other 50,560 34,725
Total deferred tax liabilities 741,319 716,326
Total net deferred tax assets $ 127,433 $ 205,457

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding as of July 2, 2022 expire in fiscal years 2023 through 2042, with some losses having unlimited carryforward periods. The foreign net operating loss carryforward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2022 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- - ------
 (In thousands)
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 20,400 $ 23,135
Additions (reductions) for tax positions related to prior years 12,000 (2,735)
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 32,400 $ 20,400

As of July 2, 2022, the gross amount of liability benefits was $3.0 million. The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material in any year presented. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the possible change cannot be made.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 2, 2022, approximately $32.3 million of the $32.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 3, 2021, approximately $20.3 million of the $20.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various jurisdictions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease of limitations expiring. Sysco anticipates an immaterial decrease to the reserve within twelve months as a result of lapse of statutes.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2018 and subsequent tax years have the years before 2015.

Other

Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest income of its foreign operations, and, as a result, no material accruals have been made with respect to the tax effects of unremitted to U.S. income tax. Any residual tax effects, including foreign withholding taxes, are immaterial to the financial statements.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

 2027 221,816 14,238
Subsequent five years 1,213,670 75,605

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
---------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.91 % 3.12 %
Discount rate — SERP 4.84 2.91
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.65 1.90
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.00 2.56

As benefit accruals under the SERP and U.K. Retirement Plan are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of July 2, 2022 or July 3, 2021.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs for each fiscal year were:

 2022 2021 2020
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.12 % 2.94 % 3.70 %
Discount rate — SERP 2.91 2.91 3.62
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 1.90 1.60 2.30
Expected rate of return — U.S. Retirement Plan 4.50 4.75 5.00
Expected rate of return — U.K. Retirement Plan 3.30 2.55 4.55
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.56 2.56

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.91% and 3.65%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 4.84%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan expenses are also excluded from the gross return on assets. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various on the plan’s current asset allocation and historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal 2023 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.50% and 4.65%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s reducing the volatility of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. This structure ensures the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio. Such derivative securities have been used to prevent funded status changes due to interest rate changes.
The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of July 2, 2022 is as follows:

U.S. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Growth assets 30 % 28 %
Liability hedging assets 70 72
 100 %

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively managed investment funds. Growth assets include, but are not limited to, equities, alternatives, real estate, and growth fixed income intended to generate investment funds which are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The day-to-day management of the assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan has been delegated by the plan trustee to a fiduciary manager who decides of the investment strategy.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s target investment allocation and actual investment allocation for fiscal 2022 is as follows:

U.K. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Common contractual fund 40 % 45 %
Liability hedging assets 60 55
 100 %

The actual asset allocation differed from the target asset allocation due to market conditions at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily the impact of UK bond yield changes.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets both managed by the solvency manager. The pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, and (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than physical assets. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the retirement plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the trustee and solvency manager ensure diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.
Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s retirement plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 and Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. Equity as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund. Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment   of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.
The following table presents the fair value of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s assets by major asset category as of July 2, 2022:

Individually Significant Plans

The following information relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that significant to the company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:
•The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).
•The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary, together with information included in the annual return/reports filed by each plan with the U.S. Department of Labor. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years.
•The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.
•The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge or supplemental contribution was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the yellow, orange or red zone. If the company’s current and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented FIP or RP, then the payment of surcharges or supplemental contributions is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract]
INCOME TAXES
 2022 2021 2020
 (In thousands)
U.S. $ 1,642,376 $ 858,179 $ 742,332
Foreign 104,397 (273,451) (448,948)
Total $ 1,746,773 $ 584,728 $ 293,384

The income tax provision for each fiscal year consists of the following:

 2022 2021 2020
---------------------------- -------------- --------- -------- ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
U.S. federal income taxes $ 353,825 $ 158,762 $ 128,576
State and local income taxes 45,502 17,808 8,529
Foreign income taxes (11,322) (116,051) (59,196)
Total $ 388,005 $ 60,519 $ 77,909

The current and deferred components of the income tax provisions for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2022 2021 2020
-------- -------------- --------- --------- ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
Current $ 452,459 $ 218,383 $ 269,226
Deferred (64,454) (157,864) (191,317)
Total $ 388,005 $ 60,519 $ 77,909

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2022 2021 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ - ----- -
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %
State and local income taxes, net of any applicable federal income tax benefit 2.41 2.67 5.69
Foreign income taxes (1.88) (9.99) (2.46)
Uncertain tax positions 0.83 (0.38) (1.44)
Tax benefit of equity-based compensation (0.16) (1.07) (9.77)
Nondeductible impairment charges — — 17.65
Other 0.01 (1.88) (4.12)
Effective income tax rate 22.21 % 10.35 % 26.55 %

The effective tax rate of 22.21% for fiscal 2022 was impacted by (1) state income tax expense of $42.2 million and (2) our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes, which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 10.35% for fiscal 2021 was impacted by (1) the tax benefit resulting from the changes in tax law in the U.K. of $23.2 million, (2) the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation that totaled $15.0 million, and (3) the $7.6 million tax benefit attributable to the sale of the stock of Cake Corporation.

The effective tax rate of 26.55% for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the tax benefits non-deductible expenses in the U.S. jurisdiction as well as the impact of U.S. tax credits, return to accrual adjustments and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Jul. 2, 2022 Jul. 3, 2021
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------ - -------
 (In thousands)
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $ 652,807 $ 613,325
Pension 71,722 111,084
Receivables 43,108 53,688
Deferred compensation 27,984 28,978
Share-based compensation 30,395 26,498
Inventory 24,394 17,983
Operating lease liabilities 161,684 181,425
Other 89,143 115,428
Deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 1,101,237 1,148,409
Valuation allowances (232,485) (226,626)
Total deferred tax assets 868,752 921,783
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets 379,018 351,758
Excess tax depreciation and basis differences of assets 150,578 148,418
Operating lease assets 161,163 181,425
Other 50,560 34,725
Total deferred tax liabilities 741,319 716,326
Total net deferred tax assets $ 127,433 $ 205,457

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding as of July 2, 2022 expire in fiscal years 2023 through 2042, with some losses having unlimited carryforward periods. The foreign net operating loss carryforward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2022 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- - ------
 (In thousands)
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 20,400 $ 23,135
Additions (reductions) for tax positions related to prior years 12,000 (2,735)
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 32,400 $ 20,400

As of July 2, 2022, the gross amount of liability benefits was $3.0 million. The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material in any year presented. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the possible change cannot be made.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 2, 2022, approximately $32.3 million of the $32.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 3, 2021, approximately $20.3 million of the $20.4 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various jurisdictions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease of limitations expiring. Sysco anticipates an immaterial decrease to the reserve within twelve months as a result of lapse of statutes.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2018 and subsequent tax years have the years before 2015.

Other

Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest income of its foreign operations, and, as a result, no material accruals have been made with respect to the tax effects of unremitted to U.S. income tax. Any residual tax effects, including foreign withholding taxes, are immaterial to the financial statements.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
