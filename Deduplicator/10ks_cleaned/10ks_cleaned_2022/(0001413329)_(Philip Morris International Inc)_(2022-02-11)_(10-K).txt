Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Financial Review in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.

 Debt and Liquidity

We define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating. As part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI, and the collateral is returned to the bank. For 2021 and 2020, the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material.

In August 2021, we published a business transformation-linked financing framework (“Framework”), which integrates the company’s smoke-free transformation into its financing strategy. The Framework outlines the guidelines that we will follow in issuing business transformation-linked financing instruments in the debt capital and loan markets, which may include public notes offerings, private placements, loans, and other relevant financing instruments.

Credit Ratings – The cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. At February 10, 2022, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:

----------------- ---------- --------- -------
 Short-term Long-term Outlook
Moody’s P-1 A2 Stable
Standard & Poor’s A-1 A Stable
Fitch F1 A Stable

Credit Facilities – On January 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of our $1.8 billion 364-day revolving credit facility from February 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023.

At February 10, 2022, our committed credit facilities were as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---
(in billions)
Type CommittedCreditFacilities
364-day revolving credit, expiring January 31, 2023 $ 1.8
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring February 10, 2026(1) 2.0
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring September 29, 2026(2) 2.5
Total facilities $ 6.3

(1) On January 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2022, to amend and extend the term of our $2.0 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2026 to February 10, 2027, in the amount of $1.9 billion.
(2) Includes business transformation-linked pricing adjustments that may result in the reduction or increase in both the interest rate and commitment fee under the credit agreement if PMI achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets based on its business transformation goals.

At February 10, 2022, there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing. Subject to market conditions, PMI currently expects to request a further extension of the terms of its $2.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility for an additional one-year period, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant revolving credit facility agreement.

All banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.

These facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral. We expect to continue to meet our covenants.

In addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, certain of our subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs. These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, are for the sole use of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $225 million at December 31, 2021, and $244 million at December 31, 2020.

Commercial Paper Program – We continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. and in Europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion. At December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2021 and 2020 was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Sale of Accounts Receivable – To mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management, we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow us to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse. The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. We sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and nonservicing.

Our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions. The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $0.9 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 18. Sale of Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements.

Debt – Our total debt was $27.8 billion at December 31, 2021, and $31.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature. The weighted-average all-in financing cost of our total debt was 2.4% in 2021 and 2020. For further details,

61

including the fair value of our debt, see Item 8, Note 7. Indebtedness. The amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

On February 11, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we may from time to time sell debt securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities over a three-year period.

During 2021, we had no public debt issuances.

The weighted-average time to maturity of our long-term debt was approximately 10 years at the end of 2021 and 2020.

Cash Requirements – At December 31, 2021, our material short-term and long-term cash requirements for various contractual obligations and commitments primarily consisted of the following:
•principal payments related to long-term debt and the associated interest payments. For further details, see Item 8, Note 7. Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements;
•accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet (primarily short-term in nature);
•purchase obligations for inventory and production costs to be utilized in the normal course of business such as raw materials, electronic devices, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution, as well as capital expenditures. These purchase obligations are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2022 and approximately $1.6 billion for years beyond;
•operating lease liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, which were included in our consolidated balance sheets. For further details, see Item 8, Note 21. Leases to our consolidated financial statements; and
•other long-term liabilities mainly related to transition tax. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

We utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy. Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs. We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.

•Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees, and cash requirements discussed above.

Guarantees – At December 31, 2021, we have guarantees of our own performance, which are primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. These guarantees have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on PMI’s liquidity. In October 2020, we guaranteed an obligation for an equity method investee. For further details, see Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.

 Equity and Dividends

We discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2021, in Item 8, Note 9. Stock Plans to our consolidated financial statements.

During 2020 and the first six months of 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program. On June 11, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $7 billion, with target spending of $5 billion to $7 billion over a three-year period. On July 22, 2021, we began repurchasing shares under this new share repurchase program. From July 22, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $785 million.

Dividends paid in 2021 were $7.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 4.2% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per common share. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $5.00 per common share.

Market Risk

 Counterparty Risk - We predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.

We continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.

 Derivative Financial Instruments - We operate in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure. We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

See Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.

 Value at Risk - We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

The computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a "parametric delta-gamma" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.

------------------------- ------------------- ------- ------ ----
 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) AtDecember 31, 2021 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $24 $36 $45 $24

Interest rates $217 $200 $217 $179

 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) AtDecember 31, 2020 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $59 $78 $136 $54

Interest rates $180 $445 $1,146 $180

The significant year-over-year decrease in "average" and "high" impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to an increase in interest rate and foreign currency volatility during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We

63

cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position.

Contingencies

See Item 3 and Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "aspires," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "aims," "goals," "targets," "forecasts" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Business Environment of this section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider this discussion of potential risks or uncertainties to be complete. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

Market Risk

 Counterparty Risk - We predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.

We continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.

 Derivative Financial Instruments - We operate in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

See Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.

 Value at Risk - We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates.
