Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 37

As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.

Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market
Our three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

Revenues
The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021:
Geographic Markets
•North America revenues increased 23% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Software & Platforms. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.
•Europe revenues increased 29% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.

Cost of Services
Cost of services for fiscal 2022 increased $7,724 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 68.0% over 67.6% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2022 decreased to 32.0% from 32.4% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2022 increased $820 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% from 10.5% during this period. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs for fiscal 2022 increased $772 million, or 22%, over fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.9% over 6.8% during this period.
Operating Income and Operating Margin
Operating income for fiscal 2022 increased $1,746 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2021. Operating margin for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.
Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows:

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021:
•North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
•Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.
•Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Other Income (Expense), net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Loss on Disposition of Russia Business
We recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.
Income Tax Expense
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 24.0%, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For

additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $10.71 for fiscal 2022, including a $0.15 negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia, compared with $9.16 for fiscal 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $8.80 for fiscal 2021. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors:

Results of Operations for Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2020 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

ACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-K Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 41

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;
•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;
•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or
•develop new services and solutions.
As of August 31, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents were $7.9 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021.
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------ ------- ------ ---- ------- - ----- ----- - ----
 Fiscal Change
(in millions of U.S. dollars) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 9,541 $ 8,975 $ 566
Investing activities (4,261) (4,310) 49
Financing activities (5,311) (4,926) (385)
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (248) 14 (262)
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (278) $ (247) $ (31)

Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The $566 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including receivables from clients and contract assets.
Investing activities: The $49 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Financing activities: The $385 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
Share Purchases and Redemptions
We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Obligations and Commitments
As of August 31, 2022, we had commitments of $2.8 billion related to cloud hosting arrangements, software subscriptions, information technology services and other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Payments under these commitments are estimated to be made as follows:

Less than 1 year $ 774
1-3 years 931
3-5 years 665

For information about borrowing facilities and leases, see Note 10 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) and Note 8 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The 27 net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. 80 ADOBE INC.

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 37

As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.

Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market
Our three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, concentrations and locations of their businesses.
While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
