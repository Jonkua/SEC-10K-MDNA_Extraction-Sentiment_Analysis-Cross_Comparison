Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Trends in our Pay-TV Segment – Programming” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
We believe that the availability and extent of programming, including unique programming services such as foreign language, sports programming and original content, and other value-added services such as access to video via mobile devices, continue to be significant factors in consumers’ choice among pay-TV providers. Other pay-TV providers may have more successfully marketed and promoted their programming packages and value-added services and may also be better equipped and have greater resources to increase their programming offerings and value-added services to respond to increasing consumer demand. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in infrastructure to respond to competitive pressure to deliver enhanced programming and other value-added services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with offerings from other pay-TV providers.
​
Furthermore, this increasingly competitive environment may require us to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn.  Increasingly, we must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from our competitors’ existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. In addition, because other pay-TV providers may be seeking to attract a greater proportion of their new subscribers from our existing subscriber base, we may be required to increase retention spending and/or provide greater discounts or credits to acquire and retain subscribers who may spend less on our services. Our SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers. Accordingly, an increase in SLING TV subscribers has a negative impact on our Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (“Pay-TV ARPU”). If our Pay-TV ARPU decreases or does not increase commensurate with increases in programming or other costs, our margins may be reduced and the long-term value of a subscriber would then decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

​
In addition, as a result of this increased competitive environment and the maturation of the pay-TV industry, future growth opportunities of our DISH TV business may be limited and our margins may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by stricter subscriber acquisition policies (including a focus on attaining higher quality subscribers) and increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. In addition, we face increased competitive pressures from content providers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet. These content providers and other companies, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunication companies, are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings. There can be no assurance that our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, net DISH TV subscriber additions, and DISH TV churn rate will not continue to be negatively impacted and that the pace of such negative impact will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
​
Changing consumer behavior and new technologies in our Pay-TV business may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us.
​
New technologies, products and services are driving rapid changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services. In particular, through technological advancements and with the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of video content has become available through online content providers for users to stream and view on their personal computers, televisions, phones, tablets, videogame consoles, and other devices, in some cases without a fee required to access the content. While our subscribers can use their traditional video subscription to access mobile programming, an increasing number of subscribers are also using mobile devices as the sole means of viewing video, and an increasing number of non-traditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy that demand. For example, these technological advancements, changes in consumer behavior, and the increasing number of choices available to consumers regarding the means by which consumers obtain video content may cause DISH TV subscribers to disconnect our services (“cord cutting”), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (“cord shaving”) or elect to purchase through online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies. These technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior and/or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to such changes, could reduce our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and increase our subscriber churn rate, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
​
New technologies could also create new competitors for us. For instance, we face increasing consumer demand for the delivery of digital video services via the Internet. We expect to continue to face increased competition from companies who use the Internet to deliver digital video services as the speed and quality of broadband and wireless networks continue to improve.
​
We face certain risks competing in the wireless services industry and operating a facilities-based wireless services business.
​
As a result of the recent Boost Mobile, Ting Mobile and Republic Wireless acquisitions, among others, we have entered the retail wireless business. We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses. We plan to commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of our 5G Network Deployment. A wireless services business presents certain risks. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations and financial condition.
​

​
 ● The wireless services industry is competitive. We have limited experience in the wireless services industry, which is a competitive industry with increasing subscriber demands for data services that require increasing capital resources to maintain a robust network. The wireless services industry has incumbent and established competitors such as Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile with substantial market share. These companies have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us, and have existing cost and operational advantages that we lack. Market saturation is expected to continue to cause subscriber growth rates in the wireless services industry to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for subscribers. As the industry matures, competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of wireless services. Furthermore, the cost of attracting a new subscriber is generally higher than the cost associated with retaining an existing subscriber. In addition, we face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings. Wireless mobile video offerings have become more prevalent in the marketplace as wireless telecommunications providers have expanded the fourth generation of wireless communications and are entering the fifth generation. As previously noted, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services. Such companies may be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize their increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price they pay for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us; thwart our ability to compete in the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings. See “Item 1. Business – Overview – Business Strategy Wireless” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Wireless – Retail Wireless” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​
 ● Our ability to compete effectively in the wireless services industry would be dependent on a number of factors. Our ability to compete effectively in the wireless services industry would depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage; the pricing of our products and services; the quality of subscriber service; our development of new and enhanced products and services; the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels; our ability to predict and adapt to future changes in technologies and changes in consumer demands; and capital resources. It would also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including, among others, new technologies and business models, products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in consumer preferences, the demand for and usage of data, video and other voice and non-voice services, demographic trends, economic conditions, and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by competitors. It may be difficult for us to differentiate our products and services from other competitors in the industry, which may limit our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Our success also may depend on our ability to access and deploy adequate spectrum, deploy new technologies and offer attractive services to subscribers. For example, we may not be able to obtain and offer certain technologies, features or services that are subject to competitor patents or other exclusive arrangements.

​
 ● We depend on third parties to provide us with infrastructure and products and services. We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with infrastructure, equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment that we would need in order to operate a wireless services business and provide products and services to our subscribers. For example, handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or services on a timely basis or fail to meet performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when expected by our subscribers. Any difficulties experienced with these suppliers and vendors could result in additional expense and/or delays in operating our wireless services. Our efforts involve significant expense and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, among other things, equipment choices, network deployment and management, and service offerings. In addition, these suppliers and vendors may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.

​

​
 ● Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to government regulation. Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities. These governmental authorities could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects, making it more difficult and/or expensive to complete our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses or acquire additional licenses. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal and international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal or revocation based on certain factors depending on the license including, among others, public interest considerations, level and quality of services and/or operations provided by the licensee, frequency and duration of any interruptions or outages of services and/or operations provided by the licensee, and the extent to which service is provided to, and/or operation is provided in, rural areas and tribal lands. There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed or that we will be able to obtain additional licenses. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. In addition, the FCC uses its transactional “spectrum screen” to identify prospective wireless transactions that may require additional competitive scrutiny. If a proposed transaction would exceed the spectrum screen threshold, the FCC undertakes a more detailed analysis of relevant market conditions in the impacted geographic areas to determine whether the transaction would reduce competition without offsetting public benefits. If a proposed spectrum acquisition exceeds the spectrum screen trigger, such additional review could extend the duration of the regulatory review process and there can be no assurance that such proposed spectrum acquisition would ultimately be completed, in whole or in part.

​
Our pay-TV competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and/or offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us.
​
The cost of programming represents the largest percentage of our overall Pay-TV costs. Certain of our competitors own directly or are affiliated with companies that own programming content that may enable them to obtain lower programming costs or offer exclusive programming that may be attractive to prospective subscribers. Unlike our larger cable and satellite competitors, some of which also provide internet or broadband based pay-TV services, we have not made significant investments in programming providers. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to obtain access to such programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. See “Changes in the Cable Act, and/or the rules of the FCC that implement the Cable Act, may limit our ability to access programming from cable-affiliated programmers at nondiscriminatory rates,” below and “Item 1. Business – Government Regulations – FCC Regulations Governing our Pay-TV Operations – Cable Act and Program Access” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Through the MNSA and NSA, we depend primarily on T-Mobile as well as AT&T, respectively, in providing network services to our retail Wireless subscribers, and any system failure in the wireless networks, interruption in the network services (including the shutdown of T-Mobile’s CDMA Network on March 31, 2022), and/or the termination of the MNSA or NSA could negatively impact our subscriber activations, our subscriber churn rate and our subscriber base, which in turn could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
As we offer retail wireless services and move forward with our 5G Network Deployment, we currently depend primarily on T-Mobile as well as AT&T to provide us with network services pursuant to the MNSA and NSA, respectively. We rely on T-Mobile and AT&T to maintain their wireless facilities and government authorizations and to comply with government policies and regulations. If T-Mobile or AT&T fails to do so our subscriber activations and churn rate could be negatively impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

​

Table of Contents
​

​
Furthermore, T-Mobile provided notice that it intends to shutdown the CDMA Network on March 31, 2022. A substantial portion of our retail Wireless subscribers currently receive services through T-Mobile’s CDMA Network. The shutdown on this timeframe will require subscribers to obtain a new device, a new SIM card or receive a software download in order to continue receiving wireless services from us under the MNSA.  These required measures are challenging to implement and could result in, among other things, a significant increase in our churn rate and negative impact to our retail Wireless subscriber base.
​
We have incurred substantial costs to implement these measures, including for the procurement of replacement devices, but there are many risks, including the procurement of an adequate number of replacement devices in a timely fashion. As a result, there can be no assurance that the implementation of these measures will be successful in reducing or controlling subscriber churn.
​
Moreover, these measures along with our associated subscriber communications could cause confusion and dissatisfaction within our retail Wireless subscriber base, which could result in significant subscriber churn.  Consequently, the circumstances surrounding T-Mobile’s shutdown of its CDMA Network and our efforts in responding to such shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Other risks related to T-Mobile’s and AT&T’s wireless networks and infrastructure include, but are not limited to: major equipment failures, breaches of network or information technology security that affect their wireless networks, including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks or breaches, transport facilities, communications switches, routers, microwave links, cell sites or other equipment, power surges or outages, software defects and disruptions beyond T-Mobile’s and AT&T’s control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. Any impact on T-Mobile’s and/or AT&T’s wireless network could disrupt our operations, require significant resources, result in a loss of retail wireless subscribers or impair our ability to attract new retail wireless subscribers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Delays or failure to add network capacity, or increased costs of adding capacity or operating the network, could limit our ability to increase our subscriber base, limit our ability to increase our revenues, or cause a deterioration of our operating margin.
​
Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travels across their networks could adversely impact our Pay-TV business.
​
With respect to our Pay-TV business, we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our SLING TV services and certain DISH TV functionality through the Internet. If network operators block, restrict, slow-down or throttle or otherwise impair access to our services over their networks, our business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our SLING TV subscriber count could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of Internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our SLING TV business could be negatively impacted.
​
In addition, many network operators that provide consumers with broadband service also provide these consumers with video programming, and these network operators may have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. These risks may be exacerbated to the extent network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data, including, for example, by offering wireless subscribers access to owned video content over the Internet without counting against a subscriber’s monthly data caps (“zero rating”), which may give an unfair advantage to the network operator’s own video content.
​
We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our business that may result from changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travels across their networks.

​
Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our business.
​
Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by economic weakness and uncertainty, which could result in the following:
 ● Fewer subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn rate. We could face fewer subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn rate due to, among other things: (i) certain economic factors that impact consumers, including, among others, rising interest rates, a potential downturn in the housing market in the United States (including a decline in housing starts) and higher unemployment, which could lead to a lack of consumer confidence and lower discretionary spending; (ii) increased price competition for our products and services; and (iii) the potential loss of independent third-party retailers, who generate a meaningful percentage of our gross new DISH TV and retail Wireless subscriber activations, because many of them are small businesses that are more susceptible to the negative effects of economic weakness. In particular, our DISH TV churn rate and retail Wireless churn rate may increase with respect to subscribers who purchase our lower tier programming packages and wireless services, and who may be more sensitive to economic weakness, including, among others, our pay-in-advance subscribers.

 ● Higher subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our profits may be adversely affected by increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs necessary to attract and retain subscribers during a period of economic weakness.

​
Operational and Service Delivery Risks
​
Any deterioration in our operational performance and subscriber satisfaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
If our operational performance and subscriber satisfaction with respect to either or both of our Pay-TV or wireless services were to deteriorate, we may experience a decrease in subscriber activations and an increase in our subscriber churn rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center, in-home service operations and Retail Wireless operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve subscriber satisfaction, reduce subscriber churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot, however, be certain that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance, and if unsuccessful, we may have to incur higher costs to improve our operational performance. While we believe that such costs will be outweighed by longer-term benefits, there can be no assurance when or if we will realize these benefits at all.
​
If our subscriber activations decrease, or if our subscriber churn rate, subscriber acquisition costs or retention costs increase, our financial performance will be adversely affected.
​
We may incur increased costs to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers to either or both of our Pay-TV or wireless services. For example, with respect to our Pay-TV business, our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, net DISH TV subscriber additions, and DISH TV churn rate continue to be negatively impacted by stricter subscriber acquisition and retention policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. In addition, our subscriber acquisition costs could increase as a result of increased spending for advertising and, with respect to our DISH TV services, the installation of more DVR receivers, which are generally more expensive than other receivers. Retention costs with respect to our DISH TV services may be driven higher by increased upgrades of existing subscribers’ equipment to DVR receivers.
​
For our retail wireless business, we are currently in the process of integrating our Retail Wireless operations and making certain operational changes to enhance profitability. We are working to ensure that the subscribers we acquire and retain are profitable under our MVNO economics. As an example, certain subscribers that use high amounts of data, may be profitable for an MNO, but are not profitable under an MNVO. This has caused our net retail Wireless subscriber additions to be negatively impacted.
​

Table of Contents
​

Although we expect to continue to incur expenses, such as providing retention credits and other subscriber acquisition and retention expenses, to attract and retain subscribers, there can be no assurance that our efforts will generate new subscribers or result in a lower churn rate. Our subscriber acquisition costs and our subscriber retention costs can vary significantly from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow. Any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
With respect to our Pay-TV business, programming expenses are increasing, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
​
Our programming costs represent a significant component of our total expense and we expect these costs to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. The pay-TV industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially local broadcast channels and sports programming. In addition, certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. These factors may be exacerbated by the increasing trend of consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.
​
When offering new programming, or upon expiration of existing contracts, programming suppliers have historically attempted to increase the rates that they charge us for programming. We expect this practice to continue, which, if successful, would increase our programming costs. In addition, our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to our subscribers through additional delivery services, such as SLING TV. As a result, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms. Alternatively, to attempt to mitigate the effect of price increases or for other reasons, we may elect not to carry or may be unable to carry certain channels, which could adversely affect our net Pay-TV subscriber additions.
​
In addition, increases in programming costs cause us to increase the rates that we charge our Pay-TV subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Therefore, we may be unable to pass increased programming costs on to our subscribers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our Pay-TV subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to certain programming, our Pay-TV subscriber activations and our subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted.
​
We depend on third parties to provide us with programming services. Our programming agreements have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to several years and contain various renewal, expiration and/or termination provisions. We may not be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all, and these agreements may be terminated prior to expiration of their original term.
​
In recent years, negotiations over programming carriage contracts generally remain contentious, and certain programmers have, in the past, limited our access to their programming in connection with those negotiations and the scheduled expiration of their programming carriage contracts with us. In recent years, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers.
​
We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses.
​
​

Table of Contents
​

We typically have a few programming contracts with major content providers up for renewal each year and if we are unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties terminate the agreements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In addition, failure to obtain access to certain programming or loss of access to programming, particularly programming provided by major content providers and/or programming popular with our subscribers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions.
​
Our programming signals in our Pay-TV business are subject to theft, and we are vulnerable to other forms of fraud that could require significant expenditures to remedy. Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors’ signals could, in addition to reducing gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, also cause our DISH TV churn rate to increase.
​
We may not be able to obtain necessary retransmission consent agreements at acceptable rates, or at all, from local network stations.
​
The Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network stations that do not elect “must carry” status, as required by the Communications Act. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals. While we have generally been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, from time to time there are stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement, resulting in the removal of their channels primarily from our DISH TV lineup. There can be no assurance that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms, or at all, upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term. In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations. These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming. Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, including, without limitation, those caused by cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, could disrupt or harm our business.
​
The capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) and communications systems, or those of third parties that we use in our operations, are important to the operation of our businesses, which would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber-attacks. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include, among other things, the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of developmental resources.
​
We rely on certain third parties for developing key components of our information technology and communications systems and ongoing service, all of which affect our Pay-TV services and wireless services. Some of our key systems and operations, including those supplied by third-party providers, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations, interrupt our services, result in significant financial expenditures and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our services, retain our current subscribers and attract new Pay-TV and Wireless subscribers and complete our 5G Network Deployment.
​

​

​
In addition, although we take protective measures designed to secure our information technology systems and endeavor to modify such protective measures as circumstances warrant, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems, or those of third parties that we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including, without limitation, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks and other malicious activities such as unauthorized access, physical or electronic break-ins, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, computer denial of service attacks and other events that could disrupt or harm our business. These protective measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may themselves be vulnerable to hacking, malfeasance, system error or other irregularities.
​
For example, certain parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or subscribers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. In addition, third-party providers of some of our key systems may also experience interruptions to their information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. We may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our subscribers, personnel and vendors, and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business. If one or more of such interruptions or failures occur to us or our third-party providers, it potentially could jeopardize such information and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our or our third-party providers’ information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in lawsuits, government claims, investigations or proceedings, significant losses or reputational damage. Due to the fast-moving pace of technology, it may be difficult to detect, contain and remediate every such event.
​
We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to financial losses. Furthermore, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all expenses related to such activities or all types of claims that may arise.
​
As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, the potential liability associated with information-related risks is increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle personal subscriber data. The occurrence of any network or information system related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant incidents could result in a disruption of our operations, subscriber dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or a loss of subscribers and revenues.
​
Our failure to effectively invest in, introduce, and implement new competitive products and services could cause our products and services to become obsolete and could negatively impact our business.
​
Technology in the pay-TV and wireless industries changes rapidly as new technologies are developed, which could cause our products and services to become obsolete. We and our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments. Our operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to introduce new products and services, to upgrade existing products and services on a timely basis, and to reduce costs of our existing products and services. We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner.
​
The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment. The success of new product and service development depends on many factors, including among others, the following:
 ● difficulties and delays in the development, production, timely completion, testing and marketing of products and services;

 ● the cost of the products and services;

 ● proper identification of subscriber need and subscriber acceptance of products and services;

 ● the development of, approval of and compliance with industry standards;

 ● the amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies; and

 ● the ability to differentiate our products and services and compete with other companies in the same markets.

​

31

Table of Contents
​

If the new technologies on which we focus our research and development investments fail to achieve acceptance in the marketplace, our competitive position could be negatively impacted, causing a reduction in our revenues and earnings. For example, our competitors could use proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior. In addition, delays in the delivery of components or other unforeseen problems associated with our technology may occur that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new products and services and remain competitive. Further, after we have incurred substantial costs, one or more of the products or services under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners, could become obsolete prior to it being widely adopted.
​
If our products and services are not competitive, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. Our products and services may also experience quality problems, including outages and service slowdowns, from time to time. If the quality of our products and services do not meet our subscribers’ expectations, then our business, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.
​
We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.
​
Historically, we have contracted with and rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, security access devices, and many components that we provide to subscribers in order to deliver our Pay-TV or wireless services. We also rely on a limited number of vendors to supply our wireless devices and wireless network equipment that we resell to subscribers. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are no longer in business, are experiencing shortages or supply chain issues or discontinue a certain product or service we need, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
​
We have experienced in the past and may continue to experience shortages driven by raw material availability (which may be negatively impacted by, among other things, trade protection policies such as tariffs and or/escalating trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia), manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters, logistical delays and significant changes in the financial or business conditions of its suppliers that negatively impact our operations.
​
While alternative sources for these products and services exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to timely deliver our products to our subscribers or operate our business. Furthermore, our vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties, which could require us to make substantial additional investments.
​
We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a meaningful percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations.
​
While we offer products and services through direct sales channels, a meaningful percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations are generated through independent third parties such as small retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies. Most of our independent third-party retailers are not exclusive to us and some of our independent third-party retailers may favor our competitors’ products and services over ours based on the relative financial arrangements associated with marketing our products and services and those of our competitors. Furthermore, most of these independent third-party retailers are significantly smaller than we are and may be more susceptible to economic weaknesses that make it more difficult for them to operate profitably. Because our independent third-party retailers receive most of their incentive value at activation and not over an extended period of time, our interests may not always be aligned with our independent third-party retailers. It may be difficult to better align our interests with our independent third-party retailers because of their capital and liquidity constraints. Loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our subscriber base and certain of our other key operating metrics because we may not be able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels.

We have limited satellite capacity and failures or reduced capacity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.
​
Our ability to earn revenue from our DISH TV services depends on the usefulness of our owned and leased satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite’s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion. Generally, the minimum design life of each of our owned and leased satellites ranges from 12 to 15 years. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of any of these satellites. Our operating results could be adversely affected if the useful life of any of our owned or leased satellites were significantly shorter than the minimum design life.
​
Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, which have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as manufacturing defects, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.
​
In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming. A relocation would require FCC approval, and we cannot be certain that we could obtain such FCC approval. If we choose to use a satellite in this manner, such use could adversely affect our ability to satisfy certain operational conditions associated with our authorizations and could result in the loss of such authorizations, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.
​
From time to time, new satellites need to be built and launched. Satellite construction and launch is subject to significant risks, including, among others, construction and launch delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement.
​
Other than in certain limited circumstances, we do not carry commercial in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites we own, and generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. If one or more of our owned in-orbit satellites fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges.
​
We may have potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar due to our common ownership and management.
​
Questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between EchoStar and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between EchoStar and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:
​
 ● Cross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. We have certain overlap in directors and executive officers with EchoStar. These individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. Currently, our Board of Directors and executive officers includes Charles W. Ergen, who serves as the Chairman of EchoStar and our Chairman. Mr. Ergen also has fiduciary duties to EchoStar’s shareholders. For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we or EchoStar look at acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, certain of our directors and officers own EchoStar stock. Mr. Ergen beneficially owns approximately 58.0% of EchoStar’s total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B common stock into Class A common stock) and controls approximately 92.9% of the voting power of EchoStar. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and EchoStar. Furthermore, Mr. Ergen is employed by both us and EchoStar.

​

 ● Intercompany agreements with EchoStar. In connection with and following the Spin-off, Share Exchange Agreement and Master Transaction Agreement (as defined in Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we and EchoStar have entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we obtain certain products, services and rights from EchoStar, EchoStar obtains certain products, services and rights from us, and we and EchoStar have indemnified each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. See Note 20 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar. The terms of certain of these agreements were established while EchoStar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and were not the result of arm’s length negotiations. The allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between EchoStar and us under the separation and other intercompany agreements we entered into with EchoStar, in connection with the Spin-off, may have been different if agreed to by two unaffiliated parties. Had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties, their terms may have been more favorable, or less favorable, to us. In addition, conflicts could arise between us and EchoStar in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of these existing agreements.

​
 ● Additional intercompany transactions. EchoStar and its subsidiaries have and may continue to enter into transactions with us and our subsidiaries. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between EchoStar and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of a committee of the non-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained between unaffiliated parties.

​
 ● Business opportunities. We have historically retained, and in the future may acquire, interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by EchoStar. We may also compete with EchoStar when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites.

​
We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. We do not have agreements with EchoStar that would prevent either company from competing with the other.
​
We rely on highly skilled personnel for our business, and any inability to hire and retain key personnel or hire qualified personnel may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
We believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and certain other executives. The loss of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although all of our executives have executed agreements with certain non-competition restrictions that apply if they leave us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them. Mr. Ergen also serves as the Chairman of EchoStar. To the extent our officers are performing services for EchoStar, this may divert their time and attention away from our business and may therefore adversely affect our business.
​
In addition, technological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees. If we are unable to attract and retain appropriately technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we believe that our wireless business, including our ability to meet build-out requirements, is dependent on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain a team of highly skilled personnel with knowledge of the wireless industry.  Our wireless business will be adversely affected if we fail to effectively identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge of the wireless industry.

Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks
​
We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets, and we may be unable to realize a return on these assets.
​
We have directly invested approximately $20 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses (including the 3.45-3.55 GHz band licenses purchased in the first quarter of 2022). See Note 2 and Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information regarding these licenses, including certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements.
​
We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, complete our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we complete our 5G Network Deployment we will incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to complete our 5G Network Deployment and to compete with other wireless service providers.
​
There is no assurance that the FCC will find our 5G Network Deployment sufficient to meet the build-out requirements to which our wireless spectrum licenses are subject. Failure to comply with FCC build-out requirements and/or renewal requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. The revocation of a material portion of our wireless spectrum licenses would have a significant material adverse effect on our 5G Network Deployment and our future business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
In addition, we may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.
​
Furthermore, the fair values of wireless spectrum licenses may vary significantly in the future. In particular, valuation swings could occur if:
​
 ● consolidation in the wireless industry allows or requires wireless carriers to sell significant portions of their wireless spectrum holdings, which could in turn reduce the value of our spectrum holdings;

 ● a sale of spectrum by one or more wireless providers occurs;

 ● the FCC pursues certain policies designed to increase the number of wireless spectrum licenses available in each of our markets; or

 ● the FCC conducts additional wireless spectrum auctions.

​
If the fair value of our wireless spectrum licenses were to decline significantly, the value of these licenses could be subject to impairment charges. We assess potential impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more often if indicators of impairment arise to determine whether there is evidence that indicate an impairment condition may exist.
​
We capitalize our interest expense associated with the acquisition or construction of certain assets, including, among other things, our wireless spectrum licenses. As the carrying amount of these licenses exceeds the carrying value of our long-term debt, materially all of our interest expense is being capitalized. This capitalized interest increases the carrying amount of these licenses for purposes of impairment testing, under which we consider whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeds the carrying amount of these licenses. An increase in the carrying amount of these licenses combined with other changes in circumstances and/or market conditions could result in an increased risk of an impairment of these licenses in the future and an impairment of these assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

​
We have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses, and we may be unable to obtain a profitable return on these investments.
​
During 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we initially made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless (collectively, the “Northstar Entities”), and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless (collectively, the “SNR Entities”), respectively. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless each participated in Auction 97 for the purpose of acquiring certain AWS-3 licenses, and were granted 261 and 244 AWS-3 Licenses (the “AWS-3 Licenses”), respectively, which are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. On November 23, 2020, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order on Remand, FCC 20-160, that found that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless are not eligible for bidding credits based on the FCC’s determination that they remain under DISH Network’s de facto control.  Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless have appealed the FCC’s order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
​
See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information regarding these investments, including the operative agreements governing the investments, the FCC’s determination of our de facto control, the potential re-auction payments for certain AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC, and the build-out requirements for the AWS-3 Licenses.
​
We do not own or control the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses nor do we control the Northstar Entities or the SNR Entities. We do not have a right to require Northstar Manager or SNR Management to sell their respective ownership interests in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco to us. Northstar Manager, as the sole manager of Northstar Spectrum, and SNR Management, as the sole manager of SNR Holdco, will have the exclusive right and power to manage, operate and control Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, subject to certain limited protective provisions for the benefit of American II and American III, respectively. Northstar Manager and SNR Management will have the ability, but not the obligation, to require Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, to purchase Northstar Manager’s and SNR Management’s ownership interests in those respective entities. The First Northstar Put Window closed in the first quarter of 2021. The Second Northstar Put Window is currently open and expires on July 24, 2022. The First SNR Put Window closed in the first quarter of 2021. On November 15, 2021, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary American III received notice that SNR Management is exercising the SNR Put Right effective as of November 15, 2021. Thus, we cannot be certain that the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses will be developed in a manner fully consistent with our current or future business plans.
​
In addition, we may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to the AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential re-auction payments for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out and integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential re-auction payments, any loans, equity contributions or partnerships could vary significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Furthermore, litigation surrounding designated entity structures, increased regulatory scrutiny or third party or government lawsuits with respect to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities could result in fines, and in certain cases, license revocation and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

​
We may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful, and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.
​
Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy or otherwise invest in other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. To pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex. We may not be able to identify or complete attractive acquisition or investment opportunities due to, among other things, the intense competition for these transactions. If we are not able to identify and complete such acquisition or investment opportunities, our future results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
​
We may be unable to obtain in the anticipated timeframe, or at all, any regulatory approvals required to complete proposed acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Furthermore, the conditions imposed for obtaining any necessary approvals could delay the completion of such transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. We may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:
​
 ● the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;

​
 ● possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;

​
 ● a high degree of risk inherent in these transactions, which could become substantial over time, and higher exposure to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful;

​
 ● our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction; and

​
 ● the risks associated with complying with contractual provisions and regulations applicable to the acquired business, which may cause us to incur substantial expenses.

​
In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, the integration process may strain our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures.
​
New acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing business. To pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
​
In addition to committing capital to complete the acquisitions, substantial capital may be required to operate the acquired businesses following their acquisition. These acquisitions may result in significant financial losses if the intended objectives of the transactions are not achieved. Some of the businesses that we have acquired have experienced significant operating and financial challenges in their recent history, which in some cases resulted in these businesses commencing bankruptcy proceedings prior to our acquisition. We may acquire similar businesses in the future.
​
There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully address the challenges and risks encountered by these businesses following their acquisition. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges and risks, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations may suffer.

​
We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt.
​
As of December 31, 2021, our total long-term debt and finance lease obligations, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was $21.417 billion. Our debt levels could have significant consequences, including, but not limited to,
 ● making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations;

 ● a dilutive effect on our outstanding equity capital or future earnings;

 ● increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including changes in interest rates;

 ● requiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes. As a result, we would have limited financial and operating flexibility in responding to changing economic and competitive conditions;

 ● limiting our ability to raise additional debt because it may be more difficult for us to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all; and

 ● placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.

​
In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks we now face could intensify.
​
We may need additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
​
We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, continue investing in our business, complete our 5G Network Deployment and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions (including significant investments in our Wireless business).  Weakness in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.  Adverse changes in the credit markets, including, but not limited to, rising interest rates, could increase our borrowing costs and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness.
​
In addition, economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to, among other things, generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, as well as to fund ongoing operations and service our debt. We may be unable to generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows from operating activities, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any refinancing or restructuring would sufficiently meet any debt or other obligations then due. Furthermore, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by their credit metrics.  A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.  A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.  As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.

​
The conditional conversion features of our Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.
​
In the event the conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes are triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the conversion rate, which could adversely affect our liquidity.
​
In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
​
The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes due 2026 may affect the value of the Convertible Notes due 2026 and our Class A common stock.
​
In connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes due 2026, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties (each an “option counterparty”). The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes due 2026, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our Class A common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless we elect to settle the warrants in cash. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes due 2026.
​
This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our Class A common stock or the Convertible Notes due 2026 at that time.  In addition, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2026 (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the Convertible Notes due 2026. In addition, if any such convertible note hedge and warrant transactions fail to become effective, each option counterparty may unwind its hedge position with respect to our Class A common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock and the value of the Convertible Notes due 2026.
​
We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.
​
Each option counterparty to the convertible note hedge transactions is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the convertible note hedge transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of an option counterparty will not be secured by any collateral.  Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its various affiliates. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.

​
From time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in securities that have limited liquidity and may not be immediately accessible to support our financing needs.
​
From time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in strategic investments, and as a result, a portion of our portfolio may have restricted liquidity. If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or there is a lack of liquidity in the marketplace, we may be required to record impairment charges. Moreover, the uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets can greatly affect the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, a portion of our investment portfolio may include strategic and financial investments in debt and equity securities of public companies that are highly speculative and experience volatility. Typically, these investments are concentrated in a small number of companies. The fair value of these investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. The concentration of these investments as a percentage of our overall investment portfolio fluctuates from time to time based on, among other things, the size of our investment portfolio and our ability to liquidate these investments. In addition, because our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of companies, we may experience a significant loss if any of these companies, among other things, defaults on its obligations, performs poorly, does not generate adequate cash flow to fund its operations, is unable to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or files for bankruptcy, or if the sectors in which these companies operate experience a market downturn. To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs.
​
We are controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chairman.
​
Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, beneficially owns approximately 52.1% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B common stock into Class A common stock) and controls approximately 90.5% of the total voting power. Through his voting power, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result, DISH Network is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Mr. Ergen is also the principal stockholder and Chairman of EchoStar.
​
It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our ownership structure.
​
Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:
​
 ● a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share, a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share;

​
 ● a provision that authorizes the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;

​
 ● a provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and

​
 ● a provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.

​

​

​
As discussed above, Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, controls approximately 90.5% of the total voting power of our company. Such control by Mr. Ergen may make it impractical for any third party to effect a change in control of our company. In addition, pursuant to our articles of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.
​
Legal and Regulatory Risks
​
Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.
​
We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services.  Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our business as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
​
Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. Moreover, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
​
In addition, we work with third parties such as vendors, contractors and suppliers for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products and services, and our products and services may contain technologies provided to us by these third parties or other third parties. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. Our vendors, contractors and suppliers may not be required to indemnify us if a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages.
​
Legal challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to use the products, services and technologies that we need in order to operate our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, content providers may be unwilling to provide access to their content. Changes in the copyright laws or how such laws may be interpreted could impact our ability to deliver content and provide certain features and functionality, particularly over the Internet.

​
We are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.
​
We are, and may become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, including among other things, intellectual property disputes. Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that may cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes on intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the intellectual property. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position. See “Item 1. Business – Patents and Other Intellectual Property” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our services or the products used in connection with our services may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first). Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which our services or the products used in connection with our services may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications. Further, it is sometimes not possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid.
​
Our services depend on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted.
​
If the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend, restrict, significantly condition, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to grant our applications for FCC licenses that we may file from time to time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As an example, a loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to us, potentially reducing the amount of DISH TV services available to our DISH TV subscribers. The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, Congress often considers and enacts legislation that affects us and FCC proceedings to implement the Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing. We cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.
​
Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, including, among other things, regulations governing the licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally 10-12 years that are subject to renewal or revocation.
​
There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with FCC build-out requirements in a given license area may result in acceleration of other build-out requirements or in the modification, cancellation, or non-renewal of licenses. See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

If our internal controls are not effective, our business, stock price and investor confidence in our financial results may be adversely affected.
​
We periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. We depend on our third-party vendors’ internal controls and rely on these controls when evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls. If in the future we are unable to report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree with our assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal control over financial reporting), investors, subscribers and business partners could lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.

We may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
​
You should read the following management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
​
Overview
​
We currently operate two primary business segments, Pay-TV and Wireless. Our Wireless business segment consists of two business units, Retail Wireless and 5G Network Deployment.
​
Our Pay-TV business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH® brand and the SLING® brand. We promote our Pay-TV services as providing our subscribers with a better “price-to-value” relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative.
​
Our Retail Wireless business unit offers prepaid and postpaid retail wireless services to subscribers under our Boost Mobile, Ting Mobile, Republic Wireless and Gen Mobile brands, as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. We offer customers value by providing choice and flexibility in our wireless services. We offer competitive consumer plans with no annual service contracts. Our retail wireless business strategy is to expand our current target segments and profitably grow our subscriber base by acquiring and retaining high quality subscribers while we complete our 5G Network Deployment. We intend to acquire high quality subscribers by providing competitive offers with innovative new value-added services that better meet those subscribers’ needs and budget. We intend on retaining those subscribers through those compelling new value-added services and outstanding customer service. As we work to integrate our retail wireless brands, one of our focuses is to ensure that our Pay-TV subscribers are aware of the increased value available to them through our retail wireless brands.
​
Our 5G Network Deployment business unit strategy is to commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines, including 20% of the U.S. population by June 2022 and 70% by June 2023.  We currently have over 50 markets under construction and completed a friendly user trial, drive testing and user equipment testing in Las Vegas during the fourth quarter of 2021. Our current construction is primarily focused on markets we intend to launch by June 2022 in conjunction with the 20% population coverage requirement.  However, we have also began construction of markets we intend to launch by June of 2023 that support the 70% population coverage requirement.

Recent Developments
 ​
COVID-19 Update
​
A novel strain of coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic.  COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in global travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also created unanticipated circumstances and uncertainty, disruption, and significant volatility in the economic environment generally, which have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our subscribers are impacted by recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities to, among other things, practice social distancing and to refrain from gathering in groups. While certain government regulations and/or mandates have eased, or are expected to ease in 2022 and COVID-19 vaccines have become broadly available, governmental authorities are continuing to monitor the situation and take various actions in an effort to slow or prevent an increase in the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 continues to impact our business during 2022, in particular in the following areas:
​
 ● In response to the pandemic and business disruption, first and foremost, we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees. We have implemented increased health and safety practices including, among other things, increased use of personal protective equipment for employees to protect them and our subscribers.

​
 ● Our DISH TV and Retail Wireless businesses have been and may be further impacted by: (i) government recommendations and/or mandates for commercial establishments to operate at reduced capacity; and (ii) reduced in person selling opportunities due to subscriber preferences and actions as well as government restrictions.

​
 ● Our supply chain has been impacted by COVID-19, and there have been and could be additional significant and unanticipated interruptions and/or delays in the supply of materials and/or equipment across our supply chain, due to, among other things, surges in COVID-19. Moreover, the recent surges in COVID-19 cases in areas outside the United States and the stringent lockdowns implemented in response to such surges are causing interruptions and/or delays that are adversely impacting, among other things, the software, hardware and testing related to our 5G Network Deployment. In addition, there have been worldwide interruptions and delays in the supply of electronic components including, but not limited to, semi-conductors, which have negatively impacted our ability to obtain set-top boxes, wireless devices and wireless network equipment. Furthermore, we may not be able to diversify sources of supply in a timely manner to mitigate these interruptions and/or delays or find new suppliers on reasonable terms or at all. These interruptions and/or delays in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our Pay-TV and Retail Wireless operations, our ability to meet our build-out requirement deadlines for our wireless spectrum licenses and our 5G Network Deployment generally.

​
We continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health agencies and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments beyond our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.

Acquisitions
​
Boost Mobile Acquisition
​
Asset Purchase Agreement. Effective on July 1, 2020, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the APA and in accordance with the Final Judgment, we completed the Boost Mobile Acquisition and DISH Network officially entered into the retail wireless market, serving more than 9 million subscribers under the Boost Mobile brand.
​
In connection with the Boost Mobile Acquisition and the consummation of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, we, T-Mobile, Sprint, DT and SoftBank came to an agreement with the DOJ on key terms and approval of the Transaction Agreements and our wireless service business and spectrum. On July 26, 2019, the Defendants entered into the Stipulation and Order with the DOJ binding the Defendants to the Proposed Final Judgment, which memorialized the agreement between the DOJ and the Defendants. The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment were filed in the District Court on July 26, 2019 and on April 1, 2020, the Final Judgment was entered with the District Court.
​
Ting Mobile Acquisition
​
On August 1, 2020, we completed the Ting Mobile Acquisition. In addition, we entered into a services agreement pursuant to which Tucows will act as a mobile virtual network enabler for certain of our retail Wireless subscribers.
​
Republic Wireless Acquisition
​
On May 1, 2021, we completed the Republic Wireless Acquisition. The consideration for the Republic Wireless Acquisition consisted of an upfront cash payment and an earn-out provision.
​
We accounted for the Boost Mobile Acquisition, the Ting Mobile Acquisition and the Republic Wireless Acquisition as business combinations. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and are consolidated into our financial statements. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS
​
Service revenue. “Service revenue” consists principally of Pay-TV and Wireless subscriber revenue. Certain of the amounts included in “Service revenue” are not recurring on a monthly basis.
​
Equipment sales and other revenue. “Equipment sales and other revenue” principally includes the sale of wireless devices and the non-subsidized sales of Pay-TV equipment.
​
Cost of services. “Cost of services” principally includes Pay-TV programming expenses and other operating costs related to our Pay-TV segment and costs of wireless services (including costs incurred under the MNSA and NSA).
​
Cost of sales - equipment and other. “Cost of sales – equipment and other” principally includes the cost of wireless devices and other related items as well as costs related to the non-subsidized sales of Pay-TV equipment. Costs are generally recognized as products are delivered to customers and the related revenue is recognized.
​

47

Table of Contents
​

​
Selling, general and administrative expenses. “Selling, general and administrative expenses” consists primarily of direct sales costs, advertising, third-party commissions related to the acquisition of subscribers, costs related to the installation of equipment for our new Pay-TV subscribers, the cost of subsidized sales of Pay-TV equipment for new subscribers and employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, and accounting and finance.
​
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” primarily includes interest expense associated with our long-term debt (net of capitalized interest), prepayment premiums, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, and interest expense associated with our finance lease obligations.
​
Other, net. The main components of “Other, net” are gains and losses realized on the sale and/or conversion of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and derivative instruments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of certain marketable investment securities and derivative instruments, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates.
​
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). EBITDA is defined as “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network” plus “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” and net of “Interest income,” “Income tax (provision) benefit, net” and “Depreciation and amortization.” This “non-GAAP measure” is reconciled to “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network” in our discussion of “Results of Operations” below.
​
Operating income before depreciation and amortization (“OIBDA”).  OIBDA is defined as “Operating income (loss)” plus “Depreciation and amortization.”  This “non-GAAP measure” is reconciled to “Operating income (loss)” in our discussion of “Results of Operations” below.
​
DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by $34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count.
​
SLING TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our SLING TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. SLING TV customers receiving service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our SLING TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple SLING TV packages, each customer is only counted as one SLING TV subscriber.
​
Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and SLING TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our SLING TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber.
​
Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (“Pay-TV ARPU”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Pay-TV segment “Service revenue,” excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period.
​
The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as SLING TV subscribers increase as a percentage of total Pay-TV subscribers, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.
​

​

​
DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate (“DISH TV churn rate”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two.
​
DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry.  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the “average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation,” or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  Our DISH TV SAC is calculated using all costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized equipment, advertising, installation, commissions and direct sales, etc.) which are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses,” plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs and the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers, divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.
​
Wireless subscribers. We include prepaid and postpaid customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our Wireless subscriber count.
​
Wireless average monthly revenue per subscriber (“Wireless ARPU”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per Wireless subscriber, or Wireless ARPU, by dividing average monthly Retail Wireless business unit “Service revenue” for the period by our average number of Wireless subscribers for the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two.
​
Wireless average monthly subscriber churn rate (“Wireless churn rate”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our “Wireless churn rate” for any period by dividing the number of Wireless subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of Wireless subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two.
​
Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

​
Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue totaled $17.881 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.388 billion or 15.4% compared to the same period in 2020. The increase primarily resulted from the completion of the Boost Mobile Acquisition on July 1, 2020.
​
Total operating income (loss). Our consolidated operating income totaled $3.203 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $620 million or 24.0% compared to the same period in 2020. The change primarily resulted from an increase in the operating income from our Pay-TV segment and the completion of the Boost Mobile Acquisition on July 1, 2020. The years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were negatively impacted by operating losses associated with our 5G Network Deployment business unit, including an “Impairment of long-lived assets” of $356 million in 2020. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​
Pay-TV Segment
​
We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH® brand and the SLING® brand. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10.707 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 8.221 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.486 million SLING TV subscribers.
​
We promote our Pay-TV services as providing our subscribers with better service, technology and value than those available from other subscription television service providers. We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription. Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national and regional cable networks. We also offer programming packages that include local broadcast networks, specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming. We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. Our SLING TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including, among others, streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones. We offer SLING domestic, SLING International, and SLING Latino video programming services.
​
Trends in our Pay-TV Segment
​
Competition
​
Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers. In recent years, industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings. These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue.
​
We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper® receivers, and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services.
​
Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies that are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. We also face competition from providers of video content, many of which are providers of our programming content, that distribute content over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These product offerings include, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Prime Video, YouTube TV, Disney+, ESPN+, ViacomCBS, HBO Max, STARZ, Peacock, Fubo and Philo.
​
Significant changes in consumer behavior regarding the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.

​

​
In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband or internet-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services (“cord cutting”), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (“cord shaving”) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies.
​
Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our public filings. These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all.
​
Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
​
Programming
​
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our “Cost of services” and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers.
​
Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay-per-view movies.
​
Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts before they expire. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. On October 6, 2021, Tegna Inc. (“Tegna”) removed its channels from our DISH TV programming lineup in 53 markets. On February 4, 2022, we and Tegna signed a new programming carriage contract which restored these channels to our DISH TV programming lineup. Although subscriber demand for local network stations has decreased in recent years as a result of, among other things, programming being available to subscribers through alternative methods, including over the air antennas, there can be no assurance that the removal of these or other channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In addition, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from additional programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses.

**During the first quarter of 2020, we removed approximately 250,000 subscribers representing commercial accounts impacted by COVID-19 from our ending DISH TV subscriber count.  During the year ended December, 31, 2020, 80,000 of these subscribers came off pause or had temporary rate relief end and were added to our DISH TV subscriber count during the periods they returned in 2020, and 69,000 of these subscribers disconnected. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the remaining commercial accounts representing 101,000 subscribers disconnected. The effect of the removal of the 250,000 subscribers, the addition of these 80,000 subscribers and disconnect of 170,000 subscribers was excluded from the calculation of our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, net DISH TV subscriber additions/losses and DISH TV churn rate.  See “Results of Operations – Pay-TV subscribers” for further information.

​

Pay-TV Subscribers
​
DISH TV subscribers. We lost approximately 595,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the loss of approximately 408,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2020. This increase in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a slightly higher DISH TV churn rate.
​
SLING TV subscribers. We added approximately 12,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the loss of approximately 118,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2020. The increase in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to higher SLING TV subscriber activations. We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers. The year ended December 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by delays and cancellations of sporting events as a result of COVID-19.
​
DISH TV subscribers, gross. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we activated approximately 835,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 1.094 million gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2020, a decrease of 23.7%. This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand and channel removals, including Tegna, as well as increased competitive pressures, including aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, live-linear OTT service providers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. Furthermore, we continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and cannot predict with certainty the impact to our gross new DISH TV subscribers as a result of, among other things, lower discretionary spending and reduced ability to perform our in-home service operations due to the impact of social distancing.
​
DISH TV churn rate. Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.40% compared to 1.38% for the same period in 2020. Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was negatively impacted by programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, including Tegna. In addition, our DISH TV churn rate was positively impacted by COVID-19 beginning in the second quarter of 2020, including, among other things, the recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities that customers refrain from non-essential movements outside of their homes and the resulting increased consumption of our Pay-TV services. Furthermore, COVID-19 had an impact on competitive pressures due to, among other things, a reduction in customers’ willingness to allow competitors’ technicians into their homes. We continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and while certain government regulations and/or mandates have eased, or are expected to ease in 2022, we cannot predict with certainty the impact to our DISH TV churn rate as a result of, among other things, lower discretionary spending and reduced ability to perform our in-home service operations due to the impact of social distancing. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud, and the level of our retention efforts.
​
Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. On October 6, 2021, Tegna removed its channels from our DISH TV programming lineup in 53 markets. On February 4, 2022, we and Tegna signed a new programming carriage contract which restored these channels to our DISH TV programming lineup. Although subscriber demand for local network stations has decreased in recent years as a result of, among other things, programming being available to subscribers through alternative methods, including over the air antennas, there can be no assurance that the removal of these or other channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.

​
Beginning in March 2020, several federal, state, and local government agencies implemented recommendations, guidelines, and orders regarding “social distancing” in an attempt to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19. As a result of these actions, many bars, restaurants, and other commercial establishments were ordered to and in certain cases continue to be recommended and/or ordered to suspend all non-essential “in-person” business operations and/or operate at reduced capacity. In addition, airlines and hotels significantly reduced operations as a result of government actions and/or related lower consumer demand. In an effort to avoid charging commercial customers for services in their establishments which were no longer open to the public, we paused service or provided temporary rate relief for certain of those commercial accounts. For certain commercial accounts, each subscription is counted as one DISH TV subscriber. For other commercial accounts, as discussed above, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by $34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count. During the first quarter of 2020, we removed 250,000 subscribers from our ending DISH TV subscriber count for commercial accounts we placed on pause, or received reduced revenue, or for which we anticipate the account to disconnect due to COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 80,000 of these subscribers came off pause or had temporary rate relief end and 69,000 of these subscribers disconnected. We did not incur any significant expenses in connection with the return of the 80,000 commercial accounts and accordingly, those commercial accounts were added to our ending subscriber count during the periods they returned in 2020 and were not recorded as gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. During the first quarter of 2021, the remaining commercial accounts representing 101,000 subscribers disconnected.
​
We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue.
​
Service revenue. “Service revenue” totaled $12.748 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $46 million or 0.4% compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in “Service revenue” compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily related to an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base.
​
Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $95.94 during the year ended December 31, 2021 versus $91.77 during the same period in 2020. The $4.17 or 4.5% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV programming package price increases effective in the first and fourth quarters of 2021 and first quarter of 2020, the SLING TV programming package price increases effective in the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020 and higher ad sales revenue, partially offset by an increase in SLING TV subscribers as a percentage of our total Pay-TV subscriber base. SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, the increase in SLING TV subscribers as a percentage of our total Pay-TV subscriber base had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.
​
Cost of services. “Cost of services” totaled $7.735 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $77 million or 1.0% compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in “Cost of services” was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and a decrease in variable and retention costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Variable and retention costs per subscriber decreased due to, among other things, increased operational efficiencies, including a focused set of staffing reductions in 2020. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. “Cost of services” represented 60.7% and 61.5% of “Service revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
​
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our “Cost of services” have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base.
​

​

Selling, general and administrative expenses. “Selling, general and administrative expenses” totaled $1.474 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021, a $20 million or 1.4% increase compared to the same period in 2020. This change was primarily driven by a $70 million reduction to litigation expense as a result of the Telemarketing Litigation settlement during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, reduced marketing expenditures and by cost cutting initiatives in the Pay-TV segment, including a focused set of staffing reductions in 2020.
​
Depreciation and amortization. “Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $539 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, a $75 million or 12.2% decrease compared to the same period in 2020. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers.
​
DISH TV SAC.  DISH TV SAC was $823 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $851 during the same period in 2020, a decrease of $28 or 3.3%.  This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in hardware costs per activation and higher commercial additions compared to the same period in 2020, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs per subscriber.  The decrease in hardware costs per activation primarily resulted from lower average costs per receiver due to receiver mix and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. Commercial activations historically have lower DISH TV SAC than residential activations, and therefore the increase in commercial activations have a positive impact on DISH TV SAC.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled $72 million and $151 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts.
​
To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.
​
Our “DISH TV SAC” may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies. See further information under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs.”

Wireless Segment
​
Our Wireless business segment operates in two business units, Retail Wireless and 5G Network Deployment. Revenue and operating income (loss) by business unit are shown in the table below:
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
------------------------------------ - -------------- --------------- - - --------------------- - - ------------ - - -------------- -

Operating income (loss) ​ $ 162,743 ​ $ (483,311) ​ $ — ​ $ (320,568) ​

​
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total purchases of property and equipment for our wireless segment were $1.012 billion and $96 million, respectively. This increase primarily resulted from capital expenditures related to our 5G Network Deployment. We anticipate expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to increase substantially in 2022.
​
Wireless – Retail Wireless
​
We entered the retail wireless business in 2020 as a result of the Boost Mobile Acquisition and the Ting Mobile Acquisition and we expanded the business in 2021 through the Republic Wireless Acquisition. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We offer nationwide prepaid and postpaid retail wireless services to subscribers under our Boost Mobile, Ting Mobile, Republic Wireless and Gen Mobile brands, as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. In 2021, LG Electronics Inc., a large provider of wireless devices, announced they were closing their mobile business unit. We continue to work to procure wireless devices from alternative suppliers, however, there can be no assurances we will be able to procure the supply needed to meet subscriber demand and any inability to do so could negatively impact our Wireless subscriber activations, retail wireless base and our results of operations. Prepaid wireless subscribers generally pay in advance for monthly access to wireless talk, text, and data services.  Postpaid wireless subscribers are qualified to pay after receiving wireless talk, text, and data services.  We are currently operating our Retail Wireless business unit as an MVNO while we complete our 5G Network Deployment. On July 14, 2021, we entered into a ten-year NSA with AT&T to provide us with network services. Under the NSA, we expect AT&T will become our primary network services provider.  As an MVNO, today we primarily depend on T-Mobile as well as AT&T to provide us with network services under the MNSA and NSA, respectively. A substantial portion of our retail Wireless subscribers currently receive services through T-Mobile’s CDMA Network. However, T-Mobile provided notice that it intends to shutdown the CDMA Network on March 31, 2022. A forced migration of this scale on this time frame will potentially leave approximately a million low-income Boost subscribers without service.  Our Retail Wireless operations have been and continue to be disrupted by, among other things, having our subscribers potentially lose service and/or face increased costs, which could result in a significant increase in our Wireless churn rate.  While we are working to mitigate the harms of this shutdown, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to upgrade subscriber wireless devices on this accelerated timeline. We have implemented targeted efforts and promotions directed at impacted customers; however, there can be no assurance these attempts will be successful.  Wireless device shortages, among other things, have limited our ability to mitigate the effects of the CDMA shutdown and negatively impact our Wireless churn rate, Wireless subscriber activations, retail Wireless base and our results of operations.

​
In November 2020, DISH Network sought intervention from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (“Division”) under the Final Judgment (“FJ”) entered by Judge Kelly of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  On July 9, 2021, the Division issued a letter to DISH Network and T-Mobile in response to DISH Network’s request, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
​
We acquired over 9 million subscribers as a result of the Boost Mobile Acquisition, acquired over 200,000 subscribers as a result of the Ting Mobile Acquisition and acquired over 200,000 subscribers as a result of the Republic Wireless Acquisition. Our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the results of the Boost Mobile Acquisition from July 1, 2020, the Ting Mobile Acquisition from August 1, 2020 and the Republic Wireless Acquisition from May 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had 8.546 million retail Wireless subscribers.
​
Currently, we offer Wireless subscribers competitive consumer plans with no annual service contracts and monthly service plans including high-speed data and unlimited talk and text.
​
Competition
​
Retail Wireless is a mature market with moderate year-over-year organic growth. Competitors include providers who offer similar communication services, such as talk, text and data. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include, but are not limited to, pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience and service quality. We compete with a number of national wireless carriers, including Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, all of which are significantly larger than us, serve a significant percentage of all wireless subscribers and enjoy scale advantages compared to us. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are currently the only nationwide MNOs in the United States.
​
Primary competitors to our Retail Wireless business unit include, but are not limited to, Metro PCS (owned by T-Mobile), Cricket Wireless (owned by AT&T), Visible (owned by Verizon), Tracfone Wireless (owned by Verizon), and other MVNOs such as Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile.
​
Wireless – 5G Network Deployment
​
We have directly invested approximately $20 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses (including the 3.45-3.55 GHz band licenses purchased in the first quarter of 2022) and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of approximately $30 billion. The $30 billion of investments related to wireless spectrum licenses does not include $6 billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses.  See Note 2 and Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
DISH Network Spectrum
​
We have directly invested approximately $20 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses (including the 3.45-3.55 GHz band licenses purchased in the first quarter of 2022). These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. We plan to commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines, including 20% of the U.S. population by June 2022 and 70% by June 2023.  We currently have over 50 markets under construction and completed a friendly user trial, drive testing and user equipment testing in Las Vegas during the fourth quarter of 2021. Our current construction is primarily focused on markets we intend to launch by June 2022 in conjunction with the 20% population coverage requirement.  However, we have also began construction of markets we intend to launch by June of 2023 that support the 70% population coverage requirement.

​
We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, complete our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we complete our 5G Network Deployment we will incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to complete our 5G Network Deployment and to compete with other wireless service providers. See Note 2 and Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses
​
During 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. (“American II”) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. (“American III”), we initially made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, LLC (“Northstar Spectrum”), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, L.L.C. (“Northstar Wireless,” and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the “Northstar Entities”), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC (“SNR HoldCo”), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC (“SNR Wireless,” and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the “SNR Entities”), respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the “AWS-3 Licenses”) to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in “FCC authorizations” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. The Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may be obtained from third party sources or from us, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out and integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any loans, equity contributions or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​
The results of the Boost Mobile Acquisition from July 1, 2020, the Ting Mobile Acquisition from August 1, 2020 and the Republic Wireless Acquisition from May 1, 2021 are included in our Retail Wireless business unit. During the third quarter of 2020, we added over 9 million Wireless subscribers as a result of the Boost Mobile Acquisition and the Ting Mobile Acquisition. During the second quarter of 2021, we acquired over 200,000 subscribers as a result of the Republic Wireless Acquisition. We are currently in the process of integrating our Retail Wireless operations and have made and continue to make targeted changes to our marketing, sales, and operations to further enhance our profitability. We lost 728,000 net Wireless subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of these operational changes, competitive pressures, ongoing optimizations to the existing business, wireless device shortages and the impact of the shutdown of the CDMA Network. While we took aggressive efforts to mitigate the impact of shutdown of the CDMA Network on our Retail Wireless operations, wireless devices shortages impaired our ability to both upgrade subscriber wireless devices and also activate gross new Wireless subscribers. As of December 31, 2021, we have incurred approximately $250 million in wireless device upgrade expense primarily as a result of the CDMA shutdown. During the first six months of 2022, we expect to continue to incur substantial costs as a result of the CDMA shutdown, including without limitation, elevated Wireless churn. Consequently, the circumstances surrounding T-Mobile’s shutdown of its CDMA Network and our efforts in responding to such shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Our current results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results, in part based on the ongoing integration and operational changes we are currently implementing. Furthermore, we have and continue to face increased competitive pressures, including aggressive competitor marketing, service promotions and deeper wireless device subsidies. We expect wireless devices shortages to continue in 2022, which could have a negative impact on our gross new Wireless subscriber activations.

​
Equipment sales and other revenue. “Equipment sales and other revenue” totaled $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $62 million compared to the same period in 2020. This increase primarily resulted from leasing a portion of our 600 MHz spectrum licenses to T-Mobile, which began on September 11, 2020. The spectrum lease with T-Mobile had an original annual value of $56 million during its 42 month term, however we expect this amount to decrease as we exercise our right to terminate individual licenses prior to the end of their term. The specific termination rights vary by license and we exercised our ability to terminate certain licenses in the first quarter of 2021 in accordance with our buildout schedule.
​
Cost of sales – equipment and other. “Cost of sales – equipment and other” totaled $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $81 million compared to the same period in 2020. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in lease expense on communication towers and costs related to our 5G Network Deployment.
​
Selling, general and administrative expenses “Selling, general and administrative expenses” totaled $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $50 million increase compared to the same period in 2020. This change was primarily driven by an increase in costs to support our 5G Network Deployment.
​
Impairment of long-lived assets. “Impairment of long-lived assets” of $356 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from impairments of the T1 satellite and D1 satellites, as well as certain wireless equipment and operating lease assets related to our narrowband IoT deployment which we no longer intend to complete. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​
Interest income. “Interest income” totaled $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $11 million or 50.1% compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease primarily resulted from lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities, partially offset by higher average cash and marketable investment securities balances during the year ended December 31, 2021.
​
Other, net. “Other, net” income totaled $21 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $41 million compared to the same period in 2020. This change primarily resulted from a favorable determination pursuant to the arbitration procedures under our APA with T-Mobile with respect to the disputed net working capital items, resulting in a gain of $39 million in 2021 and a $9 million decrease in the unrealized loss recognized in 2021 compared to 2020 in the fair value of our option to purchase certain of T-Mobile’s 800 MHz spectrum licenses under the Spectrum Purchase Agreement. See Note 7 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was $763 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $65 million compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in the provision was primarily related to an increase in “Income (loss) before income taxes,” partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher due to non-recurring state tax rate changes applied to our deferred taxes as a result of the Boost Mobile Acquisition, partially offset by a benefit recognized for the carryback of net operating losses under the CARES Act.

Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Reconciliation
​
It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.
​
Consolidated EBITDA
​
Consolidated EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it is a helpful measure for those evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Segment OIBDA
​
Segment OIBDA, which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance.  We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability of our business units on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions for those business units, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment OIBDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to business unit operating income (loss).  See Note 17 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

The changes in OIBDA during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses, including the negative impact of “Impairment of long-lived assets” of $356 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
​
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
​
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities
​
We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Note 7 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $5.404 billion compared to $3.733 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.671 billion. This increase in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities primarily resulted from cash generated from operating activities of $4.031 billion, $1.490 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 1/8% Senior Notes due 2029 and a $337 million deposit refund from our participation in Auction 107. These increases were partially offset by the repurchases and redemption of our 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2021 with an aggregate principal balance of $2.0 billion and capital expenditures of $1.964 billion (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations).

​

​
Restricted Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Investment Securities
​
As of December 31, 2021, our restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $5.335 billion compared to $108 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.227 billion. This increase in restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities primarily resulted from $2.737 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and $2.488 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, which include restrictions which may vary in nature depending on the ultimate use of proceeds.
​
Debt Issuances and Maturity
​
On July 1, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7 3/8% Senior Notes due July 1, 2028. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 7 3/8% and is payable semi-annually in cash, in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year.
​
On December 21, 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 0% Convertible Notes due December 15, 2025.
​
On May 24, 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/8% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 5 1/8% and is payable semi-annually in cash, in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
 ​
On November 26, 2021, we issued $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due December 1, 2026. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 5 1/4% and is payable semi-annually in cash, in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2022.
​
On November 26, 2021, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due December 1, 2028. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 5 3/4% and is payable semi-annually in cash, in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2022.
​
Our 5 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.1 billion were redeemed on May 1, 2020.
​
Our 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2021 with an aggregate principal balance of $2.0 billion were repurchased or redeemed as of June 1, 2021.
​
Our 5 7/8% Senior Notes due 2022 with an aggregate principal balance of $2.0 billion mature on July 15, 2022. We expect to fund this obligation from cash and marketable investment securities balances at that time.  But, depending on market conditions, we may refinance this obligation in whole or in part.
​
Cash Flow
​
The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base, expand our infrastructure, make strategic investments, such as significant investments in our Wireless business, including our 5G Network Deployment, and repay debt obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported “Net cash flows from operating activities” of $4.031 billion and $3.312 billion, respectively.
​
Net cash flows from operating activities from 2020 to 2021 increased $719 million, primarily attributable to increases in cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including taxes. In 2020, changes in operating assets and liabilities were negatively impacted by the $210 million litigation settlement payment related to the Telemarketing Litigation. These increases were partially offset by an $78 million decrease in income adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for “Impairment of long-lived assets,” “Depreciation and amortization” expense, “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments and derivatives,” “Non-cash, stock-based compensation” expense, and “Deferred tax expense (benefit).”

​

Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, acquisitions, strategic investments, including purchases and settlements of derivative financial instruments, and purchases of wireless spectrum licenses, capital expenditures and capitalized interest. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported outflows from “Net cash flows from investing activities” of $4.410 billion and $3.862 billion, respectively.
​
The year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to $2.618 billion in net purchases of marketable investment securities and capital expenditures of $1.964 billion (including capitalized interest primarily related to FCC authorizations), partially offset by a $337 million deposit refund from our participation in Auction 107.
​
The year ended December 31, 2020 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to the closing of the Boost Mobile Acquisition for a net aggregate purchase price of $1.313 billion, capital expenditures of $1.193 billion (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations), a $1.388 billion payment to the FCC for the 3550-3650 MHz Licenses, the 37 GHz, 39 GHZ and 47 GHz Licenses, and the 3.7-3.98 GHz Licenses.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, capital expenditures for wireless equipment totaled $1.012 billion and $96 million, respectively. The increase in 2021 for wireless equipment primarily resulted from the build-out of our 5G Network Deployment. In addition, capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment totaled $104 million and $211 million, respectively. The decrease in 2021 for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment primarily resulted from lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts.
​
Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of equity and long-term and convertible debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, and repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported “Net cash flows from financing activities” inflows of $4.659 billion and $1.499 billion, respectively.
​
The net cash inflows in 2021 primarily related to $2.737 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 1/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, $2.488 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, $1.490 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 5 1/8% Senior Notes due 2029, partially offset by the repurchases and redemption of our 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2021 with an aggregate principal balance of $2.0 billion.

The net cash inflows in 2020 primarily related to $1.986 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 0% Convertible Notes due 2025 and $998 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our 7 3/8% Senior Notes due 2028, partially offset by the redemption of our 5 1/8% Senior Notes due 2020 with an aggregate principal balance of $1.1 billion, a $312 million payment for the Northstar Purchase Agreement and repayment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $101 million.
​
Free Cash Flow
​
We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment,” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments (including strategic wireless investments), fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating income,” “Net income,” “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure “Net cash flows from operating activities.”
​
Free cash flow can be significantly impacted from period to period by changes in “Net income (loss)” adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges, operating assets and liabilities, “Purchases of property and equipment,” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations.” These items are shown in the “Net cash flows from operating activities” and “Net cash flows from investing activities” sections on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management’s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts.

​

In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber additions (losses), service revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition and retention costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs for DISH TV subscribers, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, expenditures related to our 5G Network Deployment and other factors.

Operational Liquidity
​
We make general investments in property such as satellites, wireless devices, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our Pay-TV segment and Retail Wireless business unit.  We are also making significant additional investments and will need to continue making these investments and/or partner with others to, among other things, complete our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out, and integrate our wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. Moreover, since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers.  While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary.  Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment.  Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurances that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment.
​
There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time.  The first factor is our churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers.  To the extent we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced.  The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our service margins.  To the extent our “Cost of services” grow faster than our “Service revenue,” the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced.  Our Pay-TV service margins have been reduced by, among other things, a shift to lower priced Pay-TV programming packages and higher programming costs.  Our Retail Wireless service margins are impacted by our MNSA agreement with T-Mobile and our NSA agreement with AT&T and the speed with which we are able to convert retail Wireless subscribers onto our 5G Network once operational.  The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers.  The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers.  Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period.  Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we complete our 5G Network Deployment, incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities.  We anticipate expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to increase substantially during 2022 and in future periods. As a result, our current cash flow is not necessarily indicative of our future cash flows. In addition, declines in our Pay-TV and retail Wireless subscriber base and any decrease in subscriber related-margins negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurances that our subscriber declines will not continue.

​
Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs
​
We incur significant upfront costs to acquire Pay-TV and retail Wireless subscribers, including advertising, independent third-party retailer incentives, payments made to third-parties, equipment and wireless device subsidies, installation services, and/or new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. With respect to our DISH TV services, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments to receive service for a minimum term. We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV services over longer periods of time. Subscriber acquisition costs for SLING TV subscribers are significantly lower than those for DISH TV subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper® receivers, and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods to existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Retention costs for retail Wireless subscribers are primarily related to promotional pricing on upgraded wireless devices for qualified existing subscribers. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
Seasonality
​
Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV industry. In addition, the first and fourth quarters generally produce a lower DISH TV churn rate than the second and third quarters. However, in recent years, as the pay-TV industry has matured, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. As a result, historical trends in seasonality described above may not be indicative of future trends.
​
Our net SLING TV subscriber additions are impacted by, among other things, certain major sporting events and other major television events. The first and third quarters generally produce higher gross new retail Wireless subscriber activations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the historical trends discussed above, for net DISH TV subscriber additions, net SLING TV subscriber additions and gross new retail Wireless subscriber activations, may not be indicative of future trends.
​
Satellites
​
Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, competitive conditions may require that we expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity.
​
Stock Repurchases
​
Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock. On November 1, 2021, our Board of Directors extended this authorization such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion under this program. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no repurchases of our Class A common stock.

​
Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt
​
We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. In particular, the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by DISH DBS Corporation (“DISH DBS”) contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on DISH DBS’ capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS’ capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. In addition, the Convertible Notes provide that, if a “fundamental change” (as defined in the related indenture) occurs, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we and DISH DBS were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt.
​
Other
​
We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.
​
Obligations and Future Capital Requirements
​
Contractual Obligations
​
See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Future Capital Requirements
​
We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures, other investments, and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. We will need to make significant additional investments to, among other things, complete our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate our wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital, capital expenditure and other investment needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we deploy our 5G network, the purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses and the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs.
​
Certain of our capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be driven by the rate at which we deploy our 5G network as well as costs associated with subscriber premises equipment. These expenditures are necessary for the deployment of our 5G network as well as to operate and maintain our DISH TV services. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. In addition, the Northstar and SNR Operative Agreements, as amended, provide for, among other things, the SNR Put Right and the Northstar Put Right for a purchase price that equals the equity contribution to Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo, respectively, plus a fixed annual rate of return. During the fourth quarter of 2021 the SNR Put Right was exercised. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate value of Northstar Manager’s ownership interest in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Management’s ownership interest in SNR HoldCo was $395 million, recorded as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

​

We expect to incur significant capital expenditures in 2022 related to our 5G Network Deployment, including capital expenditures associated with our 5G Network Deployment, and the potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses. The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. These factors, including a reduction in our available future cash flows, could require that we raise additional capital in the future.
​
Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position.

Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity
​
The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Critical Accounting Estimates
​
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
​
Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant.
​
Wireless Spectrum Licenses. During 2021, we acquired the 3550-3650 MHz (CBRS) and 3.7-3.98 GHz wireless licenses, together (the “C-Band Licenses”). During 2020, we acquired the 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz wireless licenses and during 2019, we acquired the 24 GHz and 28 GHz wireless licenses, together (the “High-Band Licenses”). In 2021, we combined our 600 MHz, 700 MHz, AWS-4, H Block, High-Band Licenses, C-Band Licenses and the Northstar Licenses and SNR Licenses into a single unit of accounting. In 2020 and 2019, we combined our 600 MHz, 700 MHz, AWS-4, H Block, and the Northstar Licenses and SNR Licenses into a single unit of accounting, excluding the High-Band Licenses. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, management performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceed the carrying amount. In our assessment, we considered several factors, including, among other things, the projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, and market transactions for wireless spectrum licenses including auction results. In assessing these factors, we considered both macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions. In contemplating all factors in their totality, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeds their carrying amount.

​

During 2020, our 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz wireless spectrum licenses were assessed as a single unit of accounting. These licenses were purchased during 2020 through our participation in Auction 103. For 2020, management’s assessment of the fair value of these licenses was determined based on the auction results.
​
During 2019, our 24 GHz and 28 GHz wireless spectrum licenses were assessed as a single unit of accounting. These licenses were purchased during the fourth quarter 2019 through our participation in Auction 101 and Auction 102. For 2019, management’s assessment of the fair value of these licenses was determined based on the auction results.
​
During 2021, 2020, and 2019, our multichannel video distribution and data service (“MVDDS”) wireless spectrum licenses were assessed as a single unit of accounting.  For 2021, 2020 and 2019, management assessed these licenses qualitatively. Our qualitative assessment focused on recent auction results and historical market activity. We concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeded their carrying amount.
​
Changes in circumstances or market conditions could result in a write-down of any of the above wireless spectrum licenses in the future.
​
Income Taxes
​
Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either “Income tax (provision) benefit, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Stockholders’ equity (deficit)” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations.
​
Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position. Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our “Income tax provision (benefit), net,” which could be material to our consolidated results of operations.
​
Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
​
Contingent Liabilities
​
A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to “Selling, general and administrative expenses” or “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

​
Business Combinations
​
When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The accounting standard for business combinations requires identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at acquisition date fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and the discount rate utilized.

We do not have any material backlog of our products.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet.
