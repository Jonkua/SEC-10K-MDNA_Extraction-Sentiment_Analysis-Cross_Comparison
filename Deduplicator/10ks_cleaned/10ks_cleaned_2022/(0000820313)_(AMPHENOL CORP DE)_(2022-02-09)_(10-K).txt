Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
​
Our Strategy
​
The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:
​
 ● Pursue broad market diversification - The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”.

​
 ● Develop high-technology performance-enhancing solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships with customers across its diverse end markets. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect, antenna and sensor products, and have been developed across the Company’s markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as antennas and sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.

​
 ● Expand global presence - The Company is continually expanding its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships. As the Company’s global customers have grown their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers. The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities, including new product development. The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities around the world.

​
 ● Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and performance and comprehensive customer service

 are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own. This mindset was particularly important in 2021, as inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges accelerated.

​
 ● Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s position with customers across our diverse end markets, our leading technologies and our access to low-cost manufacturing around the world. In 2021, the Company invested approximately $1.5 billion (net of the proceeds received from the divestiture of MTS Systems Corporation’s (“MTS”) Test & Simulation business in December 2021) to fund seven acquisitions, including the acquisitions of MTS’s Sensors business in April 2021 and Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) in December 2021. In 2020, the Company invested approximately $50 million to fund two acquisitions. Our acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 have strengthened our customer base and product offerings in many of our end markets.

​
 ● Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure. Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs. In addition, Amphenol’s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with their peers throughout the Company to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals. As the Company has grown, we have preserved this unique culture of entrepreneurship by ensuring that our executive organization can effectively drive the performance of and collaboration among our global general managers. The alignment of the Company’s businesses into three newly formed Divisions, which will represent the newly formed reportable segments effective January 1, 2022, is another step in enhancing the scalability of the Company’s entrepreneurial organization.

​
Customers and Geographies
​
The Company manufactures and sells a broad portfolio of products on a global basis to customers in a wide variety of industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us with the opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important asset of the Company.
​
A trend among customers has been to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment. As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with customers to develop new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products. In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and performance and lower product lead-time and cost. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s sales, refer to the subsection titled “Risks related to our end markets” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in approximately 40 countries around the world. Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and operational agility, as well as a deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to particular geographies. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were generally able to support our customers even if pandemic-related restrictions were adopted in any given country. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
​
The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to ensure proximity and reliable service to customers, while also lowering production and logistics costs. The Company’s strategy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and attempting to maximize operating profitability as well as the return on capital investments. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis. To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established certain facilities near these major customers. The Company seeks to position its manufacturing and assembly facilities in order to serve local markets while coordinating, as appropriate, product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s foreign operations, refer to the subsection titled “Risks related to our global operations” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.
​
Research and Development
​
The Company’s product development strategy is to rely on product design teams at each of our operating units around the world working collaboratively with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs. The Company generally focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. At the end of 2021, our research, development, and engineering efforts, which relate to the creation of new and improved products and processes, were supported by approximately 3,500 of our employees and were performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and product technologies.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We own a significant portfolio of patents that principally relate to mechanical, electrical, optical and electronic features of connector, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.
​
We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
​
From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes with third parties regarding the Company’s or such third party’s intellectual property assets, particularly patents. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents, or by a third party’s successful enforcement of its patents against us or any of our products. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, refer to the risk factor titled “We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.

Raw Materials
​
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials. The Company also purchases a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of its products. Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components or, if one source is used, the Company generally attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements. From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company. While the Company does not currently anticipate any significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, beginning in 2021 and into 2022, there have been supply chain and logistical challenges that have impacted the global economy, including our Company, and have caused supply constraints and commodity price increases on certain raw materials and components used by the Company in production, as well as lower availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. Consequently, the Company may experience supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components in the future, which could be further exacerbated by increased commodity prices and additional inflation. For a discussion of certain risks related to the availability of and dependence on raw materials and components, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers are experiencing difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. Information regarding our obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
Competition
​
The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Primary competitors include Aptiv, Belden, Carlisle, Commscope, Eaton, Foxconn, Hirose, HUBER+SUHNER, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity, Yazaki and 3M, among others. In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products. For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.
​
Backlog and Seasonality
​
The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $3.809 billion compared with backlog of approximately $2.380 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Company’s backlog was related to the significant sales increase, the addition of seven acquired companies, as well as the impact of certain customers placing longer lead-time orders due to the wide array of supply chain constraints occurring in many industries in 2021. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s business, such as sales to the communications-related markets (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand. Generally, the Company does not experience significant seasonality in its business, although historically, the strongest quarters have typically been the last two quarters of our fiscal year.
​
Sustainability
​
At Amphenol, we believe that making sustainable business choices, building strong relationships with our stakeholders and engaging in good corporate governance create long-term value for our Company. Whether through minimizing our and our partners’ environmental footprint, following humane labor practices, supporting the development and diversity of our global team, ensuring the strength and integrity of our supply chain or giving back to our communities, we have always believed that it is not just good stewardship, but good business to focus on the long-term sustainability of Amphenol. Throughout Amphenol, we have a shared commitment to create life-changing innovations and products which enable technologies that improve the lives of people around the world, all while

Our 2021 Sustainability Report is expected to be released during the second quarter of 2022.
​
Human Capital Management and Our Culture
​
The Company’s success is closely tied to the capability, adaptability and accountability of our diverse, global organization. One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization. We believe this structure, with approximately 130 general managers running unique, independent businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our general managers has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.
​
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 90,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 10,000 are located in the United States. Approximately 10% of Amphenol’s U.S. workforce is represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective bargaining. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees.
​
Governance and Culture – Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture and ESG initiatives. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees. At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, multiple times a year, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, compensation and culture. We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Amphenol is committed to workplace diversity and fostering a culture of equity, inclusion and belonging across our organization. Our business spans the globe and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of our geographic footprint. At Amphenol, we promote and maintain a culture of respect and appreciation of differences in our employees. The Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community. A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders. Our core management team is comprised of these general managers, as well as their controllers and our executive team. Women represented 28% of this core management team at the end of 2021. Of our total employees worldwide, approximately half are women.
​
Health, Safety and Well-being – We believe that the protection of our employees is a moral obligation. In addition, the safety and well-being of our employees is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team and are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees throughout the world, including, in particular, those employees who work in our factories. These actions have included adopting mask requirements, creating social distancing in our factories, upgrading air handling systems to install anti-viral filtration systems, as well as encouraging, enabling and, in certain geographies, requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. During more significant localized outbreaks of COVID-19, we have also enabled and encouraged certain employees to work from home, when possible and appropriate, and have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees optimally manage their work and personal responsibilities.
​
Compensation and Benefits – The Company is focused on providing our employees around the world equitable and competitive compensation and benefits. In the U.S., in addition to competitive compensation, the Company maintains

12

Table of Contents

various employee benefits such as health and related insurance, retirement savings programs and health savings and flexible spending accounts. Outside the U.S., we maintain compensation and other benefits competitive with local market conditions.
​
Community and Social Impact – Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work. Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services to immobile individuals. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our local teams have worked to support their communities through the purchase and donation of supplies and equipment, as well as financial support of local health care institutions.
​
Cybersecurity
​
In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Company has a comprehensive and evolving cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. We regularly perform risk assessments and penetration tests relating to cybersecurity and technology risks. We also conduct regular workforce training to instruct employees how to better identify cybersecurity concerns and to avoid actions that might inadvertently allow outsiders to access our systems. We install and regularly update our next-generation end point protection software on our company-managed systems and workstations in an effort to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems. The Company’s annual internal audits also include procedures performed on our control environment including our information security systems. Our Board of Directors maintains oversight responsibility relating to our information security and cybersecurity program, with assistance from the Audit Committee of the Board. At least annually, our senior leadership team (including the leaders of our Information Technology and Internal Audit teams) provides an overview of our information security and cybersecurity program to the full Board. In addition, the Company maintains standard cybersecurity insurance. During the last three years, we have not experienced a material security breach and, as a result, we have not incurred any material expenses from such a breach. Furthermore, during such time, we have not been penalized or paid any amount under any information security breach settlement.
​
Environmental Matters
​
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States, and changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.
​
The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. During 2021, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 71% of the Company’s net sales, with China constituting approximately 28% of the Company’s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company’s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States.
​
In recent years, the U.S. government has enacted new laws and taken actions that directly affect our business in China. For example, during the last few years, the U.S. Department of Commerce has added a number of Chinese-based companies to its “Entity List”, including existing customers of the Company. More recently, the U.S. government enacted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bars the importation into the United States of products made from forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China. The Chinese government could also enact laws and take actions that affect our business in China. We cannot predict what additional laws or actions may be taken by the U.S. or Chinese governments, but any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
​
In addition to the new laws outlined above, during the last few years there have also been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade policies and tariffs affecting China. These changes have, in certain cases, increased our costs of doing business. The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing or could make it more difficult for us to sell our products in some markets. Other countries where we operate or sell our products have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s or other countries’ trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.
​
In addition to the risks noted above, a number of other legal, economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations, such as:
​
 ● a global or regional economic slowdown in any of the Company’s market segments;

 ● postponement of customer spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other global economic factors;

 ● effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and/or fiscal policies in the United States and/or abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;

 ● intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars, cyberattacks and acts of terrorism or war;

 ● employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;

 ● industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;

 ● difficulties protecting intellectual property;

 ● longer payment cycles;

 ● changes in exchange control regulations, including any government actions that prohibit, limit or increase the cost of paying a dividend or otherwise moving cash between the Company’s subsidiaries located in different countries;

 ● credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

 ● changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company’s benefit plans; and

 ● the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

​
We face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to our Company during the first half of 2020, and to a lesser extent, those disruptions continued during the second half of 2020 and throughout all of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, particularly given the surge of cases resulting from the Omicron variant, we expect those disruptions to continue into 2022 and potentially beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During 2021 and into 2022, there have been resurgences in COVID-19 cases in several regions around the world, particularly related to new variant strains, including Delta and Omicron. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the impact of the recent resurgence of the crisis due to the Omicron variant, as well as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability, effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2022 and potentially beyond. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in the future.
​
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to increase the likelihood and potential severity of other risks (some discussed separately within this Item 1A. Risk Factors), including but not limited to, the following:
​
 ● Increased consumer demand, product shortages and supply chain and logistics challenges have caused, and may continue to result in, significant inflationary pressures that have and may continue to increase the Company’s costs of doing business.

​
 ● Our efforts to comply with any legally required vaccine mandates amongst some or all of our employees, could lead to increased labor attrition, along with potential difficulties in attracting and recruiting personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business and operations. In addition, employees in certain geographies could choose to take legal action against the Company if we institute vaccine mandates.

​
 ● A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have a significant negative impact on the ability of the Company, its suppliers and its customers to conduct business.

​
 ● Certain subsets of our employee population continue to work in a “hybrid” or remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This change may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information.

​
 ● Travel restrictions to certain countries, especially China, have limited our executive management’s ability to visit certain operations during the last two years and such restrictions could remain in place for all of 2022 and beyond.

​
 ● If the financial performance of our businesses were to decline significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.

​
 ● If there is a general market downturn and continued high degree of volatility in the financial markets, we may experience a material re-valuation of, for example, our pension assets and obligations.

​
The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers are experiencing difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing.
​
The Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third-party suppliers to secure these materials and components. The COVID-19 pandemic initially disrupted the supply of such raw materials and components, primarily in the first half of 2020. However, more recently, in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, we, along with many of our suppliers and customers, have experienced widespread supply chain disruptions that have resulted in significant cost increases across certain raw materials and components as well as some supply shortages, that collectively have had an adverse impact on our business and operating results. For example, the recent market shortage of semiconductors has caused disruptions, from both a supply and pricing standpoint, in some of the markets we serve, in particular, the automotive market. Recent inflationary pressures have been exacerbated by the lower availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers. While the Company has taken and continues to take measures to procure and obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components at acceptable prices from our suppliers, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to do so. Accordingly, any future delays, disruptions, and supply and pricing risks, such as the ongoing supply chain challenges and disruptions that we expect to continue during 2022, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
In limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. The cost and availability of raw materials may fluctuate significantly due to external factors including, but not limited to, product scarcity, disruptions caused by climate change and adverse weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, governmental policies and regulations such as trade tariffs, as well as pandemics and epidemics (such as, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic), which may, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
​
The Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change and global warming.
​
From time to time, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers, vendors, customers and distributors. Such extreme weather conditions and natural disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and stronger and longer-lasting weather patterns, and their consequences and effects have, in the past, temporarily disrupted our business operations both in the United States and abroad. These events could cause some of the Company’s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether, lost future business and sales, and/or damage to our property or harm to our people, each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.

Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.
​
Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”). As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws.
​
We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements. Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
​
The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.
​
The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible foreign currency restrictions and/or devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
The Company is dependent on attracting, recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled employees, including as part of our various management teams.
​
Our performance is dependent on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled personnel, including our executive and management teams. Given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate, the ability to identify and attract new talent, as well as retain existing talent, may prove to be difficult. It is possible that the current labor market could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, recruit, hire and retain skilled employees, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers around the world have re-assessed their career plans and priorities, which could lead to increased difficulty of the Company in retaining its experienced team members.
​
Risks related to our end markets
​
The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.
​
Approximately 42% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 12% of the Company’s 2021 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market. Demand for these products is subject

17

Table of Contents

to rapid technological change. In addition, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, a trend among customers has been to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Approximately 4% and 5% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company’s sales and profitability could be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.
​
Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Company’s sales.
​
Approximately 11% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products.
​
The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business.
​
The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Risks related to acquisitions
​
The Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.
​
The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including seven in 2021. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including but not limited to: managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In certain limited cases, the Company has pursued indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business, such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims, such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. We cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions.

The Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.
​
On December 31, 2021, the total assets of the Company were $14.7 billion, which included $6.4 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $756.9 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company’s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.
​
Risks related to our liquidity and capital resources
​
The Company’s credit agreement contains certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
​
The second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which also backstops the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program (“U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) and Euro commercial paper program (“Euro Commercial Paper Program”), contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company’s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company’s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $795.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Commercial Paper Program.
​
The Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company’s results.
​
The Company has used the global capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to downgrade the Company’s credit rating, it would likely increase the Company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
​
The Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.
​
The Company may be subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $804 million, or 17%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. A 10% change in floating interest rates at December 31, 2021 would not have a material effect on the Company’s interest expense. However, there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change more significantly.

Legal and regulatory risks
​
Cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.
​
Cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to malware, phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware and other increasingly sophisticated attacks, continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Globally, there has been an increased volume of cyber threats and ransomware attempts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Ransomware attacks have become easier to execute, and the rise of cryptocurrency has facilitated payments to criminals, making ransomware a more lucrative business. While the Company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, the impact of such attacks has not been material. Future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third-party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and/or misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information. Cybersecurity events could also result in the loss of or inability to access confidential information and critical business, financial or other data, and/or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase our susceptibility to cybersecurity incidents and risks, especially as some of our employees have transitioned and continue to work from home. Despite the Company’s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, release of highly sensitive confidential information, the inability to access critical data, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations and fines, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world.  This data relates to all aspects of our business, including financial information and current and future products under development, and also contains certain customer, supplier, partner and employee data.  We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us.  In addition, in certain cases, in order to conduct business, we outsource to third-party business partners.  We generally obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protection of our data; nonetheless, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyberattack.  Any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities.
​
The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, the state of California’s California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020, and more recently in August 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which became effective on November 1, 2021, impose significant requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results.
​
Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks.
​
We are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. and other governments, including laws and regulations governing performance of government contracts, the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. In the U.S., we may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. government or its suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or

20

Table of Contents

become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government, as noted herein in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The U.S. laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. We are subject to a wide range of similar laws and regulations in other countries throughout the world. Failure, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
​
In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If our contracts are terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are also prohibited from assigning prime U.S. government contracts without the prior consent of the U.S. government contracting officer. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
​
The Company is subject to governmental export and import controls.
​
Certain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargoes. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent U.S. administrations, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company’s customers based in China to its “Entity List”, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers, and such restrictions could further limit or prohibit the Company from selling products to such customers. If we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.
​
Changes in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company’s results.
​
The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions, and, in addition, new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.
​
Any future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company’s current and non-current tax liabilities, along with deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.
​
We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and, from time to time, we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in laws concerning intellectual property, or the enforcement of such laws, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.
​
The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties may include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. In addition, some foreign competitors may take advantage of the intellectual property laws in their home countries and the more favorable litigation and regulatory environment to our detriment. Third party claims of infringement may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.
​
The Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.
​
The Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty, indemnity and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, voluntary or forced product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand.
​
While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not respond and, where insurance exists, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. In some cases, particularly with respect to product warranty claims from customers, we self-insure against this risk, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from Company funds and not by insurance. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
​
The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.
​
The Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company’s former or current properties, either owned or leased. For example, as disclosed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company was named as one of several defendants in four separate lawsuits filed in the State of Indiana relating to a manufacturing site in Franklin, Indiana where the Company has been conducting an environmental clean-up effort under the direction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. All the costs incurred by the Company relating to these lawsuits as well as all costs associated with the clean-up effort at the manufacturing site have been reimbursed by the former owner pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the Company’s

business in 1987. Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise in any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
​
The Company may be subject to incremental costs and risks associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change.
​
There continues to be an increased global focus on climate change issues which has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts. In addition to the risks discussed under the heading “The Company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change and global warming,” the Company may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations or orders. For example, in early 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty focused on climate change, with several goals, including but not limited to, the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. More recently, in late 2021, the United States participated in the 2021 United National Climate Change Conference (“COP26”). At the COP26, participating countries agreed on a new climate change-focused deal, the Glasgow Climate Pact, which marks the first-ever climate deal to explicitly commit to a reduction in coal use. The COP26 also resulted in many countries pledging to end deforestation and reduce methane emissions, among other pledges.
​
Given our global manufacturing presence, any future increased regulation surrounding GHG emissions and other climate change-related laws and regulations, beyond initiatives already in process at the Company, could subject us to additional and/or unforeseen compliance costs and limitations, including increased energy and raw material costs and capital expenditures. Any future regulatory changes in any of the countries in which we operate could result in transition risks to the Company, including but not limited to (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way the Company operates, (ii) financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome, (iii) legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate change-related regulations, (iv) risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (v) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of the Company and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions, all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace. We are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements, pacts and/or regulations, if and when they are adopted and required, and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements, will affect our reputation, business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations in the future.

Item 2. Properties
​
The Company’s fixed assets include plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment. The Company’s plants, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2021, the Company operated approximately 230 manufacturing facilities with approximately 22.0 million square feet, of which approximately 15.0 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 4.0 million square feet, of which approximately 1.5 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located outside the U.S. had approximately 18.0 million square feet, of which approximately 13.5 million square feet were leased. The square footage by segment related to our manufacturing facilities was approximately 21.0 million square feet and approximately 1.0 million square feet for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and the Cable Products and Solutions segment, respectively.
​
The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.

The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2021. The additional shares were distributed on March 4, 2021, and the Company’s Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on March 5, 2021. As a result of the stock split, stockholders received one additional share of Common Stock for each share held as of the record date. All current and prior year data impacted by the stock split and presented throughout this Annual Report, including number of shares and per share information, earnings per share, and dividends per share amounts, among others, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the stock split.
​
In May 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

​
Repurchase of Equity Securities
​
In April 2018, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $2.0 billion of its Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $203.8 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As a result of these purchases, the Company completed all purchases authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program and, therefore, the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program has terminated. Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, 0.3 million shares, or $19.8 million, were retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 2.8 million shares, or $184.0 million, were retired by the Company.
​
On April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of its Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $457.9 million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 0.4 million shares, or $33.0 million, have been retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 5.8 million shares, or $424.9 million, have been or will be retired by the Company. From January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.0 million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, and, as of February 1, 2022, has remaining authorization to purchase up to $1,492.1 million of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Company’s Common Stock.

​
In 2021, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $10,876.3, $2,105.1 and $1,569.4, respectively, representing an increase of 26%, 28% and 30%, respectively, from 2020. In 2021, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $63.4 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises and (b) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by (c) acquisition-related expenses of $70.4 ($57.3 after-tax) comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”) in the second quarter of 2021 and external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) in the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2020, the Company’s net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits of $42.8 related to stock-based compensation resulting from stock option exercises and (b) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, partially offset by (c) acquisition-related expenses of $11.5 ($10.7 after-tax) comprised primarily of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7, increased by 32% and 34%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow”). The Company uses Operating Cash Flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its Common Stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2021, the Company generated Operating Cash Flow of $1,523.9 and Free Cash Flow of $1,167.2. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7.

Impact of COVID-19 on our Business, Operations, Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations
​
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to our Company during the first half of 2020, and to a lesser extent, those disruptions continued during the second half of 2020 and throughout all of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, particularly given the surge of cases resulting from the Omicron variant, we expect those disruptions to continue into 2022 and potentially beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During 2021 and into 2022, there have been resurgences in COVID-19 cases in several regions around the world, particularly related to new variant strains, including Delta and Omicron. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the impact of the recent resurgence of the crisis due to the Omicron variant, as well as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability, effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2022 and potentially For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A.

2021 Compared to 2020
​
Net sales were $10,876.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8,598.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in constant currencies, and 18% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. The increase in net sales in 2021 was driven by growth in several markets in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, as described below.
​
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) increased 27% in U.S. dollars, 25% in constant currencies, and 19% organically, in 2021, compared to 2020. The sales growth in 2021 was driven by strong growth across nearly all end markets, including the industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military and mobile networks markets, along with moderate growth in the mobile devices

market and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was partially offset by a decline in the commercial aerospace market, which continued to be negatively impacted by the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production. The strong sales growth in 2021 in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment also reflected a recovery in certain markets from the more negative impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $864.6), with broad-based growth across nearly all market segments of the global industrial market, with particular strength in heavy equipment, factory automation, industrial instrumentation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, alternative energy, rail mass transit, and transportation, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $683.4), reflecting the continued recovery and growth in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as the Company’s expanded position in next-generation electronics, including in particular electric and hybrid drive trains. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $482.7), driven primarily by continued strong sales growth to web service providers and broad-based market demand for server, storage and networking related products as customers worked to support higher demand for increased bandwidth. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $135.8), driven by strength across nearly all segments of the military market, including missile, military communications and naval and space-related applications, along with a recovery from the impact of pandemic-related production disruptions experienced during the first half of 2020, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $60.5), driven by a recovery in demand from mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, which was primarily driven by increased demand for products used in 5G network build-outs and contributions from acquisitions, offset in part by reductions of sales to certain customers in China that were added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s “Entity List”. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $45.7), driven by growth in products incorporated into laptops and wearable devices, along with production-related products, and was partially offset by moderations of sales into smartphones and tablets. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased (approximately $26.6) primarily due to the continued significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production.
​
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 4% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in constant currencies and 15% organically in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily driven by increased market demand from broadband operators and mobile network service providers, as well as the contribution from one acquisition in this segment that closed during the first quarter of 2021.

(1) Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.

(2) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.

(3) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current reporting year compared to the prior reporting year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the prior year’s net sales.

(4) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.

(5) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current year and/or prior comparable year presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.

(6) Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.

The increase in foreign net sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by strong growth in both Europe and Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $159.1, compared to 2020.
​
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,226.3, or 11.3% of net sales for 2021, compared to $1,014.2, or 11.8% of net sales for 2020. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2021 was driven primarily by higher sales during the year, relative to 2020 which was more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, slightly offset by the impact of MTS’s Sensors business, acquired in 2021, which currently has higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to the average of the Company. Administrative expenses increased $78.6 in 2021, and represented approximately 4.5% of net sales in 2021 and 4.8% of net sales in 2020. Research and development expenses increased $57.0 in 2021 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.9% of net sales in 2021 and 3.0% of net sales in 2020. Selling and marketing expenses increased $76.5 in 2021 compared to 2020, and represented approximately 3.8% of net sales in 2021 and 4.0% of net sales in 2020.
​
Operating income was $2,105.1, or 19.4% of net sales in 2021, compared to $1,638.4, or 19.1% of net sales in 2020. Operating income in 2021 included acquisition-related expenses of $70.4, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition in the second quarter of 2021, along with external transaction costs and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the Halo acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating income in 2020 included acquisition-related expenses of $11.5, comprised primarily of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. These acquisition-related expenses in 2021 and 2020 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $57.3, or $0.09 per share, and $10.7, or $0.02 per share, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $2,175.5 and 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2021, and $1,649.9 and 19.2% of net sales, respectively, in 2020. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2021 relative to 2020 was primarily driven by the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, as discussed further below.
​
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2021 was $2,296.8, or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,741.2, or 21.2% of net sales in 2020. The increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2021 compared to 2020 is driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021.
​
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2021 was $22.8, or 5.1% of net sales, compared to $35.4, or 9.6% of net sales in 2020. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2021 compared to 2020 is driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity, logistics and supply chain environment experienced in 2021.
​
Interest expense was $115.5 in 2021 compared to $115.4 in 2020. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.
​
Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 20.6% in 2021 and 20.5% in 2020. Provision for income taxes in 2021 included (i) excess tax benefits of $63.4 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $14.9 related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, all of which was partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2020 included (i) excess tax benefits of $42.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, which were partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.3% and 24.5% for 2021 and 2020, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2020 Compared to 2019
​
Net sales were $8,598.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,225.4 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currencies, and 2% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. The increase in net sales in 2020 was driven by strong growth in several markets, which was partially offset by the sudden and severe slowdown in certain of our markets resulting from the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also caused production disruptions in many parts of the world during much of the first half of 2020.
​
Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currencies, and 2% organically, in 2020, compared to 2019. The sales growth was driven by strong growth in the industrial, information technology and data communications, and mobile devices markets, along with moderate growth in the military market, and contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was partially offset by declines in the commercial aerospace, mobile networks and automotive markets, all of which were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $246.4), primarily driven by strength in battery and electric vehicle, industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment, alternative energy and medical applications, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $234.0), driven primarily by strong sales growth to data center customers and market demand for storage and networking related products as customers worked to support higher demand for increased bandwidth to support work, school and entertainment activities during the pandemic, along with contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $179.9), driven by strength in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearable devices, and accessories along with production-related products, and was partially offset by a slight moderation of sales into smartphones. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $32.2), driven by strength across multiple segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of pandemic-related production disruptions experienced during the first half of the year. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased significantly (approximately $135.3) primarily due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Net sales

to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $98.5), which reflected the impact of the 2019 U.S. Government restrictions on certain Chinese customers as well as reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, partially as a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset in part by contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market decreased (approximately $86.0), due to a significant reduction in demand resulting from customer factory shutdowns together with production disruptions in the first half of 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by a strong recovery of demand during the second half of the year.
​
Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 4% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 4% in U.S. dollars, 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was largely driven by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily during the first half of 2020, as well as an overall weakness in market demand.

(6) Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.

​
The increase in foreign net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven primarily by strong growth in Asia. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2019.
​
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,014.2, or 11.8% of net sales for 2020, compared to $971.4, or 11.8% of net sales for 2019. Administrative expenses increased $27.5 in 2020, and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2020 and 4.7% of net sales in 2019. Research and development expenses increased $26.5 in 2020 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 3.0% of net sales in 2020 and 2.8% of net sales in 2019. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $11.2 in 2020 compared to 2019, and represented approximately 4.0% of net sales in 2020 and 4.3% of net sales in 2019.
​
Operating income was $1,638.4, or 19.1% of net sales in 2020, compared to $1,619.2, or 19.7% of net sales in 2019. Operating income in 2020 included acquisition-related expenses of $11.5, comprised primarily of external transaction costs related to acquisitions that were announced or closed. Operating income in 2019 included acquisition-related expenses of $25.4, comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with the acquired backlog resulting from two of our 2019 acquisitions, with the remainder representing external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses in 2020 and 2019 had the effect of decreasing net income from continuing operations by $10.7, or $0.02 per share, and $21.0, or $0.03 per share, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses are separately

presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,649.9 and 19.2% of net sales, respectively, in 2020, and $1,644.6 and 20.0% of net sales, respectively, in 2019.
​
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2020 was $1,741.2, or 21.2% of net sales, compared to $1,722.7, or 22.0% of net sales in 2019. The decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the significant incremental costs incurred, primarily during the first half of 2020, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease in the operating margin during the first half of 2020 was partly offset by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes during the second half of 2020.
​
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2020 was $35.4, or 9.6% of net sales, compared to $39.5, or 10.2% of net sales in 2019. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower volumes as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily during the first half of 2020.
​
Interest expense was $115.4 in 2020 compared to $117.6 in 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.
​
Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $14.3 in 2019, which related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) and 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”) (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in September 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Tendered Notes.
​
Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 20.5% in 2020 and 22.2% in 2019. Provision for income taxes in 2020 included (i) excess tax benefits of $42.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) a discrete tax benefit of $19.9 related to the settlements of refund claims in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, which were partially offset by the tax effects related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of decreasing the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. Provision for income taxes in 2019 included excess tax benefits of $38.1 from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by the tax effects related to (i) acquisition-related expenses during the year and (ii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. These items Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% for both 2020 and 2019, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Diluted EPS were $1,203.4 and $1.96, respectively, for 2020, compared to $1,155.0 and $1.88, respectively, for 2019. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items discussed above, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,151.4 and $1.87, respectively, for 2020, compared to $1,150.4 and $1.87, respectively, for 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
​
Liquidity and Cash Requirements
​
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,241.4 and $1,738.1, respectively, with the majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand located outside of the United States. On April 7, 2021, the Company used a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its U.S. Commercial Paper Program (defined below) to fund the acquisition of MTS. In addition, on December 1, 2021, the Company used cash on hand to fund the acquisition of Halo.
​
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined and discussed further below within this Item 7).  The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash from operating activities, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the Company’s $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.200% Senior Notes due September 15, 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes”) in September 2021, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program), provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term (next twelve months) and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations.
​
Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations
​
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and working capital needs, capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of our Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) which is payable in annual installments until 2025, taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), funding of pension obligations, and other contractual obligations and commitments (refer to the table below for the Company’s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, and to the extent of any amounts outstanding, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2022 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.

The following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to certain contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2021, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments are expected to be satisfied.

(1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2021, were approximately $2.4. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by items such as future acquisitions, repurchases of Common Stock and dividend payments, as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.

​
(2) The Company’s operating lease payments included in this table reflect the future minimum undiscounted fixed lease payments, which serve as the basis for calculating the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021. The table above excludes any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, due to their uncertainty. Finance leases are not material to the Company individually or in the aggregate and as such have been excluded from the table above.

​
(3) Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production.

​
(4) This table includes estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans, the most significant funded plan of which covers certain of its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in the United States (“U.S. Plans”) due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2022. The Company did not make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. Plans in 2021 and 2020. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2022 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.

​
(5) As a result of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) in December 2017, the United States changed to a modified territorial tax system, which significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed the Transition Tax associated with all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted and finalized in 2018. The Transition Tax is to be paid in annual installments over the eight-year period until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. The table above reflects the remaining amounts associated with the Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions. The fourth installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the second quarter of 2021.

​
(6) As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded net liabilities of approximately $176.5 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows. It is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid.

​
Repatriation of Foreign Earnings and Related Income Taxes
​
Following the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company has previously indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2021 accumulated earnings and has accrued the foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings, as appropriate. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining pre-2021 foreign earnings. The Company intends to distribute certain 2021 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, where applicable, on those earnings, as of December 31, 2021, and intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 2021 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2021 earnings for repatriation, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,000 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.

Note: Net cash change from discontinued operations in the table above includes the proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business during the year ended December 31, 2021, as discussed in further detail later within this Item 7.
​
Operating Activities
​
The ability to generate cash from operating activities has been one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow”) was $1,523.9 in 2021, compared to $1,592.0 in 2020 and $1,502.3 in 2019. The decrease in Operating Cash Flow in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to a higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below, partially offset by an increase in net income from continuing operations. The increase in Operating Cash Flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the increase in net income from continuing operations, along with a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital as discussed below.
​
In 2021, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $496.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $398.4, $263.0 and $20.2, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $131.7 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $53.5. In 2020, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $38.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $146.3, $102.0 and $88.6, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $204.3 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $93.7. In 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $81.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $129.3 and accounts payable of $60.2, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $117.3.
​
The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Accounts receivable increased $503.2 to $2,454.8 primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, along with the impact of the seven acquisitions (collectively, the “2021 Acquisitions”) that closed during 2021, in particular the MTS and Halo acquisitions, all of which was partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes (“Translation”) at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 71 days and 72 days, respectively. Inventories increased $431.9 to $1,894.1, primarily due to higher sales, along with the impact of our 2021 Acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 80 days and 79 days, respectively. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $29.0 to $367.9, primarily due to increases in certain prepaid expenses and other current receivables as well as the impact of the 2021 Acquisitions. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $120.7 to $1,175.3, primarily due to capital expenditures of $360.4 and the impact of the 2021 Acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $302.9, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $1,344.7 to $6,376.8, resulting from goodwill recognized related to the 2021 Acquisitions, primarily from the MTS and Halo acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Other intangible assets, net, increased $359.4 to $756.9 due to the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the 2021 Acquisitions, primarily from the MTS and Halo acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $86.4 related to the Company’s intangible assets. Other long-term assets increased $58.9 to $411.2, primarily due to increases in (i) overfunded pension plans primarily in the U.S. and (ii) operating lease right-of-use assets resulting from both leases assumed from the 2021 Acquisitions as well as new and renewed lease agreements entered into during the year. Accounts payable increased $191.3 to $1,312.0, primarily as a result of increased purchasing activity related to higher sales levels, along with the

Table of Contents

impact of the 2021 Acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 56 days and 61 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $177.8 to $1,131.1, primarily as a result of the MTS acquisition and the other 2021 Acquisitions, along with an increase in accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits, and other accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in accrued income taxes, primarily resulting from U.S. federal tax payments. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $35.2 to $193.4, primarily due to the impact of higher discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation, along with Translation. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased $156.6 to $862.9, primarily as a result of an increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the MTS and Halo acquisitions, along with an increase in long-term operating lease liabilities resulting from both leases assumed from the 2021 Acquisitions as well as new and renewed lease agreements entered into during the year.
​
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $6.8, $6.5 and $6.6, respectively. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the Company’s U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future, as discussed in more detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by the increase in capital expenditures to support our strong sales growth and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in capital expenditures. The following table is on a continuing operations basis only and excludes any cash flows related to discontinued operations:
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
--------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ------- ---- - ------- - - -------
​ 2021 2020 2019
Operating Cash Flow (GAAP) $ 1,523.9 $ 1,592.0 $ 1,502.3
Capital expenditures (GAAP) ​ (360.4) ​ (276.8) ​ (295.0)
Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (GAAP) ​ 3.7 ​ 12.7 ​ 7.4
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) ​ $ 1,167.2 ​ $ 1,327.9 ​ $ 1,214.7

​
Investing Activities
​
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, purchases (sales and maturities) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions.
​
Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $2,604.4 in 2021, compared to $333.5 in 2020 and $1,228.8 in 2019. In 2021, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by the use of $2,225.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $356.7, and net purchases of short-term investments of $8.6. In 2020, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $264.1, the use of $50.4 to fund acquisitions, and net purchases of short-term investments of $18.4. In 2019, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by the use of $937.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $287.6, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.8.
​
Financing Activities
​
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of Common Stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests.
​
Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $145.1 in 2021, compared to $516.6 in 2020 and $648.4 in 2019. In 2021, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by (i) debt repayments of $912.6, primarily related to the repayment of the assumed outstanding MTS senior notes in the

second quarter of 2021 as well as the redemption of the 3.125% Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2021 and the redemption of the 4.00% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2021, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $661.7, (iii) dividend payments of $346.7, (iv) a cash transfer of $28.7 made by the Company’s continuing operations to its discontinued operations in order to fund the September 2021 payment of contingent consideration assumed as part of the MTS acquisition, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.9, (vi) payments of $9.3 related to debt financing costs associated with the 2031 Senior Notes, and (vii) payments of $4.1 associated with the deferred purchase price related to acquisitions, partially offset by (a) net borrowings of $796.3 primarily under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the majority of the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and to redeem the 3.125% Senior Notes and the 4.00% Senior Notes, (b) net cash proceeds of $752.1, primarily related to the September 2021 issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, and (c) cash proceeds of $288.5 from the exercise of stock options. In 2020, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $641.3, (ii) debt repayments of $404.4 related to the Company’s 2.20% U.S. Senior Notes due April 2020 and other debt, (iii) net repayments of $385.8 related to the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs, (iv) dividend payments of $297.6, (v) payment of $75.0 related to acquisition-related contingent consideration, (vi) payment of $16.2 associated with the deferred purchase price related to an acquisition, (vii) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $14.9, (vii) payments of $8.7 related to debt financing costs primarily associated with the 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Euro Notes (each as defined below), and (viii) net repayments of $0.7 under the Company’s credit facilities, partially offset by (a) aggregate net cash proceeds of $942.3 from both the February 2020 issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes and the May 2020 issuance of the 2026 Euro Notes and (b) cash proceeds of $385.7 from the exercise of stock options. In 2019, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven primarily by (i) the aggregate debt repayments of $1,111.5 associated with certain of the Company’s senior notes (the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) and other long-term debt, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock of $601.7, (iii) dividend payments of $279.5, (iv) net repayments of $229.0 related to the Company’s Commercial Paper Programs, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $43.3, (vi) payments of $14.9 related to debt financing costs primarily associated with the Revolving Credit Facility, the 4.350% Senior Notes due June 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”), and the 2.800% Senior Notes due February 2030 (the “2030 Senior Notes”), and (vii) premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by (a) aggregate net cash proceeds of $1,398.8 from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes and (b) cash proceeds of $246.1 from the exercise of stock options.
​
The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
​
On November 30, 2021, the Company amended and restated its $2,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As a result, the Revolving Credit Facility no longer references LIBOR for interest rate determinations. The Revolving Credit Facility maintains the lenders’ aggregate commitments under the facility at $2,500.0. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in November 2026 and gives the Company the ability to borrow, in various currencies, at a spread that varies based on the Company’s debt rating over certain currency-specific benchmark rates, which benchmark rates in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
 ​
The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0. On April 7, 2021, a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand were used to fund the acquisition of MTS. The Company also used borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program to (i) redeem, in the third quarter of 2021, its unsecured 3.125% Senior Notes due September 15, 2021, of which $227.7 aggregate principal amount was outstanding and (ii) redeem, in the fourth quarter of 2021, its unsecured 4.00% Senior Notes due February 1, 2022, of which $295.0 aggregate principal amount was outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of USCP Notes outstanding was $795.2, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.29%.
​

In July 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. dollars or other currencies. The maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0. As of December 31, 2021, there were no ECP Notes outstanding.
​
Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2021, the authorization from the Board limits the maximum principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper or similar programs, along with outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, at any time to $2,500.0 in the aggregate.  The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and, based on the Board’s authorization described above, are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.
​
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:
​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
--------- ----- -------- ----- -------- -------------------------
Principal Interest ​

​
On September 14, 2021, the Company issued the 2031 Senior Notes due September 15, 2031. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.
​
On February 20, 2020, the Company issued $400.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.050% Senior Notes due March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”). On April 1, 2020, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2025 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay the $400.0 outstanding principal amount of unsecured 2.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2020 upon maturity.
​
All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (the “U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.
​
On May 4, 2020, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $545.4 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 0.750% Senior Notes due May 4, 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes”). The Company used the net proceeds from the 2026 Euro Notes to repay amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility.
​
In 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 (the “2028 Euro Notes”, collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes, “Euro Notes”, and collectively with the 2026 Euro Notes and the U.S. Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.
​
The Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s and the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the

Company. Interest on each series of Euro Notes is payable annually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Euro Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.
​
The Senior Notes impose certain obligations on the Company and prohibit various actions by the Company unless it satisfies certain financial requirements. On December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all requirements under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.
​
In April 2018, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $203.8 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As a result of these purchases, the Company completed all purchases authorized or $19.8, were retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 2.8 million shares, or $184.0, were retired by the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased 12.0 million and 13.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $641.3 and $601.7, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2020, 2.7 million shares, or $153.9, were retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 9.3 million shares, or $487.4, were retired by the Company. Of the total repurchases made in 2019, 2.0 million shares, or $87.6, were retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 11.1 million shares, or $514.1, were retired by the Company.
​
On April 27, 2021, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 27, 2024 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $457.9 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases made in 2021 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, 0.4 million shares, or $33.0, have been retained in Treasury stock at the time of repurchase; the remaining 5.8 million shares, or $424.9, have been or will be retired by the Company. From January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 0.6 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $50.0 under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, and, as of February 1, 2022, has remaining authorization to purchase up to $1,492.1 of its Common Stock under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock options exercised by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends paid, economic and market conditions and the price of the Company’s Common Stock.
​
Contingent upon declaration by the Board, the Company pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On October 20, 2020, the Board approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.125 per share to $0.145 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2020, and then on October 26, 2021, approved a further increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.145 per share to $0.20 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2021, contingent upon declaration by the Board.

LIBOR Transition
​
In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In December 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration published a consultation on its intention to extend the publication of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”) rates until June 30, 2023. Subsequently in March 2021, the FCA announced some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the SOFR as its preferred benchmark alternative to USD LIBOR. The SOFR represents a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is calculated based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. In March 2020, in response to this transition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance providing certain optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued by reference rate reform, and addresses operational issues likely to arise in modifying contracts to replace discontinued reference rates with new rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued further clarifying guidance surrounding derivatives, as it relates to this transition. Effective November 30, 2021, the Revolving Credit Facility no longer references LIBOR for interest rate determinations. Due to our current limited reliance on borrowings tied to LIBOR, the Company currently believes that the LIBOR transition will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
​
Pensions
​
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. The majority of U.S. employees are not covered by the U.S. Plans and are instead covered by various defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations associated with the Company’s underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2021 to $173.9 from $211.0 in 2020, primarily due to the impact of higher discount rates on our projected benefit obligation, along with actual returns on plan assets. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future.
​
Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
​
Acquisitions and Divestitures
​
During 2021, the Company completed seven acquisitions for $2,225.4, net of cash acquired, while also completing the divestiture of the Divested MTS business, as defined and discussed below. All but one of the 2021 Acquisitions were included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The 2021 Acquisitions were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company.
​
Acquisition of MTS
​
On April 7, 2021, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated December 9, 2020, by and among the Company and MTS Systems Corporation (“MTS”), the Company completed the acquisition of MTS for a total enterprise value of approximately $1,700, net of cash acquired and including the repayment of all outstanding debt and certain liabilities. The MTS acquisition was funded through a combination of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and cash on hand. At closing, the Company paid approximately $1,300, net of cash acquired, for 100% of the common stock of MTS, including certain liabilities settled at closing, which is reflected within Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company also assumed MTS’s then-outstanding $350.0 principal amount of senior notes due August 15, 2027. Shortly after the closing, the Company repaid and settled the MTS senior notes for approximately $387.3, which included accrued interest and a make-whole premium incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of the senior notes. The repayment of the outstanding senior notes, including the make-whole premium and excluding

42

Table of Contents

interest, was reflected within Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. Prior to the acquisition, MTS was a leading global supplier of precision sensors, advanced test systems and motion simulators. MTS was historically organized into two business segments: Sensors (“MTS Sensors”) and Test & Simulation (“MTS T&S”). The MTS Sensors business provides the Company with a highly complementary offering of high-technology, harsh environment sensors sold into diverse end markets and applications. The MTS Sensors business further expands the Company’s range of sensor and sensor-based products across a wide array of industries and is reported as part of our continuing operations and within our Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company incurred $55.4 ($44.6 after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) of acquisition-related expenses, comprised primarily of transaction, severance, restructuring and certain non-cash purchase accounting costs related to the MTS acquisition.
​
Sale of the Divested MTS Business
​
On January 19, 2021 and prior to the closing of the MTS acquisition, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) to Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”). Throughout this Annual Report, we refer to MTS (including the MTS T&S business, but excluding the MTS Sensors business) as the “Divested MTS business”. As a result of the agreement to sell the Divested MTS business to ITW, the Company concluded that the Divested MTS business met the discontinued operations reporting criteria and “held for sale” accounting criteria as of the MTS acquisition date of April 7, 2021, and consequently, the Company did not assign the Divested MTS business to either of its two reportable business segments. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the operating results and related cash flows associated with the Divested MTS business as discontinued operations through the date of its sale to ITW in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Income from discontinued operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, net of income taxes, was $21.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021. On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the Divested MTS business for approximately $750, net of cash divested and excluding related transaction fees and expenses. The proceeds from the sale of the Divested MTS business were included in Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amphenol has no continuing involvement with the Divested MTS business now that its sale has been consummated. After giving effect to the sale of the Divested MTS business as well as the repayment of the aforementioned MTS senior notes as part of the MTS acquisition, the Company paid approximately $950, net of cash acquired and excluding related transaction fees and expenses, for the retained MTS Sensors business. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the completed divestiture of the Divested MTS business.
​
Acquisition of Halo Technology Limited
​
On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 97% of the common stock of Halo Technology Limited (“Halo”) for a purchase price of approximately $694, net of cash acquired. The sellers retained a less than 3% noncontrolling interest in Halo, which includes redeemable features that are outside the control of the Company and therefore, has been classified as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, as discussed in more detail in Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Halo, which is headquartered in the United States (California), is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components, with product offerings that are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic interconnect solutions for the communications infrastructure markets. The operating results for Halo have been included within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date.
​
For further discussion of the Company’s acquisitions, as well as the Company’s discontinued operations and completed divestiture of the Divested MTS business, refer to Note 11 and Note 12, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
Environmental Matters
​
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For more information on certain environmental matters, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation and Costs
​
The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. From time to time, the Company may encounter difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company. While the Company does not currently anticipate any significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, beginning in 2021 and into 2022, there have been supply chain and logistical challenges that have impacted the global economy, including our Company, and have caused supply constraints and commodity price increases on certain raw materials and components used by the Company in production, as well as lower availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea and ground freight. Consequently, the Company may risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company and certain of its suppliers and customers are experiencing difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of most of the Company’s raw materials and components is increasing” in Part I, Item 1A herein.
​
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
​
The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies, including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein.
​
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
​
In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Board and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS from continuing operations exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in the presentation of such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions.  Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures presented within this Item 7 are on a continuing operations basis only and exclude any results associated with discontinued operations. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items.
​
The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the

Table of Contents

most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7:
​
 ● Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

​
 ● Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.

​
 ● Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income from continuing operations attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.

​
 ● Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.

​
 ● Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income).

​
 ● Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.

​
 ● Free Cash Flow is defined as (i) Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less (ii) capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), all of which are derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to stockholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.

​
 ● Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of (i) changes in foreign currency exchange rates (described above), which is outside the control of the Company, and (ii) acquisitions, both of which are taken as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales. The acquisition impact represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current year period(s) and/or prior comparable year period(s) presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.

Critical Accounting Estimates
​
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical since they require significant assumptions and judgments that inherently are subject to risks and uncertainties. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
Revenue Recognition
​
Topic 606
​
The Company’s net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price.
​
The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point or (ii) when the product arrives at its destination. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
Standard product warranty coverage, which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, is typically offered, while extended or separately priced warranty coverage is typically not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge. We estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience, product history, and current trends.

Income Taxes
​
Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes.  The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $1,000 related to certain geographies, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated. In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered.
​
The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
​
As a result of the Tax Act, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.

Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 3, 2021: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2022 $ 711 2023 471 2024 174 2025 18 2026 7 Thereafter -- Total $ 1,381 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $202 million, $176 million and $154 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have direct...

(4)As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance Corporation ("General Finance"), which was a leading provider of mobile storage equipment and modular office space. Prior to the General Finance acquisition, we did not rent material amounts of such equipment. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in "Management's Discussion and Anal...

Note 9 -- Derivative Instruments During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into two foreign currency swap agreements. The objective of both agreements is to manage the risk of changes in cash flows resulting from foreign currency gains/losses realized upon remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated SCL senior notes by swapping a specified amount of Hong Kong dollars for U.S. dollars at the contractual spot rate. The terms in one of the contracts did not effectively match the terms of the related SCL senior notes; thus, it was not designated as hedging (the "Non-Hedging Swap"). The remaining contract was designated as a hedge of the cash flows related to a portion of the SCL senior notes (the "Hedging Swap," and together with the Non-Hedging Swap, the "FX Swaps"). The Non-Hedging Swap and the Hedging Swap have a total notional value of $500 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and expire in August 2023 and August 2025, respectively. The total fair value of the FX Swaps is recorded as an asset in other assets, net. The fair value of the FX Swaps was estimated using Level 2 inputs from recently reported market transactions of foreign currency exchange rates. For the Hedging Swap, the changes in fair value of the derivative were recognized as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the foreign currency gains/losses incurred from the remeasurement of the portion of the SCL senior notes being hedged were also recognized in other comprehensive income. For the Non-Hedging Swap the changes in fair value of the derivative were recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In August 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements (the "IR Swaps"), which qualified and were designated as fair value hedges, swapping fixed-rate for variable-rate interest to hedge changes in the fair value of the 2023, 2025 and 2028 SCL Senior Notes. These IR Swaps had a total not...

In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2021, $17.4 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.
