Execution of capital strategy

2021 capital strategy

During 2021, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy, as described below.

Maintained access to diverse sources of capital strategically important to our long-term capital structure

•Generated significant cash flows from operating activities
In 2021, we funded approximately $230 million of our equity capital needs with cash flows from operating activities.

•Continued strategic value harvesting through real estate dispositions and partial interest sales
In 2021, these sales generated a record $2.6 billion of capital for investment into our highly leased development and redevelopment projects and strategic acquisitions. In relation to these transactions, we recorded gains or consideration in excess of book value aggregating $1.1 billion.

•Achieved significant growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $299.6 million, or 23%, during 2021, which allowed us to:
•Improve our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (fourth quarter of 2021 annualized) ratio to 5.2x from 5.3x, the lowest in 10 years, and fund $1.6 billion of growth on a leverage-neutral basis.
•Take advantage of favorable capital market environment and opportunistically issue on a leverage-neutral basis unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $1.75 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.49% and a weighted-average maturity of 20.4 years, a portion of the proceeds from which was used to refinance our 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2024.

•Continued disciplined management of common equity issuances to support growth in FFO per share, as adjusted, and NAV
In 2021, the aforementioned internally generated capital enabled us to meet our capital requirements while prudently limiting the amount of equity issuances to 20.8 million shares of common stock sold under our forward equity sales agreements and ATM common stock offering program for net proceeds of $3.5 billion.

Maintained a strong and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity

•$3.8 billion liquidity as of December 31, 2021.
•Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA of 5.2x and fixed-charge coverage ratio of 5.3x for the three months ended December 31, 2021, annualized, representing the best ratios in the past 10 years.
•Total debt and preferred stock to gross assets of 26% as of December 31, 2021.
•Weighted-average remaining term of debt of 12.1 years as of December 31, 2021, with no debt maturing prior to 2024.
•Total equity capitalization of $35.2 billion is in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. REITs as of December 31, 2021.

Continued to strengthen our credit profile

•In October 2021, S&P Global Ratings upgraded our corporate issuer credit rating outlook to BBB+/Positive from BBB+/Stable.
•As of December 31, 2021, our investment-grade credit ratings ranked in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. REITs.

2022 capital strategy

During 2022, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit profile, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Consistent with 2021, our capital strategy for 2022 includes the following elements:

•Allocate capital to Class A properties located in life science, agtech, and tech campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters;
•Maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in EBITDA, strategic value harvesting and asset recycling through real estate disposition and partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, and other capital;
•Continue to improve our credit profile;
•Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•Prudently ladder debt maturities and manage short-term variable-rate debt;
•Prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;
•Maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity.

The anticipated delivery of significant incremental EBITDA from our development and redevelopment of new Class A properties is expected to enable us to continue to debt fund a significant portion of our development and redevelopment projects on a leverage-neutral basis. We expect to continue to maintain access to diverse sources of capital, including unsecured senior notes payable, and secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. We expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. We intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and equity capital. For further information, refer to the “Projected results”, “Sources of Capital,” and “Uses of Capital” sections under this Item 7. Our ability to meet our 2022 capital strategy objectives and expectations will depend in part on capital market conditions, real estate market conditions, and other factors beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives and expectations. Refer to our discussion of “Forward-looking statements” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Climate Change and Sustainability

We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. For example, most of our properties are located along the east and west coasts of the U.S. and some of our properties are located in close proximity to shorelines. To the extent that climate change impacts weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, wild fires, droughts, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties, delays in construction and resulting increased construction costs, or in our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, and by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. We continue to evaluate our asset base for potential exposure to the following climate-related risks: sea level rise and increases in heavy rain, flood, drought, extreme heat, and wildfire. As a part of Alexandria’s risk management program, we purchase property insurance to mitigate the risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters. However, our insurance may not adequately cover all of our potential losses. As a result, there can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.

Board of Directors and Leadership Oversight

The Audit Committee of Alexandria’s Board of Directors oversees the management of the company’s financial and other systemic risks, including those related to climate. At a management level, Alexandria’s Sustainability Committee, which comprises members of the executive team and senior decision makers spanning the company’s Real Estate Development, Asset Management, Risk, and Sustainability teams, leads the development and execution of our approach to climate-related risk.

Proactively Managing and Mitigating Climate Risk

The resilience of our properties under a changing climate is paramount both for our business and our tenants’ mission-critical research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts. We consider the potential impacts associated with climate change and extreme weather conditions in the acquisition, design, development, and operation of our buildings and campuses. We align our climate change management efforts with the guidelines issued by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), which we endorsed in 2018. Our industry-leading environmental initiatives, programs, and policies and our proactive approach to the identification and management of evolving physical conditions and transition issues continue to raise the bar in the industry for mitigating greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and bolstering climate resilience.

As further detailed in the “Monitoring and Preparing for Transition” subsection below, over the past few years, regulatory bodies in most of our regions have either passed or proposed legislation to limit the carbon footprint of buildings, require procurement of clean power, or eliminate natural gas from new construction projects. Additionally, certain U.S. jurisdictions incorporated guidelines into their building codes to address the up-front impacts of building materials such as concrete. Moreover, our tenant preferences for green, efficient, and healthy buildings continue to rise. As of December 31, 2021, 80% of Alexandria’s top 20 tenants (by annual rental revenue) have set net-zero carbon and/or carbon neutrality goals, compared to 50% of our top 20 tenants as of December 31, 2020. As a result of our own sustainability mission compelling us to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate risk, as well as the changing regulatory environment and our tenants’ expectations, we have implemented a comprehensive approach to assessing and mitigating physical risk to our properties as well as to preparing for the transition, as described below.

Assessing and Mitigating Physical Risk to Our Properties

 In accordance with TCFD methodology, we consider a range of scenarios for 2030 and 2050 when evaluating physical risk to our properties: (1) a business-as-usual scenario in which GHG emissions continue to increase with time (Representative Concentration Pathways (“RCP”) 8.5); and (2) a mitigation scenario in which GHG emissions level off by 2050 and decline thereafter (RCP 4.5). To ensure a conservative evaluation of potential risk at the asset level, we use the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has greater climate hazard impacts than RCP 4.5. These climate change assessments covering both acute and chronic risks enable us to assess preparedness for climate-related risks across the real estate life cycle.

For our property acquisitions, our risk management and sustainability teams conduct climate change evaluations and advise the transactions and property teams of any need for potential property upgrades, which are evaluated in our financial modeling and transactional decisions.

For our developments and redevelopments of new Class A properties, we evaluate the potential impact of sea level rise, storm surges in coastal or tidal locations, and changing temperatures out to the year 2050. As feasible, we design for the potential need to add cooling infrastructure to meet future building needs while maintaining flexibility and optimizing infrastructure funds for more immediate needs. In water-scarce areas, we aim to plant drought-resistant vegetation and prepare buildings to connect to a municipal recycled-water infrastructure where available and feasible. In areas prone to wildfire, we incorporate brush management practices into landscape design and may also include enhanced air filtration systems to support safe, healthy indoor air under extreme air pollution conditions.

103

At our buildings in operation, we evaluate to what extent we have mitigations in place and which operational and physical improvements can be made where potential concerns have been identified. For example, resilience measures implemented at some of our properties include the following: in areas prone to floods we position critical building mechanical equipment on the roofs or significantly above the projected potential flood elevations; we purchase temporary flood barriers that we store on-site and can deploy at building entrances prior to a flood event; we elevate property entrances or the first floor above projected present day and future flood elevations; we install backflow preventors on storm/sewer utilities that discharge from the building; and we waterproof the building envelope up to the projected flood elevation. In areas prone to fire, and to the extent feasible, we locate our properties away from large fire hazards, such as large grassy or brush areas; our landscaping vegetation consists of less flammable vegetation species that are positioned in a reasonable distance from a property; our building envelopes are constructed with fire-resistant materials and are sealed; and in the event of fire, our HVAC systems are able to filtrate smoke particulates in the air.

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ASSESSING & MITIGATING PHYSICAL RISK

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisitions
•Conduct climate change assessment.
•Incorporate potential mitigation strategies, where applicable, into financial modeling and transactional decisions.
Developments and Redevelopments
•Review climate change assessment.
•Assess potential risks and account for 2050 climate projections and an RCP 8.5 scenario.
•Consider physical and operational measures in design to increase the property’s resilience.
•Identify operational mitigation measures and ongoing monitoring opportunities.
Buildings in Operation
•For new and redeveloped assets transitioning into operations:
•Consider implementation and prioritization of operational mitigation measures and ongoing monitoring.
•For existing assets:
•Review climate change assessment.
•Where potential risks have been identified, assess to what extent mitigation measures are in place and which operational and physical improvements can be made to increase the property’s resilience.
•Develop an implementation plan.

Monitoring and Preparing for Transition

Globally, public concern regarding climate change has been growing rapidly. To join efforts and to accelerate action to reduce GHG emissions, on November 13, 2021, nearly 200 countries attended the United Nations’ annual climate summit, COP26, and adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact (the “Pact”), which includes terms to strengthen efforts to address climate change by building resilience, reducing GHG emissions, providing additional funding from developed to developing countries, and limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Pact for the first time includes language that calls upon countries to reduce their reliance on coal power and roll back inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. A number of other notable agreements were made during the COP26 summit, including, among others, an agreement between the U.S. and the EU to spearhead an initiative to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. It is unknown how or if the Pact’s measures will be carried out effectively or whether these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the effects of climate change over time.

In August 2021, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a detailed report titled “Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis” that provides a comprehensive evidence of the catastrophic impact of GHG emissions on climate change, including increases in severe and dangerous weather conditions. According to the latest data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”), the U.S. is responsible for approximately 15% of the global GHG emissions. To combat the cause of global warming domestically, President Biden identified climate change as one of his top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the U.S. to eliminate net GHG pollution by 2050. In April 2021, President Biden announced his plan to reduce the U.S. GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030. These environmental goals earned a prominent place in President Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which was signed into law on November 15, 2021. It is not yet known what impact this law may have on our properties, business operations, or our tenants.

104

Numerous states and municipalities have adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets, including, but not limited to, the following:

•In California, State Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation in September 2021 aimed at achieving net-zero GHG emissions associated with cement used within the state no later than 2045. In November 2020, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted an All-Electric New Construction Ordinance that will require all new buildings (residential and non-residential) with initial building permit applications made on or after June 1, 2021 to have all-electric indoor and outdoor space-conditioning, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying systems. In addition, in September 2020, Mr. Newsom signed an executive order requiring all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state to be emission free by 2035. Also in September 2018, Senate Bill 100 was signed into law in California, accelerating the state’s renewable portfolio standard target dates and setting a policy of meeting 100% of retail electricity sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

•In Massachusetts, Senate Bill 9 was signed into law in March 2021, updating the state’s climate policy to ensure net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and establishing interim emission reduction targets for several sectors, including commercial and industrial buildings.

•In New York, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act was signed into law in July 2019, establishing a statewide framework to reduce net GHG emissions to no less than 85% below 1990 levels by 2050. Also, in May 2019, New York City enacted Local Law 97 as a part of the Climate Mobilization Act aimed at reducing GHG emissions by 80% from commercial and residential buildings by 2050. Starting in 2024, this law will place carbon caps on most buildings larger than 25,000 square feet. In addition, in December 2021, New York City passed Local Law 154 of 2021, which will phase out fossil fuel usage in newly constructed residential and commercial buildings starting in 2024 for lower-rise buildings, and in 2027 for taller buildings. With few exceptions, all buildings constructed in New York City must be fully electric by 2027.

•In Washington, the State Legislature has passed a number of bills since 2019 focused on phasing out fossil fuels, achieving carbon neutrality, reducing GHG emissions, supporting the sale of zero-emissions vehicles, and establishing clean fuel standards. In support of these efforts, in 2020, Washington updated its GHG emission goals to require a reduction of 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, of 70% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-zero emissions by 2050.

•In North Carolina, State Governor Roy Cooper signed an executive order in January 2022 that updates the state’s GHG emission goals to require a reduction of 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achievement of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Alexandria has implemented a comprehensive approach to responding to transition risk through the following strategies:

Decarbonizing construction

Alexandria targets LEED Gold or Platinum certification for new ground-up developments. Through our sustainability goals for new developments, we deliver energy- and resource-efficient buildings that meet or exceed tenant, city, and state requirements for energy and water efficiency, material sourcing, biodiversity, and alternative transportation.

We are also revolutionizing the design of our buildings through innovative low-carbon solutions. At 325 Binney Street, on our Alexandria Center at One Kendall Square mega campus in Cambridge, the building design is expected to yield a 95% reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The project is targeting LEED Platinum Core & Shell and LEED Zero Energy certifications. At 685 Gateway Boulevard in South San Francisco, we are targeting Zero Energy Certification through the International Living Future Institute (ILFI) by leveraging design strategies such as building envelope optimization, high-performance features, and on-site energy generation.

With several jurisdictions shifting (or with plans to shift soon) from fossil fuels for heating and requiring all electric buildings as a strategy to reduce carbon emissions associated with building operations, we have proactively incorporated electrification into building designs, with one project completed and two currently in progress.

Embodied carbon in building materials and construction accounts for 11% of annual global GHG emissions and Alexandria is playing a leadership role in the industry’s effort to measure and ultimately reduce carbon associated with the construction process. In 2019, Alexandria became a sponsor and the first REIT to use the Carbon Leadership Forum’s Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) tool. For new construction projects, Alexandria seeks to procure products with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which provide information on product composition and environmental impact. Using such EPDs, Alexandria aims to reduce embodied carbon by 10% for new ground-up development projects. As of December 31, 2021, Alexandria has completed three embodied carbon assessments and others are in progress for 15 development projects.

105

Leveraging renewable energy

We are pursuing opportunities to power our buildings with renewable energy as another means to reduce our carbon footprint. Properties such as 3215 Merryfield Row in San Diego are generating solar energy, and our development pipeline will scale our ability to source additional clean energy on-site. We also procure renewable energy generated off-site from local utilities and from power service providers for some of our operating assets.

Reducing the environmental footprint of buildings in operation

Our sustainability mission compels us toward industry-leading sustainability practices and performance that can help reduce operating expenses and result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value, and thus enable us to capture climate-related opportunities. Our ongoing efforts to reduce consumption are driven by our commitment to operational excellence in sustainability, building efficiency, and service to our tenants. Alexandria’s 2025 sustainability goals for buildings in operation and new ground-up construction projects provide the framework, metrics, and targets that guide the Company’s focus on continuous, long-term improvement. For buildings in operation, we set goals to reduce carbon emissions, energy consumption, and potable water consumption and increase waste diversion by 2025. From 2019 to 2020, we reduced energy use by 1.7%, carbon emissions by 1.7%, and water use by 6.9% and achieved a 38.5% waste diversion rate in 2020 alone.

(1)Relative to a 2015 baseline for buildings in operation that Alexandria directly manages.
(2)For buildings in operation that Alexandria indirectly and directly manages.
(3)Reflects sum of annual like-for-like progress from 2015 to 2020.
(4)Reflects progress for all buildings in operation in 2020 that Alexandria indirectly and directly manages.

As we look to the future, we are creating our long-term strategy and plan for the net zero-carbon transition. We are developing an approach to set industry-leading science-based targets that will provide a pathway to reduce scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions and continue our leadership in sustainability.

Results of operations

We present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results and provide context for the disclosures included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We believe such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to period. We also believe this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of held for sale assets are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, and preferred stock redemption charges are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic corporate-level decisions and external market conditions. Impairments of non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate investments when their fair values decline below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions outside of our control. Significant items included in the tabular disclosure for current periods are described in further detail under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Income from rentals

Total income from rentals for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $230.0 million, or 12.2%, to $2.1 billion, compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of increases in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.

Rental revenues

Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by $146.8 million, or 10.0%, to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding a termination fee of $89.5 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, our total rental revenues increased by $236.3 million, or 17.1%, which was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties related to 2.1 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2020, and 112 operating properties aggregating 11.2 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2020.

Rental revenues from our Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $48.6 million, or 4.1%, to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2020. Refer to the “Leasing activity” section of “Item 2. Properties” within Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

For further details, refer to the “Lease accounting” section in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies.”

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $83.3 million, or 20.5%, to $489.7 million, compared to $406.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily from our Non-Same Properties related to our development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2020, as discussed under “Rental revenues” above.

Same Properties’ tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $35.3 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to higher property insurance, contract services, and utilities expenses, and an increase in property tax expenses resulting from higher assessed values of our properties during the year ended December 31, 2021, as discussed under “Rental operations” below. As of December 31, 2021, 91% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.

Other income

Other income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of construction management fees and interest income earned during each respective period.

Rental operations

Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $93.3 million, or 17.6%, to $623.6 million, compared to $530.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental expenses related to our Non-Same Properties, which consisted of development and redevelopment projects placed into service and acquired properties, as discussed under “Income from rentals” above.

Same Properties’ rental operating expenses increased by $36.4 million, or 8.7%, to $456.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $420.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of higher property insurance, contract services, and utilities expenses, and increased recoverable property tax expenses driven by higher assessed values of our properties.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $18.1 million, or 13.6%, to $151.5 million, compared to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the continued growth in the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired, as discussed under “Income from rentals” above. As a percentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 10.2% and 9.8%, respectively.

113

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $123.0 million, or 17.6%, to $821.1 million, compared to $698.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to additional depreciation from 2.1 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2020, and 112 operating properties aggregating 11.2 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2020.

114

Impairment of real estate

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized real estate asset impairments of office-related properties aggregating $52.7 million, primarily consisting of the following:

•Impairment charge of $22.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021, upon classification as held for sale of an option to purchase a land parcel in our SoMa submarket for the development of an office property, to reduce the option’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We completed the sales of the option during the three months ended December 31, 2021, at no gain or loss.
•Impairment charge of $18.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021, to reduce the carrying amount of a property located in a non-core submarket to its estimated fair value less costs to sell, upon our review of the current local market conditions.
•Impairment charges aggregating $6.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021, to further reduce the carrying amounts of three office properties located in our San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle markets to their estimated fair values less costs to sell, based on the sales price negotiated for each property during this period. We completed the sales of these properties during the three months ended September 30, 2021. These properties met the held-for-sale classification during 2020, as discussed below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized real estate asset impairments of office-related properties aggregating $48.1 million, primarily consisting of the following:

•Impairment charges aggregating $25.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2020 to reduce the carrying amounts of three office properties located in our San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle markets to their estimated fair values less costs to sell, upon classification of these properties as held for sale. As discussed above, we completed the sales of these properties during the three months ended September 30, 2021.
•Impairment charge of $6.8 million recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2020, upon classification of our real estate asset located at 945 Market Street in our SoMa submarket as held for sale. We completed the sale of this real estate asset in September 2020.
•Impairment charges aggregating $15.2 million, which mainly consisted of a $10 million write-off of the pre-acquisition deposit for a previously pending acquisition of an operating tech office property for which our revised economic projections declined from our initial underwriting. We recognized this impairment charge in April 2020 concurrently with the submission of our notice to terminate the transaction.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $67.3 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees primarily related to the refinancing of our 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $650.0 million due in 2024 pursuant to a partial cash tender offer completed on February 10, 2021, and a subsequent call for redemption for the remaining outstanding amounts completed on March 12, 2021.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we refinanced our 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2023 aggregating $500.0 million and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50.8 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees. Additionally, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million due to the termination of our $750.0 million unsecured senior line of credit.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures of $12.3 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures aggregating $8.1 million. This balance consisted of earnings from our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures of approximately $15.8 million, partially offset by an impairment charge on one of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. In March 2020, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic led to the temporary closure of a retail center owned by our 1401/1413 Research Boulevard unconsolidated real estate joint venture. We evaluated the recoverability of our investment in this joint venture and recognized a $7.6 million impairment charge to lower the carrying amount of our investment balance, which primarily consisted of real estate, to zero.

Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

115

Investment income

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized investment income aggregating $259.5 million, which consisted of $215.8 million of realized gains and $43.6 million of unrealized gains. Realized gains of $215.8 million primarily consisted of sales of investments and distributions received. Unrealized gains of $43.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisted of increases in fair values of our investments in privately held entities that report NAV.

Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures

We present components of balance sheet and operating results information for the noncontrolling interest share of our consolidated real estate joint ventures and for our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to help investors estimate balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. These amounts are estimated by computing, for each joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, the noncontrolling interest percentage of each financial item to arrive at the cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented. In addition, for our real estate joint ventures that we do not control and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Our investments into 101 West Dickman Street and 1450 Research Boulevard joint ventures were $8.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The joint ventures each have a construction loan in place which is expected to fund future redevelopment cost; therefore, we expect minimal equity contributions to be required in the future. Our partners manage the day-to-day activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of each joint venture; therefore, we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting.

•Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•Improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, and common stock;
•Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•Maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•Maintain solid credit metrics;
•Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•Prudently manage variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate debt;
•Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•Fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•Manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross real estate assets; and
•Maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

Cash flows

We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

----------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----------- ---- ------ ----------- - -----------

Net cash provided by financing activities $ 5,916,361 $ 2,750,356 $ 3,166,005

Operating activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $127.7 million to $1.0 billion, compared to $882.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since January 1, 2020, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2020.

Risk factors”; and “Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K. We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.

126

Sources of capital

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends

We expect to retain $275.0 million to $325.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending December 31, 2022. For purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. For the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed, and contributions from Same Properties and recently acquired properties to contribute significant increases in income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. We anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $39 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. Refer to the “Cash flows” section within this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Debt

We expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2022 from the real estate dispositions and partial interest sales, settlement of our outstanding forward equity sales agreements, sales of our common stock under our ATM program, issuances under our commercial paper program discussed below, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and issuances of unsecured senior notes payable.

As of December 31, 2021, we have no outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. Our unsecured senior line of credit has an aggregate commitment of $3.0 billion and bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.825% with a 0% LIBOR floor and is subject to certain annual sustainability measures entitling us to a temporary reduction in the interest rate margin of one basis point, but not below zero percent per year. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved certain sustainability measures, as described in our unsecured senior line of credit agreement, which reduced our borrowing rate to LIBOR plus 0.815% for a one-year period. In addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding.

We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate,” a “LIBOR Floating Rate,” or a “Base Rate” specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the Company for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The LIBOR Floating Rate means, for any day, one-month LIBOR, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the Company for loans denominated in U.S. dollars. The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its “prime rate,” and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%. Our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. This may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate.

We established a commercial paper program that provides us with the ability to issue up to $1.5 billion of commercial paper notes with a maturity of generally 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. Our commercial paper program is backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance on our commercial paper program. We use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. The notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. They are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance. In the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the unsecured senior line of credit at LIBOR plus 0.815%. The commercial paper notes sold during the three months ended December 31, 2021 were issued at a weighted-average yield to maturity of 0.24%. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $270.0 million of notes outstanding under our commercial paper program.

In February 2021, we opportunistically issued $1.75 billion of unsecured senior notes payable with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.49% and a weighted-average maturity of 20.4 years. The unsecured senior notes consisted of $900.0 million of 2.00% unsecured senior notes due 2032 (“2.00% Unsecured Senior Notes”) and $850.0 million of 3.00% unsecured senior notes due 2051. The proceeds from our 2.00% Unsecured Senior Notes are expected to be allocated to eligible green projects and were initially used to refinance $650.0 million of our 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2024, pursuant to a partial cash tender offer completed on February 10, 2021, and a subsequent call for redemption for the remaining outstanding amounts that settled on March 12, 2021.

Proactive management of transition away from LIBOR

LIBOR has been used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. However, based on an announcement made by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) on March 5, 2021, one-week and two-month LIBOR rates ceased to be published after December 31, 2021, and all other LIBOR settings will effectively cease after June 30, 2023, and it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used after this date. In addition, it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used in new contracts entered into after December 31, 2021. To address the impending discontinuation of LIBOR, in the U.S. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) was established to help ensure the successful transition from LIBOR. In June 2017, the ARRC selected SOFR, a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. We have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from LIBOR and have implemented numerous proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the Company, specifically:

•We have proactively eliminated outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings under our unsecured senior bank term loans and secured construction loans through repayments. From January 2017 through December 2021, we retired approximately $1.5 billion of all such debt.
•During 2020, we increased the aggregate amount of our commercial paper program to $1.5 billion from $750.0 million. This program provides us with ability to issue commercial paper notes bearing interest at short-term fixed rates, with a maturity of generally 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. Our commercial paper program is not subject to LIBOR and is used for funding short-term working capital needs. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $270.0 million of notes outstanding under our commercial paper program.
•We continue to prudently manage outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit. Additionally, new loans that we’ve entered into recently are SOFR-based rather than LIBOR-based. Our consolidated real estate joint venture at 99 Coolidge Avenue holds a SOFR-based construction loan with an outstanding balance of $8.0 million. In addition, two of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures at 1450 Research Boulevard and 101 West Dickman Street each hold a SOFR-based construction loan. As of December 31, 2021, 1450 Research Boulevard had no outstanding balance on its construction loan and 101 West Dickman Street had an outstanding balance of $9.9 million.
•Our unsecured senior line of credit contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC’s Amendment Approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement.
•We continue to monitor developments by the FCA, the ARRC, and other governing bodies involved in LIBOR transition.

Refer to Note 10 – “Secured and unsecured senior debt” and Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 and “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about our management of risks related to the transition away from LIBOR.

Real estate dispositions and partial interest sales

We expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. Future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed opportunistic acquisitions and our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects, and also provide significant capital for growth. We may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core Class A properties and/or development projects. For 2022, we expect real estate dispositions and partial interest sales ranging from $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion. The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed dispositions for an aggregate sales price $2.6 billion. Refer to the “Dispositions and sales of partial interests” section of “Investments in real estate” under Item 7 for additional information on these transactions.

As a REIT, we are generally subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the IRS characterizes as “prohibited transactions.” We do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. However, unless we meet certain “safe harbor” requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances of the sale. Our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about the “prohibited transaction” tax.

128

Common equity transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed issuances and executed forward equity sales agreements for an aggregate 20.8 million shares of common stock, including the exercise of underwriters’ option, for an aggregate net proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, as follows:

•In January 2021 and June 2021, we entered into forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million and 8.1 million of our common stock, respectively, including the exercise of underwriters’ options, at pubic offering price of $164.00 and $184.00, respectively, before underwriting discounts and commissions. During 2021, we issued all 15.0 million shares under these forward equity sales agreements and received net proceeds of $2.5 billion.

•In March 2021, we issued the remaining 362 thousand shares of common stock to settle our forward equity sales agreements that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and received net proceeds of $56.2 million.

•In February 2021, we entered into a new ATM common stock offering program, which allowed us to sell up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of our common stock.
•We issued 5.5 million shares under our ATM program and received net proceeds of $984.6 million.
•As of December 31, 2021, we have no amounts remaining under this ATM program.

•In December 2021, we entered into a new ATM common stock offering program, which allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, the full amount remains available for future sales of our common stock.

In January 2022, we entered into forward equity sales agreements to sell 8.1 million shares of our common stock (including the exercise of underwriters’ option) aggregating $1.7 billion at a public offering price of $210.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions.

Other sources

Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.

Additionally, we hold interests, together with joint venture partners, in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. These joint venture partners may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $2.0 billion of contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests.

129

Uses of capital

Summary of capital expenditures

One of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. We currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 4.8 million RSF of Class A office/laboratory, agtech, and technology office space undergoing construction, 8.7 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 14.7 million SF of future development projects in North America. We incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. We also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to the “New Class A development and redevelopment properties: current projects” and “Summary of capital expenditures” subsections of the “Investments in real estate” section under Item 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our capital expenditures.

We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $170.6 million and $125.6 million, respectively, was classified in investments in real estate.

Property taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, aggregating $69.8 million and $61.0 million, and property taxes, insurance on real estate and other operating costs aggregating $73.8 million and $52.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The increase in capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities in 2021 over 2020. Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. We are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $189.3 million. Costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.

Acquisitions

Refer to the “Acquisitions” section in Note 3 – “Investments in real estate” and to Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K, and the “Acquisitions” subsection of the “Investments in real estate” section in “Item 2. Properties” in this annual report on Form 10-K for information on our acquisitions.

Dividends

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we paid common stock dividends of $656.0 million and $533.0 million, respectively. The increase of $123.0 million in dividends paid on our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to January 1, 2020 as a result of issuances of common stock under our ATM program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $4.42 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2021 from $4.18 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2020.

130

Secured notes payable

Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2021 consisted of four notes secured by eight properties. Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 3.40%. As of December 31, 2021, the total book value of our investments in real estate securing debt was approximately $936.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, comprised approximately $195.2 million and $10.0 million of fixed-rate debt and unhedged variable-debt, respectively.

Unsecured senior notes payable and unsecured senior line of credit

The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior notes payable as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:

------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------- -----------------
Covenant Ratios(1) Requirement December 31, 2021
Total Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 60% 28%
Secured Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 40% 1%
Consolidated EBITDA(2) to Interest Expense Greater than or equal to 1.5x 11.4x
Unencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt Greater than or equal to 150% 343%

(1)All covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the respective debt agreements.
(2)The calculation of consolidated EBITDA is based on the definitions contained in our loan agreements and is not directly comparable to the computation of EBITDA as described in Exchange Act Release No. 47226.

In addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the Company’s subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.

The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line of credit as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:

--------------------------------- ------------------------------ -----------------
Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement December 31, 2021
Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 26.7%
Secured Debt Ratio Less than or equal to 45.0% 0.6%
Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 4.51x
Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.75x 9.16x

(1)All covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the credit agreement.

Estimated interest payments

Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2021, 97% of our debt was fixed-rate debt. For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and unsecured senior debt” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Ground lease obligations

Operating lease agreements

Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2021, included leases for 39 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 9% of our total number of properties. Excluding one ground lease that expires in 2036 related to one operating property with a net book value of $6.9 million as of December 31, 2021, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 32 to 93 years, including available extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.

131

As of December 31, 2021, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the lessee aggregated $927.9 million and $25.4 million, respectively. We are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under operating lease arrangements in which we are the lessee. The operating lease liability is measured based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. The right-of-use asset is equal to the corresponding operating lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, the present value of the remaining contractual payments, aggregating $953.3 million, under our operating lease agreements, including our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was $434.7 million, which was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately 42 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 4.57%. Our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated $474.3 million. We classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the “Lease accounting” section in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Commitments

As of December 31, 2021, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $2.8 billion. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $106.8 million primarily related to deposits for acquisitions in our Greater Boston and San Francisco Bay Area markets, including one $77.5 million letter of credit we issued during the three months ended June 30, 2021. The $77.5 million letter of credit served to secure our performance under the purchase and sale agreement of our acquisition of One Rogers Street in our Cambridge/Inner Suburbs submarket for a purchase price of $849.4 million. We completed this acquisition in December 2021 and terminated the letter of credit in January 2022.

We are committed to funding approximately $391.0 million related to our non-real estate investments. These funding commitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report NAV, which expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a weighted-average expiration of 9.0 years as of December 31, 2021.

Exposure to environmental liabilities

In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

Foreign currency translation gains and losses

Issuer and guarantor subsidiary summarized financial information

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the “Issuer”) has sold certain debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P. (the “LP” or the “Guarantor Subsidiary”), an indirectly 100% owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer’s other subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the subsidiaries that own substantially all of its real estate (collectively, the “Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”), will not provide a guarantee of such securities, including the subsidiaries that are partially or 100% owned by the LP.

Critical accounting estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

We continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.

Our critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.

Recognition of real estate acquired

Generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values.

We assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on:

(i)Available comparable market information,
(ii)Estimated replacement costs, or
(iii)Discounted cash flow analysis/estimated net operating income and capitalization rates.

In certain instances, we may use multiple valuation techniques and estimate fair value based on an average of multiple valuation results. We exercise judgement to determine key assumptions used in each valuation technique. For example, to estimate future cash flows in the discounted cash flow analysis, we are required to use judgment and make a number of assumptions, including those related to projected growth in rental rates and operating expenses, and anticipated trends and market/economic conditions. The use of different assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis can affect the amount of consideration allocated to the acquired depreciable/amortizable asset, which in turn can impact our net income due to the recognition of the related depreciation/amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

We completed acquisitions of 87 properties for a total purchase price of $5.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed. Refer to the “Investments in real estate” section of Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Impairment of long-lived assets

Impairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale

A property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. These criteria are described in the “Investments in real estate” section of Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. The determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. We develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. If this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. We review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. Subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset’s fair value less cost to sell. Conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.

134

Impairment of other long-lived assets

For each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.

Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. We may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.

The evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.

Impairment of real estate joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting

We generally account for our investments in real estate joint ventures that do not meet the consolidation criteria under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we initially recognize our investment at cost and subsequently adjust the carrying amount of the investment for our share of the investee’s earnings or losses, distributions received, and other-than-temporary impairments.

Our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the decrease in the carrying amount of our investment has occurred and is other than temporary. Triggering events or impairment indicators for an unconsolidated joint venture include its recurring operating losses, and other events such as occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, significant changes in construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other factors related to the properties owned by the real estate joint venture, or a decision by investors to cease providing support or reduce their financial commitment to the joint venture.

Upon determination that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount of investment to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures aggregated $38.5 million, or approximately 0.1% of our total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no other-than-temporary impairments related to our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures were identified. Refer to the “Unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” section within Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for the information regarding the impairment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the retail shopping center located in our Rockville submarket of Maryland owned by our 1401/1413 Research Boulevard unconsolidated real estate joint venture.

Impairment of non-real estate investments

We hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, agtech, and technology industries. As a REIT, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.

Our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share require our evaluation for impairment when changes in these entities’ conditions may indicate that an impairment exists. We closely monitor these investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. We evaluate these investees on the basis of a qualitative assessment for

135

indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, or (iv) significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value. As of each December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share accounted for approximately 2% of our total assets and aggregated $491.3 million, $389.2 million, and $388.1 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized impairment charges aggregating 0%, 6%, and 4% of the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV, respectively.

Monitoring of tenant credit quality

We monitor, on an ongoing basis, the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses and industries in which they conduct business, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.

We have a team of employees who, among them, have an extensive educational background or experience in biology, chemistry, industrial biotechnology, agtech, and the life science industry, as well as knowledge in finance. This team is responsible for timely assessment, monitoring, and communication of our tenants’ credit quality and any material changes therein. During the fiscal years ended 2021, 2020, and 2019, specific write-offs and a general allowance related to deferred rent balances of tenants recognized in our consolidated statements of operations have not exceeded 0.3% of our income from rentals for each respective year. Our general allowance was $6.8 million as of December 31, 2021.

Allowance for credit losses

For the financial assets in scope of the accounting standard on credit losses, we are required to estimate and recognize lifetime expected losses, rather than incurred losses, which results in the earlier recognition of credit losses even if the expected risk of credit loss is remote.

As of December 31, 2021, all of our 414 properties were subject to the operating lease agreements, which are excluded from the scope of the standard on credit losses. As of December 31, 2021, we had one direct financing lease agreement for a parking structure and two sales-type ground leases subject to this standard, with an aggregate net investment balance of $70.7 million, which represented approximately 0.2% of our total assets. At each reporting date, we estimate the current credit loss related to these assets by assessing the probability of default on these leases based on the lessees’ financial condition, credit rating, business prospects, remaining lease term, and, in the case of the direct financing lease, the expected value of the underlying collateral upon its repossession, and, if necessary, we recognize a credit loss adjustment. Since the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2020, and as of each December 31, 2021 and 2020, our allowance for credit losses has not exceeded $2.8 million, or 0.01% of our total assets. For further details, refer to refer to the “Allowance for credit losses” section in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” and to Note 5 – “Leases” to our consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP measures and definitions

This section contains additional information of certain non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders

GAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Nareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.

The 2018 White Paper published by the Nareit Board of Governors (the “Nareit White Paper”) defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.

We compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White Paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignation of an executive officer, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. Neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

The following table reconciles net income to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains or losses and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of total revenues.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.

In addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.

In order to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA margin, we divide Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. We believe this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional useful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities.

141

Annual rental revenue

Annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with GAAP, for leases in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating RSF. Annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Annual rental revenue per RSF is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of the RSF of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 91% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.

Capitalization rates

Capitalization rates are calculated based upon net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or near term prospective net operating income.

Cash interest

Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). Refer to the definition of “Fixed-charge coverage ratio” in this section under this Item 7 in this annual report on 10-K for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest.

Class A properties and AAA locations

Class A properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Class A properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.

AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.

Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction

A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new Class A properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.

Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, agtech, or tech office space. We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A office/laboratory, agtech, and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A properties.

Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.

Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) certain tenant improvements and renovations that will be reimbursed, (ii) amounts to bring certain acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of acquisition), and (iii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready office/laboratory space to foster the growth of promising early- and growth-stage life science companies.

142

Revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from Class B to Class A.

Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.

Fixed-charge coverage ratio

Fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges. We believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).

The following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest and fixed charges for the three months and years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):

Initial stabilized yield (unlevered)

Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.

Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants

Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, as reported by Bloomberg Professional Services. Credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings reflect credit ratings of the tenant’s parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant’s parent entity will satisfy the tenant’s lease obligation upon such tenant’s default. We monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. Material changes that cause a tenant’s market capitalization to decrease below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

Joint venture financial information

We present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with GAAP. We present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.

The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.

We believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.

The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, or results of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Mega campus

Mega campuses are cluster campuses that consist of approximately 1 million or more RSF, including operating, active development/redevelopment, and land RSF less operating RSF expected to be demolished. The following table reconciles our operating RSF as of December 31, 2021:

--------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- -

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. For purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.

Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA

Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. Refer to the definition of “Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin” under Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. We believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.

Furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. Net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. We also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. Therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.

We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.

Operating statistics

We present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of “Annual rental revenue” in this “Non-GAAP measures and definitions” section.

147

Same property comparisons

As a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. Additionally, termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. Refer to the “Same properties” subsection in the “Results of operations” section within this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Stabilized occupancy date

The stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises.

We classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenue in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in the “Comparison of results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020” subsection of the “Results of operations” section within this Item 7 because we believe it promotes investors’ understanding of our operating results. We believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.

The following table reconciles income from rentals to tenant recoveries for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):

------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- ----------- ---- --------- ----------- - ---------
 Year Ended December 31,
 2021 2020 2019
Income from rentals $ 2,108,249 $ 1,878,208 $ 1,516,864
Rental revenues (1,618,592) (1,471,840) (1,165,788)
Tenant recoveries $ 489,657 $ 406,368 $ 351,076

Total market capitalization

Total market capitalization is equal to the outstanding shares of common stock at the end of the period multiplied by the closing price on the last trading day of the period (i.e., total equity capitalization), plus total debt outstanding at period-end.

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

148

The following table summarizes unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- ------ ---- --------- ------ - ---------
 Year Ended December 31,
 2021 2020 2019
Unencumbered net operating income $ 1,444,307 $ 1,295,520 $ 1,024,619
Encumbered net operating income 46,288 59,893 61,185
Total net operating income $ 1,490,595 $ 1,355,413 $ 1,085,804
Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income 97% 96% 94%

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted

From time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements (“Forward Agreements”), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. We are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, we had no Forward Agreements outstanding. Refer to Note 15 – “Stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

The weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating EPS – diluted, funds from operations per share – diluted, and funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, are calculated as follows (in thousands):

Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020.

We began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 ...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. 80 ADOBE INC.
