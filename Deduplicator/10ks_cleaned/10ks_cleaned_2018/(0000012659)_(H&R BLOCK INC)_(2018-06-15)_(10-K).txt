ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
A summary of our fiscal year 2018 results is as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Tax returns prepared worldwide increased 1.5%, and returns prepared in the U.S. increased 2.5%. Our paid U.S. DIY returns increased by 7.8%, while our U.S. assisted returns declined 0.6% compared to the prior year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Revenues increased $123.6 million, or 4.1%, compared to the prior year. Revenues were impacted by a 0.7% increase in U.S. assisted tax returns prepared in company-owned offices and a 7.8% increase in paid U.S. DIY returns, coupled with favorable pricing and mix changes on our assisted tax returns and RTs, our international operations and POM.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Operating expenses increased $87.6 million, or 3.8%, due to a combination of higher compensation costs, higher rent and bad debt expenses, partially offset by lower marketing spend.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Pretax earnings increased $39.4 million, or 6.3%, due primarily to the revenue changes mentioned above.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Income tax expense decreased $166.5 million, or 79.9%, due to Tax Legislation enacted during the fiscal year.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Net income from continuing operations increased $206.0 million or 48.9% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower income taxes. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 52.0% from the prior year to $2.98 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and higher net income.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased $37.0 million, or 4.1%, to $941.4 million. See "Non-GAAP Financial Information" at the end of this item for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

(1) An assisted tax return is defined as a current or prior year individual tax return that has been accepted and paid for by the client. Also included are business returns. The count methodology has been adjusted in the current and prior years periods to exclude business extensions and to recognize the corresponding tax returns when filed. A DIY return is defined as a return that has been electronically filed and accepted by the IRS. Also included are online returns paid and printed.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the end of the Canadian tax season was extended from April 30 into May. Tax returns prepared in Canada in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 includes approximately 59 thousand and 93 thousand returns, respectively, in both company-owned and franchise offices which were accepted by the client after April 30. The revenues related to these returns were recognized in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Net average charge is calculated as tax preparation fees divided by tax returns prepared. For DIY, net average charge excludes IRS Free File.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Net average charge related to H&R Block Franchise Operations represents tax preparation fees collected by H&R Block franchisees divided by returns prepared in franchise offices. H&R Block will recognize a portion of franchise revenues as franchise royalties based on the terms of franchise agreements.

We provide Net Average Charge as a key operating metric because we consider it an important supplemental measure useful to analysts, investors, and other interested parties as it provides insights into pricing and tax return mix relative to our customer base, which are significant drivers of revenue. Our definition of Net Average Charge may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017
Revenues increased $123.6 million, or 4.1%, compared to the prior year.
U.S. assisted tax preparation fees increased $44.9 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to an increase of 0.7% in tax returns prepared in company-owned offices, coupled with a more favorable pricing and mix. Franchise returns were down 3.4% primarily due to our acquisition of franchise businesses during the year, which resulted in a decline of $4.8 million, or 1.9%, in U.S royalties.
U.S. DIY tax preparation fees increased $24.0 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a 7.8% increase in paid returns and a higher net average charge, which is due to favorable product mix.
International revenues increased $16.9 million, or 8.1%, primarily due to favorable results and exchange rates in our Australian and Canadian operations.
Fees earned on RTs increased $23.7 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to a price increase on RTs in our assisted business.
Total operating expenses increased $87.6 million, or 3.8%, from the prior year. Field wages increased $38.2 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to higher wages due to higher return volumes and higher office labor in our Australian and Canadian operations. Other wages increased $10.2 million, or 5.6%, due to increased headcount primarily related to information technology resources and inflationary increases in corporate support wages. Occupancy expenses increased $24.1 million, or 6.4%, primarily due to higher rent rates, an increase in the number of company-owned offices and the write-off of leasehold improvements in approximately 400 offices that we decided to permanently close after this year's tax season. Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $12.1 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to lower television and radio advertising, offset by higher online marketing costs. Bad debt expense increased $21.7 million, or 41.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt rates on RT fees and tax preparation fees, and more recoveries in the prior year.
Other expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 0.7%. The components of other expenses are as follows:

------------------------------------ ------ ------- ---- ------ -------- ------- -------- - - ------ -- ---- --

Other 36,519 39,257 (2,738 ) (7.0 )%
 $ 362,528 $ 365,217 $ (2,689 ) (0.7 )%

Pretax income for fiscal year 2018 increased $39.4 million, or 6.3%, and pretax margin (pretax income divided by revenues) increased to 21.2% from 20.7% in fiscal year 2017. Net income from continuing operations increased $206.0 million, or 48.9%, over the prior year. Income taxes decreased $166.5 million from the prior year. The decline is due to our effective tax rate decreasing to 6.3% compared to 33.1% in the prior year. The reduced effective tax rate resulted primarily from the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the rate decrease is exaggerated in fiscal year 2018 due to the seasonality of our business and our differing year ends for corporate income tax filing and financial reporting purposes. See Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 52.0% from the prior year to $2.98 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and higher net income.
Losses of our discontinued mortgage operations resulted primarily from litigation expenses. See the discussion of the risk of contingent losses related to our discontinued operations in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and in Item 8, notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 0.1%, compared to fiscal year 2016.
U.S. assisted tax preparation fees increased $12.0 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to a more favorable net average charge and mix, offset by a decline in tax returns prepared in company-owned offices. Although franchise returns were down 5.7% primarily due to our acquisition of franchise businesses during the year, royalties related to our RA offering offset the lower volumes.

Table of Contents

U.S. DIY tax preparation fees declined $15.2 million, or 6.5%, due to our H&R Block More Zero® promotion, which offered free online tax preparation for certain forms. This decrease was partially offset by a 3.5% increase in returns.
Fees earned on RTs decreased $14.3 million, or 8.8%, primarily due to lower attach rates due to our H&R Block More Zero® and Free 1040EZ promotions and the offering of state RTs at no cost.
Revenue from POM increased $6.0 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to an increase in units sold in prior years and favorable changes in the timing of forecasted claims.
Other revenues increased $9.6 million, or 18.6%, primarily due to the fees earned on our TIS product, partially offset by a decline in income on our mortgage loan portfolio and investments in available-for-sale (AFS) securities recorded as other income in fiscal year 2017 rather than as revenue for a portion of fiscal year 2016.
Total operating expenses decreased $84.6 million, or 3.5%, from fiscal year 2016. Total compensation and benefits decreased $26.4 million primarily due to lower headcount in our field and corporate operations and lower wages due to lower return volumes. These declines were partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation. Occupancy expenses increased $8.8 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher rental rates on tax offices. Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $36.5 million, or 12.3%, primarily due to our fiscal year 2016 sweepstakes campaign. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.6 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to amortization resulting from acquisitions of franchisee and competitor businesses. Bad debt expense decreased $22.6 million, or 30.0%, primarily due to favorable collections on prior year EAs and RTs, and a reduction in overall bad debt rate on fiscal year 2017 balances.
Other expenses decreased $14.0 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to fiscal year 2016 costs associated with capital transactions and the divestiture of HRB Bank and cost savings initiatives. These were partially offset by higher fees paid to our bank partners in fiscal year 2017 for products and services they offer to our clients, including program costs related to our RA offering introduced in fiscal year 2017. The components of other expenses are as follows:

Interest expense increased $24.0 million, or 34.8%, due primarily to issuance of our Senior Notes during fiscal year 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.
Pretax income for fiscal year 2017 increased $59.8 million, or 10.5%, while our pretax margin increased to 20.7% from 18.7% in fiscal year 2016. Net income from continuing operations increased $37.4 million, or 9.7%, over fiscal year 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 28.1% from fiscal year 2016 to $1.96 due to a 14.6% decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding and higher net income.
Losses of our discontinued mortgage operations resulted primarily from litigation expenses. See the discussion of the risk of contingent losses related to our discontinued operations in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and in Item 8, notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific methods and assumptions for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our

-- --------------------------------

26 2018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.

Table of Contents

Board of Directors. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment.
See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future.
LITIGATION AND OTHER RELATED CONTINGENCIES –
Nature of Estimates Required. We accrue liabilities related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing the likely outcome of pending or threatened litigation, indemnification and contribution claims, and other related loss contingencies, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective.
Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to pending or threatened litigation claims and claims for indemnification and contribution, and other related loss contingencies, which are described in Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required to be accrued, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience. In cases where we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not reasonably estimable, no liability is accrued.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change. It is reasonably possible that future litigation and other related loss contingencies may vary from the amounts accrued. Our aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but a liability has not been accrued. This aggregate range represents only those losses as to which we are currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss. It does not represent our maximum loss exposure. As of April 30, 2018, we believe the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued is not material.
However, our judgments on whether a loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting changes in, or interpretations of, laws, predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions, and numerous other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly differ from our current estimates.
INCOME TAXES – UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS –
Nature of Estimates Required. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted Tax Legislation, which makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our financial statements. As of April 30, 2018, our financial statements reflect reasonable provisional estimates of the effects of Tax Legislation in computing our uncertain tax positions. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including interest or penalties. We accrue a liability for unrecognized tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions reflecting our judgment as to the ultimate resolution of the applicable issues.
Assumptions and Approach Used. Differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the amount of benefit recorded in our financial statements result in unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the balance sheet as either a liability or reductions to recorded tax assets, as applicable. Our uncertain tax positions arise from items such as apportionment of income for state purposes, transfer pricing, and the deductibility of related party transactions. We evaluate each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. For each position, we consider all applicable information including relevant tax laws, the taxing authorities potential position, our tax return position, and the possible settlement outcomes to determine the amount of liability to record. In making this determination, we assume the tax authority has all relevant information at its disposal.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change. Our assessment of the technical merits and measurement of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions is subject to a high degree of judgment and estimation. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
See the additional discussion in Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY –
OVERVIEW – Our primary sources of capital and liquidity include cash from operations (including changes in working capital), draws on our 2017 CLOC, and issuances of debt. We use our sources of liquidity primarily to fund working capital, service and repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and acquire businesses.
Our operations are highly seasonal and substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are generated during the period from February through April. Therefore, we require the use of cash to fund losses and working capital needs from May through January, and typically rely on available cash balances from the prior tax season and borrowings to meet our off-season liquidity needs.
Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, we believe that, in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital as of April 30, 2018 are sufficient to meet our future operating and financing needs.
DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS – The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Item 8 for the complete consolidated statements of cash flows for these periods.

---------------------------------------- -------- ------- -------- --------- ------- ---------- - - ---------- -

 (in 000s)
Year ended April 30, 2018 2017 2016
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 850,003 $ 552,197 $ 544,553
Investing activities (112,057 ) 99,319 329,515
Financing activities (190,664 ) (530,424 ) (1,961,729 )
Effects of exchange rate changes on cash (1,143 ) (4,464 ) (10,590 )
Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 546,139 $ 116,628 $ (1,098,251 )

Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $297.8 million from fiscal year 2017. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher net income, lower taxes paid, and prior year settlement payments related to representation and warranty claims.
Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $112.1 million compared to cash provided of $99.3 million in the prior year. This change is principally due to the sale of our portfolio of mortgage loans in the prior year.
Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities decreased $339.8 million. This decrease resulted primarily from lower share repurchase activity in the current year.

CASH REQUIREMENTS –
Dividends and Share Repurchase. Returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of outstanding shares has historically been a significant component of our capital allocation plan.
We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $200.5 million, $187.1 million and $201.7 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although we have historically paid dividends and plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends.
Capital Investment. Capital expenditures totaled $98.6 million and $89.3 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we expended net cash totaling $42.5 million and $54.8 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, to acquire franchisee and competitor businesses. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to recurring improvements to retail offices, as well as investments in computers, software and related assets; however, we are conducting an ongoing comprehensive strategy review. Implementing the strategic and operating objectives resulting from such review will require capital investments.
FINANCING RESOURCES – On September 22, 2017, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2017 CLOC), which further amended our First Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2016 CLOC). Our 2017 CLOC has capacity up to $2.0 billion, and is scheduled to expire in September 2022. Other material terms remain unchanged from our 2016 CLOC.
Proceeds under the 2017 CLOC may be used for working capital needs or for other general corporate purposes. We were in compliance with our 2017 CLOC covenants as of April 30, 2018. As of April 30, 2018, amounts available to borrow under the 2017 CLOC were limited by the debt-to-EBITDA covenant to approximately $1.7 billion; however, our cash needs at April 30 generally do not require us to borrow on our CLOC at that time and we had no balance outstanding as of April 30, 2018. See Item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Senior Notes and our 2017 CLOC.
The following table provides ratings for debt issued by Block Financial as of April 30, 2018 and 2017:

----------- -------------- -------------- ------- ---------- --------- --------

As of April 30, 2018 April 30, 2017
 Short-term Long-term Outlook Short-term Long-term Outlook
Moody's (1) P-3 Baa3 Stable P-3 Baa3 Stable
S&P A-2 BBB Stable A-2 BBB Negative

(1)    Outlook of Negative effective June 13, 2018.
CASH AND OTHER ASSETS – As of April 30, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted amounts, of $1.5 billion, including $111.1 million held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Foreign Operations. Seasonal borrowing needs of our Canadian operations are typically funded by our U.S. operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange forward contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2018.
We do not currently intend to repatriate non-borrowed funds held by our foreign subsidiaries.
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates during the period on our international cash balances resulted in a decrease of $1.1 million during fiscal year 2018 compared to decreases of $4.5 million and $10.6 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,699,772 $ 314,875 $ 1,195,109 $ 752,612 $ 437,176

The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $186 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these amounts.
In connection with our agreement with BofI, we are required to purchase a 90% participation interest, at par, in all EAs originated by our lending partner.
During fiscal year 2018, we decided to permanently close approximately 400 tax offices after this year's tax season and, as a result, wrote off $7.4 million in related leasehold improvements, furniture and signage. In conjunction with these office closures, we expect to incur $15 million to $20 million of expense in fiscal year 2019 as we exit the related operating leases.
See discussion of contractual obligations and commitments in Item 8, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT – The federal government, various state, local, provincial and foreign governments, and some self-regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the offering of RTs, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods and banking. We determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and work to comply with those Laws that are applicable to us or our services or products.
On November 17, 2017, the CFPB officially published the Payday Rule. Certain limited provisions of the Payday Rule became effective on January 16, 2018, but most provisions do not become effective until August 19, 2019. However, on January 16, 2018, the CFPB stated its intention to engage in a rulemaking process so that the CFPB may reconsider the Payday Rule, and industry groups have filed lawsuits challenging the rule. Given these developments, we are unsure whether, and in what form, the Payday Rule will go into effect. Depending on the outcome of the rulemaking process and litigation, which may include the Payday Rule becoming effective in its current form, the Payday Rule may have a material adverse impact on the EA product, our business, and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We will continue to analyze the potential impact on the Company as the CFPB’s rulemaking process progresses.
On October 5, 2016, the CFPB released the Prepaid Card Rule. The Prepaid Card Rule was scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2018, with certain provisions phased in over time following that date. However, on January 25, 2018, the CFPB amended the Prepaid Card Rule and extended the general effective date until April 1, 2019. Once effective, the Prepaid Card Rule will apply to the Emerald Card. The Prepaid Card Rule, among other things: (i) requires consumer disclosures to be made prior to acquiring a prepaid account; (ii) requires periodic statements or online access to specified account information; and (iii) requires online posting of the Cardholder Agreement and submission of new and revised Cardholder Agreements to the CFPB. We do not expect that the Prepaid Card Rule will have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have

-- --------------------------------

Table of Contents

demonstrated that we comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulatory inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Tax Legislation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted Tax Legislation, which makes broad and complex changes to both the corporate income tax provisions and individual income tax provisions of the U.S. tax code generally effective beginning in calendar year 2018. For a discussion of the impact of the corporate tax law changes included in the Tax Legislation on our consolidated financial statements, see Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
The changes to the individual income tax provisions include a reduction of the individual federal tax rate brackets for most income levels, the elimination of personal exemptions, an increase in the standard deduction, and placing a cap on the aggregate amount of property, sales, and state and local income tax deductions at $10,000.  These changes did not impact our April 30, 2018 financial statements, but we believe they will cause a decrease in the number of filers who itemize deductions beginning in fiscal year 2019.  We recently announced an intent to review our overall pricing structure, which we expect will address the impact of the recent Tax Legislation and negatively impact revenues in fiscal year 2019.  See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further information on Tax Legislation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because these measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies.
We consider our non-GAAP financial measures to be performance measures and a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business .
We may consider whether significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We measure the performance of our business using a variety of metrics, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations, EBITDA margin from continuing operations and free cash flow. We also use EBITDA from continuing operations and pretax income of continuing operations, each subject to permitted adjustments, as performance metrics in incentive compensation calculations for our employees.
The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA from continuing operations to net income:

------------------------------------------------------ ------- ------- ------- --------- ------- ------- - - -------

['s tax season. Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $12.1 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to lower television and radio advertising, offset by higher online marketing costs. Bad debt expense increased $21.7 million, or 41.1%, primarily due to higher bad debt rates on RT fees and tax preparation fees, and more recoveries in the prior year.
Other expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 0.7%. The components of other expenses are as follows:

Pretax income for fiscal year 2018 increased $39.4 million, or 6.3%, and pretax margin (pretax income divided by revenues) increased to 21.2% from 20.7% in fiscal year 2017. Net income from continuing operations increased $206.0 million, or 48.9%, over the prior year. Income taxes decreased $166.5 million from the prior year. The decline is due to our effective tax rate decreasing to 6.3% compared to 33.1% in the prior year. The reduced effective tax rate resulted primarily from the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the rate decrease is exaggerated in fiscal year 2018 due to the seasonality of our business and our differing year ends for corporate income tax filing and financial reporting purposes. See Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 52.0% from the prior year to $2.98 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and higher net income.
Losses of our discontinued mortgage operations resulted primarily from litigation expenses. See the discussion of the risk of contingent losses related to our discontinued operations in Item 1A, "]:
NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

FISCAL 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2016
Revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 0.1%, compared to fiscal year 2016.
U.S. assisted tax preparation fees increased $12.0 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to a more favorable net average charge and mix, offset by a decline in tax returns prepared in company-owned offices. Although franchise returns were down 5.7% primarily due to our acquisition of franchise businesses during the year, royalties related to our RA offering offset the lower volumes.

U.S. DIY tax preparation fees declined $15.2 million, or 6.5%, due to our H&R Block More Zero® promotion, which offered free online tax preparation for certain forms. This decrease was partially offset by a 3.5% increase in returns.
Fees earned on RTs decreased $14.3 million, or 8.8%, primarily due to lower attach rates due to our H&R Block More Zero® and Free 1040EZ promotions and the offering of state RTs at no cost.
Revenue from POM increased $6.0 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to an increase in units sold in prior years and favorable changes in the timing of forecasted claims.
Other revenues increased $9.6 million, or 18.6%, primarily due to the fees earned on our TIS product, partially offset by a decline in income on our mortgage loan portfolio and investments in available-for-sale (AFS) securities recorded as other income in fiscal year 2017 rather than as revenue for a portion of fiscal year 2016.
Total operating expenses decreased $84.6 million, or 3.5%, from fiscal year 2016. Total compensation and benefits decreased $26.4 million primarily due to lower headcount in our field and corporate operations and lower wages due to lower return volumes. These declines were partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation. Occupancy expenses increased $8.8 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher rental rates on tax offices. Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $36.5 million, or 12.3%, primarily due to our fiscal year 2016 sweepstakes campaign. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.6 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to amortization resulting from acquisitions of franchisee and competitor businesses. Bad debt expense decreased $22.6 million, or 30.0%, primarily due to favorable collections on prior year EAs and RTs, and a reduction in overall bad debt rate on fiscal year 2017 balances.
Other expenses decreased $14.0 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to fiscal year 2016 costs associated with capital transactions and the divestiture of HRB Bank and cost savings initiatives. These were partially offset by higher fees paid to our bank partners in fiscal year 2017 for products and services they offer to our clients, including program costs related to our RA offering introduced in fiscal year 2017. The components of other expenses are as follows:

Interest expense increased $24.0 million, or 34.8%, due primarily to issuance of our Senior Notes during fiscal year 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.
Pretax income for fiscal year 2017 increased $59.8 million, or 10.5%, while our pretax margin increased to 20.7% from 18.7% in fiscal year 2016. Net income from continuing operations increased $37.4 million, or 9.7%, over fiscal year 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 28.1% from fiscal year 2016 to $1.96 due to a 14.6% decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding and higher net income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific methods and assumptions for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our

-- --------------------------------

26 2018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.

Table of Contents

Board of Directors. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment.
See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future.
LITIGATION AND OTHER RELATED CONTINGENCIES –
Nature of Estimates Required. We accrue liabilities related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing the likely outcome of pending or threatened litigation, indemnification and contribution claims, and other related loss contingencies, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective.
Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to pending or threatened litigation claims and claims for indemnification and contribution, and other related loss contingencies, which are described in Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required to be accrued, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience. In cases where we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not reasonably estimable, no liability is accrued.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change. It is reasonably possible that future litigation and other related loss contingencies may vary from the amounts accrued. Our aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but a liability has not been accrued. This aggregate range represents only those losses as to which we are currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss. It does not represent our maximum loss exposure. As of April 30, 2018, we believe the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued is not material.
However, our judgments on whether a loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting changes in, or interpretations of, laws, predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions, and numerous other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly differ from our current estimates.
INCOME TAXES – UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS –
Nature of Estimates Required. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted Tax Legislation, which makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our financial statements. As of April 30, 2018, our financial statements reflect reasonable provisional estimates of the effects of Tax Legislation in computing our uncertain tax positions. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including interest or penalties. We accrue a liability for unrecognized tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions reflecting our judgment as to the ultimate resolution of the applicable issues.
 tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the balance sheet as either a liability or reductions to recorded tax assets, as applicable. Our uncertain tax positions arise from items such as apportionment of income for state purposes, transfer pricing, and the deductibility of related party transactions. We evaluate each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. For each position, we consider all applicable information including relevant tax laws, the taxing authorities potential position, our tax return position, and the possible settlement outcomes to determine the amount of liability to record. In making this determination, we assume the tax authority has all relevant information at its disposal.

Table of Contents

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change. Our assessment of the technical merits and measurement of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions is subject to a high degree of judgment and estimation. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
See the additional discussion in Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY –
OVERVIEW – Our primary sources of capital and liquidity include cash from operations (including changes in working capital), draws on our 2017 CLOC, and issuances of debt. We use our sources of liquidity primarily to fund working capital, service and repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and acquire businesses.
Our operations are highly seasonal and substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are generated during the period from February through April. Therefore, we require the use of cash to fund losses and working capital needs from May through January, and typically rely on available cash balances from the prior tax season and borrowings to meet our off-season liquidity needs.
Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, we believe that, in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital as of April 30, 2018 are sufficient to meet our future operating and financing needs.
DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS – The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Item 8 for the complete consolidated statements of cash flows for these periods.

---------------------------------------- -------- ------- -------- --------- ------- ---------- - - ---------- -

 (in 000s)
Year ended April 30, 2018 2017 2016
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 850,003 $ 552,197 $ 544,553
Investing activities (112,057 ) 99,319 329,515
Financing activities (190,664 ) (530,424 ) (1,961,729 )
Effects of exchange rate changes on cash (1,143 ) (4,464 ) (10,590 )
Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 546,139 $ 116,628 $ (1,098,251 )

Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $297.8 million from fiscal year 2017. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher net income, lower taxes paid, and prior year settlement payments related to representation and warranty claims.
Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $112.1 million compared to cash provided of $99.3 million in the prior year. This change is principally due to the sale of our portfolio of mortgage loans in the prior year.
Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities decreased $339.8 million. This decrease resulted primarily from lower share repurchase activity in the current year.

CASH REQUIREMENTS –
Dividends and Share Repurchase. Returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of outstanding shares has historically been a significant component of our capital allocation plan.
We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $200.5 million, $187.1 million and $201.7 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although we have historically paid dividends and plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends.
Capital Investment. Capital expenditures totaled $98.6 million and $89.3 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we expended net cash totaling $42.5 million and $54.8 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, to acquire franchisee and competitor businesses. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to recurring improvements to retail offices, as well as investments in computers, software and related assets; however, we are conducting an ongoing comprehensive strategy review. Implementing the strategic and operating objectives resulting from such review will require capital investments.
FINANCING RESOURCES – On September 22, 2017, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2017 CLOC), which further amended our First Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2016 CLOC). Our 2017 CLOC has capacity up to $2.0 billion, and is scheduled to expire in September 2022. Other material terms remain unchanged from our 2016 CLOC.
Proceeds under the 2017 CLOC may be used for working capital needs or for other general corporate purposes. We were in compliance with our 2017 CLOC covenants as of April 30, 2018. As of April 30, 2018, amounts available to borrow under the 2017 CLOC were as of April 30, 2018. See Item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Senior Notes and our 2017 CLOC.
