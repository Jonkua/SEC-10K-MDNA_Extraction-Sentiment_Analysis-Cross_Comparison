ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

Celgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively “we,” “our,” “us,” “Celgene” or the “Company”), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.

Our primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, VIDAZA®, azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA®), THALOMID® (sold as THALOMID® or Thalidomide Celgene® outside of the U.S.) and IDHIFA®. IDHIFA® was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or (R/R AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation as detected by an FDA approved diagnostic test. We began recognizing revenue related to IDHIFA® during the third quarter of 2017. In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.

We continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID® is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma and lymphomas. Also, within hematological malignancies, POMALYST® is in several phase III and post-approval trials for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE® is currently in various stages of investigation for pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA® is being evaluated in phase III trials for Behçet's disease and scalp psoriasis, and is continuing to be studied in ulcerative colitis (UC), psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), UC and a phase III trial in Crohn's Disease (CD) that is initiating. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), for CC-486 in AML and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In July 2017, Celgene Corporation entered into global strategic immuno-oncology collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) to advance a PD-1 Inhibitor (BGB-A317) program for solid tumor cancers. In collaboration with bluebird bio, bb2121, a BCMA CAR T cell therapy, has shown impressive efficacy in RRMM with a manageable safety profile. Breakthrough Therapy designation has been granted by the FDA and bb2121 has been given access to the Priority Medicines scheme by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A pivotal study in RRMM was initiated in December 2017.

Beyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.

Recent Developments

2017 Tax Act: In December 2017, the President signed U.S. tax reform legislation (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits (E&P), referred to as the toll charge;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Reduction in the Corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Introduction of a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) at an effective tax rate of 10.5% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 (increasing to 13.125% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025) with a partial offset by foreign tax credits; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Introduction of a territorial tax system beginning in 2018 by providing a 100% dividends received deduction on certain qualified dividends from foreign subsidiaries.

34

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of approximately $1,269 million, which was comprised of the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An income tax expense of approximately $1,890 million for the one-time deemed repatriation of E&P. In accordance with the 2017 Tax Act, the toll charge liability may be paid over eight years. As such, we have recorded $1,732 million and $150 million in non-current and current income tax liability on an undiscounted basis, respectively, as of December 31, 2017; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An income tax benefit of $621 million, primarily for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rate of 21%.

The net charge recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the income tax effect for certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. Our actual results may materially differ from our current estimate due to, among other things, further guidance that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities or regulatory bodies including the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to interpret the 2017 Tax Act. We will continue to analyze the 2017 Tax Act and any additional guidance that may be issued so we can finalize the full effects of applying the new legislation on our financial statements in the measurement period. See Note 16 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to the 2017 Tax Act.

Discontinuance of Certain GED-0301 Phase III Trials: On October 19, 2017, we announced our decision to discontinue the GED-0301 phase III REVOLVE (CD-002) trial in CD and the SUSTAIN (CD-004) extension trial (the Trials). At that time, we concluded we would record a significant impairment of our GED-0301 in-process research and development (IPR&D) asset, incur wind-down costs associated with discontinuing the Trials and certain development activities, and record a benefit related to the significant reduction of GED-0301 contingent consideration liabilities. At the date GED-0301 was acquired by Celgene, a phase II trial of GED-0301 in patients with active CD had been completed and a multi-year clinical program designed to support global registrations of GED-0301 in CD was planned, while other indications were not as advanced. As such, substantially all of the IPR&D asset and contingent consideration liabilities were attributed to the development and commercialization of GED-0301 for the treatment of CD. As a result of the discontinuance of the Trials, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $411 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. The net pre-tax charge was comprised of the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An impairment charge relating to the entire GED-0301 IPR&D asset of approximately $1,620 million. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the impairment of the GED-0301 IPR&D asset;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other one-time charges of approximately $188 million that will require cash payments primarily related to wind-down costs associated with discontinuing the Trials and certain development activities; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A reduction in contingent consideration liabilities of approximately $1,397 million related to GED-0301. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on contingent consideration liabilities.

The following tables present significant developments in our pivotal and phase III clinical trials and regulatory approval requests that occurred during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as well as developments that are expected to occur if the future occurrence is material and reasonably certain:

Regulatory Approval Requests in Major Markets:

---------- ---------------------------------- ------------ ----------------- -------------------

Product Disease Indication/New Formulation Major Market Regulatory Agency Action
ozanimod Relapsing multiple sclerosis U.S. FDA Q4 2017 (submitted)
OTEZLA® QD Once-daily formulation U.S. FDA Q4 2017 (submitted)

Pivotal and Phase III Trials:

----------------- ---------------------------- ------------------ ------------

Product Candidate Trial Disease Indication Action
GED-0301(1) Phase III - REVOLVE (CD-002) Crohn's disease Discontinued
GED-0301(1) Phase III - SUSTAIN (CD-004) Crohn's disease Discontinued
bb2121 Pivotal - KarMMa™ RRMM Initiated

(1) In October 2017, we announced that the GED-0301 (mongersen) phase III REVOLVE (CD-002) trial in Crohn’s disease (CD) and the SUSTAIN (CD-004) extension trial (Trials) will discontinue. We decided to stop the Trials following an October recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis. There were no meaningful safety imbalances identified in the interim futility analysis. In addition, at this time, the phase III DEFINE (CD-003) trial in CD will not be initiated. We are waiting to review the full dataset from the phase II trial with GED-0301 in UC to determine next steps.

Recent Transactions

Impact Biomedicines, Inc. (Impact): On January 7, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Impact, a privately held biotechnology company which is developing fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Under the terms of the agreement, we will make an upfront cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, Impact Biomedicines' shareholders are eligible to receive contingent regulatory approval milestones up to $1.4 billion and contingent commercial milestones up to $4.5 billion based on cumulative sales levels of between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The acquisition of Impact is not anticipated to include any significant processes and thus, for accounting purposes, we have preliminary concluded that the acquired assets will not meet the accounting definition of a business. As such, the transaction will be accounted for as a research and development asset acquisition.

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno): On January 21, 2018, we entered into a merger agreement with Juno under which we will pay $87 per share in cash, or approximately $9.0 billion net of cash and marketable securities acquired and Juno shares already owned by us (approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares), which we anticipate to be accounted for as a business combination. Juno is a publicly held biotechnology company which is developing CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a broad, novel portfolio evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. The acquisition will also add a novel scientific platform and scalable manufacturing capabilities including JCAR017, a CD19-directed CAR T currently in a program for relapsed an/or refractory diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma. The transaction has been approved by the board of directors of Celgene and Juno. We expect to complete the transaction during the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and the expiration of applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and new debt.

Financial Update

The following table summarizes net product sales, total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):

-------------------------- ------------------------ -------------- ---- -------------- ---- ------ -------- - ----- ---- - ---- -

 % Change
 Years Ended December 31, 2017versus2016 2016versus2015
 2017 2016 2015
Net product sales $ 12,973 $ 11,185 $ 9,161 16.0 % 22.1 %
Total revenue $ 13,003 $ 11,229 $ 9,256 15.8 % 21.3 %
Net income $ 2,940 $ 1,999 $ 1,602 47.1 % 24.8 %
Diluted earnings per share $ 3.64 $ 2.49 $ 1.94 46.2 % 28.4 %

Total net product sales for 2017 increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 16.0%, to approximately $13.0 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of approximately $1.5 billion, or 13.6%, and net price increases of $369 million, or 3.3%. The increase in volume was primarily driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and OTEZLA®. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S., which were partially offset by price decreases in Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity, unfavorably impacted net product sales by $98 million, or 0.9%.

36

Total net product sales for 2016 increased by approximately $2.0 billion, or 22.1%, to approximately $11.2 billion compared to 2015. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.7 billion or 18.4% and net price increases of $415 million or 4.5%, offset in part by a $71 million, or 0.8% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID®, OTEZLA®, and POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID® and ABRAXANE®. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.

Total revenue increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 15.8%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and OTEZLA® reflecting increases of approximately $1.3 billion, or 18.7%, in the United States and $460 million, or 10.9%, in international markets.

Total revenue increased by approximately $2.0 billion, or 21.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and OTEZLA® reflecting increases of approximately $1.4 billion, or 25.1%, in the United States and $567 million, or 15.5%, in international markets.

In addition to the increase in total revenue discussed above, notable items impacting net income and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

Results of Operations - Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015
Net Product Sales and Other Revenue

Net product sales and other revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

REVLIMID®

------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---------------- ---------------- ----- - ---- - ---- -

 Percent Change
 2017 2016 2015 2017 versus 2016 2016 versus 2015
U.S. $ 5,426 $ 4,417 $ 3,535 22.8 % 25.0 %

Worldwide $ 8,187 $ 6,974 $ 5,801 17.4 % 20.2 %

REVLIMID® net sales increased by approximately $1.2 billion, or 17.4%, to approximately $8.2 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased sales in both U.S. and international markets. U.S. sales growth increased due to both price increases and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit sales from market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID®. In addition, unit sales increased across all international regions, primarily in Europe and Japan, driven by increased duration of use and market share gains. International volume growth was partially offset by net price decreases.

37

REVLIMID® net sales increased by approximately $1.2 billion, or 20.2%, to approximately $7.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets and price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID® in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains. REVLIMID® launched in the U.S. and EU for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma following approval in February 2015.

POMALYST®/IMNOVID®

------------- ---- ----- ---- --- ---- ----- ---------------- ---------------- ---- - ---- - ---- -

 2017 2016 2015 2017 versus 2016 2016 versus 2015
U.S. $ 1,008 $ 778 $ 592 29.6 % 31.4 %
International 606 533 392 13.7 % 36.0 %
Worldwide $ 1,614 $ 1,311 $ 984 23.1 % 33.2 %

POMALYST®/IMNOVID® net sales increased by $303 million, or 23.1%, to approximately $1.6 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased sales in the U.S. and to a lesser extent international markets. In the U.S., sales growth increased primarily due to an increase in unit sales and, to a lesser extent, price increases. In addition, unit sales increased across all international regions, primarily in Europe. Increases in market share and treatment duration contributed to the increases in U.S. and international regions. International volume growth was partially offset by net price decreases.

POMALYST®/IMNOVID® net sales increased by $327 million, or 33.2%, to approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $778 million in the U.S. and $533 million in international markets. Increases in treatment duration contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST®/IMNOVID®. Achieving reimbursement in additional countries, notably in Japan, also contributed to the growth of POMALYST®/IMNOVID® net sales in international markets.

OTEZLA®

------------- ---- ----- ---- --- ---- ----- ---------------- ---------------- ---- - ----- - ----- -

 Percent Change
 2017 2016 2015 2017 versus 2016 2016 versus 2015
U.S. $ 1,058 $ 904 $ 440 17.0 % 105.5 %
International 221 113 32 95.6 % 253.1 %
Worldwide $ 1,279 $ 1,017 $ 472 25.8 % 115.5 %

OTEZLA® net sales increased by $262 million, or 25.8%, to approximately $1.3 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased worldwide unit sales. Net sales in the U.S. were volume driven reflecting increased market share and expanding patient access. We anticipate a slowing in market growth, offset by continued market share expansion in the U.S. due to new managed care contracts, as well as increasing contributions from early launch countries in Europe, the launch in Japan, and launches subsequent to additional international approvals. International volume growth was partially offset by net price decreases.

OTEZLA® net sales increased by $545 million to approximately $1.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $904 million in the U.S. and $113 million in international markets. As 2016 was the second full year on the market in the U.S., growth in the U.S. reflects increased market share and expanding accessibility to patients. Sales in international markets continued to expand during 2016, with growing sales in early launch countries in Europe and additional international approvals.

ABRAXANE®

------------- ---- --- ---- --- ---- --- ---------------- ---------------- ---- - ---- -- ---- --

 Percent Change
 2017 2016 2015 2017 versus 2016 2016 versus 2015
U.S. $ 607 $ 634 $ 653 (4.3 )% (2.9 )%
International 385 339 314 13.6 % 8.0 %
Worldwide $ 992 $ 973 $ 967 2.0 % 0.6 %

38

ABRAXANE® net sales increased by $19 million, or 2.0%, to $992 million for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in unit sales in international markets. The increase was partially offset by decreased unit sales in the U.S. The decrease in U.S. unit sales reflects the continuing competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications.

ABRAXANE® net sales increased by $6 million, or 0.6% to $973 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased unit sales, which were partially offset by price decreases. The decrease in U.S. sales was due to volume decreases partly offset by price increases. The decrease in U.S. sales reflects the increased competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications from new market entrants.

OTHER PRODUCT SALES

------------- ---- --- ---- --- ---- --- ---------------- ---------------- --- - ----- -- ----- --

 Percent Change
 2017 2016 2015 2017 versus 2016 2016 versus 2015
U.S. $ 211 $ 248 $ 304 (14.9 )% (18.4 )%
International 690 662 633 4.2 % 4.6 %
Worldwide $ 901 $ 910 $ 937 (1.0 )% (2.9 )%

All other product sales, which include IDHIFA®, VIDAZA®, azacitidine for injection, which is an authorized generic version of VIDAZA® (generic azacitidine for injection), THALOMID®, and ISTODAX®, decreased by $9 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreases in generic azacitidine for injection and THALOMID® net sales, which were partially offset by increases in net sales from the launch of IDHIFA® and VIDAZA® net sales.

All other product sales, decreased by $27 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in THALOMID® and generic azacitidine for injection net sales, which were partially offset by increases in VIDAZA® and ISTODAX® net sales.

Other Revenue: Other revenue decreased by $14 million to $30 million for 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in royalty revenue from Novartis AG (Novartis) based upon its sales of both RITALIN® and FOCALIN XR®, both of which have been unfavorably impacted by generic competition in certain markets. Beginning in fiscal 2018, we are no longer entitled to receive royalties on RITALIN® and FOCALIN XR®.

Other revenue decreased by $51 million to $44 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $36 million decrease in royalty revenue from Novartis based upon its sales of both RITALIN® and FOCALIN XR®, both of which were unfavorably impacted by generic competition in certain markets.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees, sales discounts, and sales returns and allowances.

REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID® are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS® and THALOMID REMS® programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID®. Internationally, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® and IMNOVID® are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities’ specifications to provide for the product’s safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® and VIDAZA® are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene®.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient’s cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap

39

responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.

Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.

See Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.

A comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for 2017 and 2016 follows:

2017 compared to 2016: Government rebate provisions increased by $202 million for 2017 compared to 2016, which was primarily due to a $122 million increase in the U.S. market and an $80 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $120 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $2 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $324 million for 2017 compared to 2016. Chargebacks increased by approximately $127 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $197 million. The increase in chargebacks was primarily due to higher sales volumes and a greater portion of sales qualifying for chargeback rebates, including a $13 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volumes. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes and new managed care contracts effective January 1, 2017 for OTEZLA®, which accounted for $154 million of the increase, as well as a $22 million increase in commercial copayment program expense and a $14 million increase in the distributor service fee expense, both of which also were attributable to higher sales volumes.

Discount provisions increased by $40 million for 2017 compared to 2016, which was primarily due to a $37 million increase in the U.S. market and a $3 million increase in international discounts, both due to higher sales volumes. The U.S. market increase was comprised of an increase of $24 million related to REVLIMID® as well as increases related to OTEZLA® and POMALYST®.

Provisions for sales returns decreased by $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a reduction in the ABRAXANE® returns reserve allowance.

A comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for 2016 and 2015 follows:

2016 compared to 2015: Government rebate provisions increased by $269 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $121 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes for our primary products in Europe and increased international rebate rates, as well as an adjustment of our accrual to reflect higher rebate rates for IMNOVID® in France. The increase in the allowance for sales of IMNOVID® in France related to prior periods was $15 million and the increase for sales of IMNOVID® in the current year due to higher rebate

41

rates in France was $23 million. The $148 million increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $108 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $40 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $211 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Chargebacks increased by approximately $140 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $71 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes, including an $11 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volume and increased rebate rates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA®, which accounted for $64 million of the increase in distributor service fees.

Discount provisions increased by $41 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $41 million increase consisted of a $37 million increase in the United States and a $4 million increase related to international markets. The U.S. increases included increases of $21 million for cash discounts related to REVLIMID®, $12 million related to OTEZLA® and $4 million related to POMALYST®.

Provisions for sales returns decreased by $5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the ABRAXANE® allowances for sales returns being $5 million higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to an increase in inventory levels held by certain distributors in 2015.

Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets): Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- --- ---- --- --- - - ---

 2017 2016 2015
Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 461 $ 438 $ 420
Increase from prior year $ 23 $ 18 $ 34
Percent increase from prior year 5.3 % 4.3 % 8.9 %
Percent of net product sales 3.6 % 3.9 % 4.6 %

Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $23 million to $461 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 3.6% for 2017 compared to 3.9% for 2016, primarily due to REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and OTEZLA®, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE®, VIDAZA® and generic azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.

Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $18 million to $438 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 3.9% for 2016 compared to 4.6% for 2015, primarily due to OTEZLA® and POMALYST®, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE® and generic azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.

Research and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and milestone payments resulting from collaboration arrangements and expenses for research and development asset acquisitions.

Research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

-------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Research and development $ 5,915 $ 4,470 $ 3,697
Increase from prior year $ 1,445 $ 773 $ 1,266
Percent increase from prior year 32.3 % 20.9 % 52.1 %
Percent of total revenue 45.5 % 39.8 % 39.9 %

Research and development expenses increased by approximately $1.4 billion to approximately $5.9 billion in 2017, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an IPR&D asset impairment charge of approximately $1.6 billion as well as other one-time charges of approximately $188 million related to wind-down costs and certain development activities associated with the

42

discontinuation of the GED-0301 clinical trials in CD. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to the discontinuation of the Trials. In addition, there was an increase of $253 million in clinical trial and drug discovery and development activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $568 million of research and development asset acquisition expenses. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to our acquisitions. Our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the volume and timing of closing asset acquisitions and collaboration arrangements and associated obligations pursuant to such arrangements.

Research and development expenses increased by $773 million to $4.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to $893 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab, Acetylon, and Triphase as well as increases in activity in support of our early- to mid-stage product pipeline, partially offset by decreases in expenses related to collaboration arrangements. See Note 2 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to our research and development asset acquisitions and collaboration arrangements, respectively.

The following table provides a breakdown of research and development expenses (in millions):

We make significant investments in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support both our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. See Item 1. "Business" for a table summarizing the current stage of development of both our commercial stage products and new drug candidates. See Note 2 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to certain of our acquisitions and collaboration arrangements, respectively.

We do not collect costs on a project basis or for any category of projects for the majority of costs involved in carrying out research projects. While we do perform cost calculations to facilitate our internal evaluation of individual projects, these calculations include significant estimations and allocations that are not relevant to, or included in, our external financial reporting mechanisms. As a consequence, we do not report research and development costs at the project level.

Selling, General and Administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs for employees included in our sales, marketing, finance, legal and administrative organizations, costs related to the launch of new products or those approved for new indications, outside professional services, donations to independent non-profit patient assistance organizations in the United States and facilities costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

----------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Selling, general and administrative $ 2,941 $ 2,658 $ 2,305
Increase from prior year $ 283 $ 353 $ 277
Percent increase from prior year 10.6 % 15.3 % 13.7 %
Percent of total revenue 22.6 % 23.7 % 24.9 %

43

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $283 million to approximately $2.9 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher litigation-related loss contingency accrual expenses incurred in 2017. During 2017, we recorded a litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense of $315 million related to the Brown Action, which represented our probable and reasonably estimable risk of loss. We reached a settlement agreement with respect to the Brown Action during the third quarter of 2017. During 2016, we recorded a $199 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense with respect to the lawsuit filed against us by Children's Medical Center Corporation (CMCC), which represented our probable and reasonably estimable risk of loss at that time. Subsequently, we reached a settlement agreement with CMCC during the first quarter of 2017. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to these legal matters. Additionally, the increase was also due to an increase of $70 million in donations to independent non-profit patient assistance organizations in the U.S. and approximately a $40 million increase in selling and marketing activities.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $353 million to $2.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $199 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense, and approximately a $90 million increase in selling and marketing activities. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to the litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets:

Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 329 $ 459 $ 279
(Decrease) increase from prior year $ (130 ) $ 180 $ 21
Percent increase (decrease) from prior year (28.3 )% 64.5 % 8.1 %

Amortization of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

------------------ ---- --- ---- --- ---- --- --- - ---

 2017 2016 2015

Gloucester 92 92 62
Pharmion 4 4 4
Quanticel 72 72 14
Total amortization $ 329 $ 459 $ 279

Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $130 million to $329 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily related to the prior year accelerated amortization expense and impairment charge to write down the technology platform asset obtained in the acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (Avila).

Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased by $180 million to $459 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in amortization expense primarily related to an $83 million impairment charge as well as $18 million of accelerated amortization expense, both related to the technology platform obtained in the Avila acquisition, amortization of the technology platform acquired in the October 2015 acquisition of Quanticel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Quanticel), and a reduction in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Gloucester) following the grant to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC of a non-exclusive, royalty-free sublicense to manufacture and market a generic version of romidepsin for injection as of February 1, 2018.

Acquisition Related (Gains) Charges and Restructuring, net: Acquisition related charges and restructuring, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

---------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- -- ---- ---- -- - ---

 2017 2016 2015
Acquisition related (gains) charges, net $ (1,350 ) $ 22 $ 290
Restructuring charges, net — 16 10
Total $ (1,350 ) $ 38 $ 300
Increase (decrease) from prior year $ (1,388 ) $ (262 ) $ 251

44

Acquisition related (gains) charges and restructuring charges, net decreased by approximately $1.4 billion in 2017 to a net gain of $1,350 million. The decrease was primarily due to an approximately $1.3 billion net gain recorded in 2017 for the reduction of the Nogra Pharma Limited (Nogra) contingent liability due to the discontinuation of the GED-0301 Trials. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details related to the change in fair value of the Nogra contingent consideration liability.

Acquisition related (gains) charges and restructuring, net decreased by $262 million to $38 million in 2016 compared to $300 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $297 million reduction in costs related to the acquisition of Receptos, Inc. which occurred in August 2015 and a $61 million increase in the benefit recorded for adjustments to contingent consideration issued as part of the acquisition of Avila related to adjustments made to estimates of probability and timing of future potential milestone payments payable to the former shareholders of Avila. These benefits were partly offset by a $77 million reduction in benefit recorded for fair value adjustments to our liability related to publicly traded contingent value rights (CVRs) that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (Abraxis), an $8 million increase in expense related to our contingent liabilities for the Quanticel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition, and a $6 million increase in restructuring charges in 2016 related to our relocation of certain operations into our two Summit, NJ locations as well as costs associated with certain headcount reductions.

Interest and Investment Income, Net: Interest and investment income, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in millions):

---------------------------------------------- ----- --- ---- ---- ---- -- ---- - - --

Increase (decrease) from prior year $ 75 $ (1 ) $ 3
Percentage increase (decrease) from prior year 250.0 % (3.2 )% 10.7 %

Interest and investment income, net which includes the net income associated with our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities, increased by $75 million to $105 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher investment balances and higher yields compared to the prior year.

Interest and investment income, net decreased by $1 million to $30 million in 2016 compared to 2015.

Interest Expense: Interest expense is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in millions):

 2017 2016 2015
Interest expense $ 522 $ 500 $ 311
Increase from prior year $ 22 $ 189 $ 135
Percentage increase from prior year 4.4 % 60.8 % 76.7 %

Interest expense increased by $22 million to $522 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to interest expense associated with the issuance of $500 million of senior notes in August 2017 and $3.000 billion of senior notes in November 2017. For more information related to our debt issuances, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest expense increased by $189 million to $500 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to interest expense associated with the issuance of $8.000 billion of senior notes in August 2015.

Income Tax Provision: The income tax provision increased by approximately $1.0 billion to approximately $1.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily from the impact of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 31.8%, an increase of 16.1 percentage points from our effective tax rate of 15.7% for 2016. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a 29.4 percentage point increase related to the one-time tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. This increase was partially offset by excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation deductions, for which our 2017 effective tax rate was reduced by 6.7 percentage points (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), U.S. research and development and orphan drug tax credits, for which our 2017 effective tax rate was reduced by 1.3 percentage points, and an increase in pre-tax earnings from jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, all of which were partially offset by a non-recurring prior year tax benefit related to a loss on our investment in Avila. The tax benefits recognized in 2017 for U.S. research and development and orphan drug tax credits were the result of a change in estimate upon completion of a comprehensive analysis (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Our effective tax rate is a function of the distribution of our pre-tax income among the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Our pre-tax income is earned and taxed in either the U.S. at a statutory tax rate of 35%, or outside the U.S. at significantly lower statutory tax rates. Our future effective tax rate is expected to be materially impacted by the 2017 Tax Act, which, among other changes, reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and introduces a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings referred to as GILTI at an effective tax rate of 10.5% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 (increasing to 13.125% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025). See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to the 2017 Tax Act. Our future effective tax rate can also be materially impacted by shifts in the distribution of our pre-tax income among the jurisdictions where we operate, the timing and amount of tax benefits from employee stock compensation, payments to collaboration partners, acquisitions, divestitures, changes in tax laws, audit settlements, and many other factors which are difficult to forecast.

The income tax provision decreased by $48 million to $373 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in the effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in income before taxes. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 15.7%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.8%. The 5.1 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of tax benefits related to a loss on our investment in Avila, offset by a non-deductible pre-tax charge related to our acquisition of Acetylon and non-recurring charges to tax expense recorded in 2015 related to both the global mix of funding sources for payments to collaboration partners, primarily the initiation of our collaborations with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) and Juno, and an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets obtained in our acquisition of Receptos, Inc. (Receptos).

1 Includes Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable securities available-for-sale, Accounts receivable, net of allowances, Inventory and Other current assets, less Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt, Accounts payable, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the current portion of Income taxes payable.

We rely primarily on positive cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale marketable securities and borrowings in the form of long-term notes payable and short-term commercial paper to provide for our liquidity requirements. We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and development, clinical trials, commercialization of new products, international expansion and capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, marketable securities available-for-sale, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to fund our operating needs, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and our plans to purchase our stock and pursue strategic business initiatives for the foreseeable future.
Many of our operations are conducted outside the United States and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately $6.0 billion of these short-term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and the toll charge, we expect to have access to this cash with minimal to no additional U.S. tax impact. Therefore, we no longer consider these funds permanently reinvested offshore. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany transactions, as well as for other reasons, such as repurchases of our common stock, internal reorganizations, business-development activities, restrictions on distributions out of foreign tax jurisdictions and debt issuances. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Under the 2017 Tax Act, a company’s post-1986 previously untaxed foreign E&P are mandatorily deemed to be repatriated and taxed, which is also referred to as the toll charge. The toll charge is assessed regardless of whether or not a company has cash in its foreign subsidiaries and irrespective of whether the company will actually bring back its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. However, the charge can be paid in installments over eight years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $1,890 million which represents the toll charge liability for the deemed repatriation of E&P. We have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years, or through 2025. However, the toll charge liability is not discounted on our financial statements. As such, we have recorded $1,732 million and $150 million as a non-current and current income tax liability, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. In prior years, we recorded U.S. deferred tax liabilities of $317 million for certain offshore earnings that were expected to be remitted to our domestic operations. These deferred tax liabilities reduced the income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the toll charge. The remaining amounts earned overseas were expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States, and therefore, no accrual for U.S. taxes was provided.
Share Repurchase Program: Since April 2009, our Board of Directors has approved an aggregate $20.5 billion common stock repurchase program of which we have approximately $822 million remaining for future repurchases as of December 31, 2017. During 2017, we used $3.9 billion for repurchases of our common stock, measured on a settlement date basis.

Components of Working Capital

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds, repurchase agreements, time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), an ultra short income fund, global corporate debt securities, asset backed securities and ultra-short income fund investments. All liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities available-for-sale. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The $4.1 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to approximately $5.2 billion of cash from operating activities and $611 million of net unrealized holding gains on marketable securities available-for-sale, which were partially offset by approximately $1.6 billion of net cash used in financing activities.

Marketable securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges, is included in interest and investment income, net. For more information related to the fair value and valuation of our marketable securities, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information related to the accounting treatment, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, for our equity investments, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Accounts Receivable, Net: Accounts receivable, net increased by $300 million to approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Sales made outside the United States typically have payment terms that are greater than 60 days, thereby extending collection periods beyond those in the United States. We expect our accounts receivable balance to grow as our international sales continue to expand.

We continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, the sovereign debt situation in certain European countries and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. Our current business model in these markets is typically to sell our hematology and oncology products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals, which in turn directly deliver critical care to patients. Many of our products are used to treat life-threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of products. Many of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government-funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible. Similarly, we believe that future sales to these customers will continue to be collectible.

Inventory: Inventory balances increased by $43 million to $541 million at the end of 2017 compared to 2016.

Other Current Assets: Other current assets decreased by $391 million to $388 million at the end of 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases of $347 million in the fair value of derivative instruments and $112 million in prepaid taxes, which were partially offset by $68 million of net other increases.

Commercial Paper: We have a commercial paper program (Program) under which we issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper) on a private placement basis, the proceeds of which are used for general corporate purposes. In April 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the maximum amount of Commercial Paper issuable to $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2017, we had available capacity to issue up to $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper and there were no borrowings under the Program. The maturities of the Commercial Paper may vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms to a dealer or in the commercial paper market and is issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, is sold at par and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Borrowings under the Program, if any, are accounted for as short-term borrowings.

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility: We maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that provides revolving credit in the aggregate amount of $2.0 billion, which was increased from $1.8 billion in April 2016. We extended the Credit Facility in April 2017 from April 17, 2021 to April 17, 2022. Amounts may be borrowed in U.S. Dollars for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility currently serves as backup liquidity for our Commercial Paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, there was no outstanding borrowing against the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Agreement contain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain customary financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2017.

48

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $466 million to approximately $2.8 billion at the end of 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of $250 million for sales adjustment accruals, $188 million of one-time charges related to GED-0301 wind-down costs associated with discontinuing the Trials and certain development activities, $92 million for clinical trials and research and development expense accruals, $73 million for accounts payable and other accruals, $64 million for derivative accruals, $39 million related to collaboration agreement accruals and $15 million for contingent consideration accruals, which includes the net change in fair value (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) as well as transfers from long-term liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a $199 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual recorded in 2016 (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and a decrease of $56 million for compensation related accruals.

Income Taxes Payable (Current and Non-Current): Income taxes payable increased by $2.1 billion to approximately $2.6 billion at the end of 2017 compared to 2016, primarily from the current provision for income taxes of $2.7 billion, partially offset by income tax payments of $0.5 billion and income tax receivables of $0.1 billion. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to the 2017 Tax Act.

Senior Notes: We have an aggregate of $15.850 billion principal amount of senior notes outstanding with varying maturity dates from 2019 through 2047. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):

--------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ------ ------------------- -------------- ------ - - ------ - - ------ -

 Increase (Decrease)
 2017 2016 2015 2017versus2016 2016versus2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,246 $ 4,165 $ 2,785 $ 1,081 $ 1,380
Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,891 ) $ (1,002 ) $ (6,259 ) $ (1,889 ) $ 5,257
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (1,584 ) $ (1,834 ) $ 4,283 $ 250 $ (6,117 )

Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $1.1 billion to approximately $5.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $941 million in 2017 compared to 2016.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $1.4 billion to approximately $4.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $397 million in 2016 compared to 2015, which included a $492 million net increase in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for items such as impairment charges, derivative activities, changes in deferred income taxes and amortization expenses compared to 2015. Derivative activities during 2016 included cash receipts of $196 million related to the settlement of interest rate swap contracts that had been designated as fair value hedges of certain of our fixed rate notes. Increases in net cash provided by operating activities were also driven by a $420 million increase in change in other operating assets primarily attributable to a $298 million decrease in prepaid taxes and a $92 million increase in change in accounts payable and other operating liabilities primarily attributable to an increase of $199 million of accrued expenses related to a litigation-related loss contingency accrual as well as other balance sheet fluctuations.

Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $1.9 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the approximately $2.5 billion of net purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale during 2017 compared to $648 million of net purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale during 2016.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $5.3 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the purchases of Receptos and Quanticel in 2015 without a corresponding purchase in 2016, resulting in a cash usage of approximately $7.7 billion during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net purchases and sales of marketable securities available for sale. Net purchases of marketable securities available for sale during 2016 amounted to a net cash usage of $648 million during 2016 compared to net cash proceeds of approximately $1.9 billion from net sales of marketable securities available for sale during 2015.

49

Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $250 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the August 2017 and November 2017 debt issuances partially offset by principal repayments in August 2017 and debt redemptions in December 2017. In August 2017, we issued an additional $500 million principal amount of 2.250% senior notes due 2021 and received net cash proceeds of approximately $496 million. In August 2017, we repaid the 1.900% senior notes with a principal amount of $500 million upon maturity. In November 2017, we issued an additional $3.0 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $750 million principal amount of 2.750% due 2023, $1.0 billion principal amount of 3.450% due 2027 and $1.250 billion principal amount of 4.350% due 2047 and received net cash proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion. In December 2017, we paid approximately $1.4 billion to redeem all of the outstanding $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% senior notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.300% senior notes, each maturing in August 2018. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. In addition to the debt activity, net cash used in financing activities decreased due to the approximately $3.8 billion of payments under our share repurchase program during 2017 compared to approximately $2.2 billion of payments under our share repurchase program during 2016.

Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $1.8 billion in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $4.3 billion in 2015. The approximately $6.1 billion decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the 2015 issuance of long-term debt which provided approximately $7.9 billion.

Contractual Obligations
The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):

-------------------------------------------- --------------------- ----- ------------ --- ------------ ----- ---------------- ----- ----- ----- ------ - ------

 Payment Due By Period
 Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 Years Total
Senior notes $ 605 $ 3,700 $ 3,503 $ 16,857 $ 24,665
Operating leases 56 89 57 33 235
Other contract commitments 399 159 103 134 795
2017 Tax Act - Federal toll charge liability 150 301 301 1,130 1,882
Total $ 1,210 $ 4,249 $ 3,964 $ 18,154 $ 27,577

Senior Notes: The senior note obligation amounts include future principal of $15.850 billion and interest payments for both current and non-current obligations as of December 31, 2017. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details.

Operating Leases: We lease office and research facilities under various operating lease agreements in the United States and various international markets. The non-cancelable lease terms for operating leases expire at various dates between 2018 and 2025 and include renewal options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements refer to Part I, Item 2. "Properties" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Contract Commitments: Other contract commitments of $795 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily included $748 million in contractual obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we have committed to invest an aggregate $47 million in investment funds, which are callable at any time.

2017 Tax Act: Under the 2017 Tax Act, a company’s post-1986 previously untaxed foreign E&P are mandatorily deemed to be repatriated and taxed, which is also referred to as the toll charge. The toll charge is assessed regardless of whether or not a company has cash in its foreign subsidiaries and irrespective of whether the company will actually bring back its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. However, the charge can be paid in installments over eight years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $1,890 million which represents the toll charge liability for the deemed repatriation of E&P. We have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years, or through 2025. However, the toll charge liability is not discounted on our financial statements. As such, we have recorded $1,732 million and $150 million as a non-current and current income tax liability, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Collaboration Arrangements and Acquired Research and Development Assets: We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties and have acquired research and development assets from third parties with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or

50

the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones over a period of several years are inherently uncertain, and accordingly, no amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential milestone payments (not including potential royalty payments) total approximately $10.7 billion, including approximately $5.6 billion contingent on the achievement of various research, development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately $5.1 billion in sales-based milestones. For additional information about our acquisitions of research and development assets and collaboration arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 17, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Uncertain Tax Positions: We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Accordingly, we have not included obligations for uncertain tax positions in our table of contractual obligations (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

New Accounting Standards

For a discussion of new accounting standards please see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical:

Revenue Recognition: Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Provisions for discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis.

We recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees' sales of our products or products using our technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees.

REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID® are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID REMS®, POMALYST REMS® and THALOMID REMS® programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID®. Internationally, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® and IMNOVID® are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities’ specifications to provide for the product’s safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX®, VIDAZA® and IDHIFA® are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene®.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated

51

historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient’s cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.

Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers, historical payment patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions, including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or areas within such countries where they are the ultimate customers.

Income Taxes: We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.

We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. As of December 31, 2017, it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.

52

Share-Based Compensation: We utilize share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock units, or PSUs. Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period required to obtain full vesting. Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest. If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized to date associated with grants that are not expected to vest will be reversed.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Available-For-Sale Marketable Securities: A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established. The determination of whether an available-for-sale marketable security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuer's earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash flows from the security, our intent not to sell, an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis, and issues that raise concerns about the issuer's ability to continue as a going concern. Assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities: All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the nature and relationships
between the hedging instruments and hedged item. We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether derivative instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange, our stock price and interest rates. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost.

Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging" (ASU 2017-12), we were required to separately measure and reflect the amount by which the hedging instrument did not offset the changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items, which was referred to as the ineffective amount. We assessed hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and recorded the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2017-12, we are no longer required to separately measure and recognize hedge ineffectiveness. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-12, we no longer recognize hedge ineffectiveness in our Consolidated Statements of Income, but we instead recognize the entire change in the fair value of:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• cash flow hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in Other comprehensive income (loss). The amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) will subsequently be reclassified to earnings in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income as impacted by the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, we excluded option premiums and forward points (excluded components) from our assessment of hedge effectiveness for our foreign exchange cash flow hedges. We recognized all changes in fair value of the excluded components in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 continue to allow those components to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, which we have elected to continue to apply. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2017-12, we no longer recognize changes in the fair value of the excluded components in Other income (expense), net, but we instead recognize the initial value of the excluded component on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, within the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.

53

Investments in Other Entities: We hold a portfolio of investments in equity securities and certain investment funds that are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method. Investments in companies or certain investment funds over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method, with our share of earnings or losses reported in Other income (expense), net. Investments in equity securities of companies that become publicly traded and are not classified as equity method investments are accounted for as available-for-sale marketable securities prospectively from the date of such companies' initial public offering.

Our cost method and equity method investments are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

All investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment's fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that raise concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern; any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment.

Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:  We have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a three-year period. As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded liabilities for three separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently and ending December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Performance measures for each of the performance cycles are based on the following components: 37.5% on non-GAAP earnings per share (as defined in the LTIP); 37.5% on total non-GAAP revenue (as defined in the LTIP); and 25% on relative total shareholder return, which is a measurement of our stock price performance during the applicable three-year period compared with a group of other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.

Threshold, target and maximum cash payout levels are calculated as a percentage between 0% to 200% of each participant’s base salary at the time the LTIP was approved by the Compensation Committee. Such awards are payable in cash or common stock or a mixture of cash and common stock, which will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of award delivery. Share-based payout levels are calculated using the cash-based threshold, target and maximum levels, divided by the average closing price of Celgene stock for the 30 trading days prior to the commencement of each performance cycle. Therefore, final share-based award values are reflective of the stock price at the end of the measurement period. The Compensation Committee may determine that payments made in common stock are restricted from trading for a period of time. We accrue the long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control.

Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions concerning future non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP revenues and relative total shareholder return, as defined; the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to date for the performance period, expected results for the remainder of the performance period, operating trends, product development, pricing and competition.

Valuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, Other Assets and IPR&D: We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR&D through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D and technology platforms are acquired, we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:

- --------------------------------
• projecting regulatory approvals;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects or estimating future cash flows expected to be collected; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment by assessing qualitative

54

factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net assets are below their carrying amounts.

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur. Intangible assets related to IPR&D product rights are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. Such test entails completing an updated discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the IPR&D asset. If required, the impairment test for intangible assets with definite useful lives is completed by comparing an updated non-discounted cash flow model to the book value of the intangible asset.

Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination: We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date, and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of CVRs, adjustments to discount rates and periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Our contingent consideration liabilities were recorded in the acquisitions of Gloucester, Abraxis, Avila, Nogra, and Quanticel. The fair values of the Gloucester, Avila, Nogra, and Quanticel contingent consideration liabilities are based on the discount rate, probability and estimated timing of cash milestone payments to the former shareholders of each business. The fair value of the Abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on the quoted market price of the publicly traded CVRs.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

['s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical:

Revenue Recognition: Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Provisions for discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis.

We recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees']:

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary

[" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Contract Commitments: Other contract commitments of $795 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily included $748 million in contractual obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we have committed to invest an aggregate $47 million in investment funds, which are callable at any time.

2017 Tax Act: Under the 2017 Tax Act, a company’s post-1986 previously untaxed foreign E&P are mandatorily deemed to be repatriated and taxed, which is also referred to as the toll charge. The toll charge is assessed regardless of whether or not a company has cash in its foreign subsidiaries and irrespective of whether the company will actually bring back its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. However, the charge can be paid in installments over eight years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $1,890 million which represents the toll charge liability for the deemed repatriation of E&P. We have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years, or through 2025. However, the toll charge liability is not discounted on our financial statements. As such, we have recorded $1,732 million and $150 million as a non-current and current income tax liability, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.

Collaboration Arrangements and Acquired Research and Development Assets: We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties and have acquired research and development assets from third parties with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or

the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones over a period of several years are inherently uncertain, and accordingly, no amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential milestone payments (not including potential royalty payments) total approximately $10.7 billion, including approximately $5.6 billion contingent on the achievement of various research, development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately $5.1 billion in sales-based milestones. For additional information about our acquisitions of research and development assets and collaboration arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 17, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Uncertain Tax Positions: We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Accordingly, we have not included obligations for uncertain tax positions in our table of contractual obligations (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management']:
Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...
