ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains
“forward-looking
statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates,
beliefs and expected performance. We caution you that assumptions,
expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the
differences can be material. See “Risk Factors” and
“Forward Looking
Statements.”

Overview

We are
an energy company engaged primarily in the acquisition,
exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas
shale plays in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (“D-J Basin”) in Colorado,
which contains hydrocarbon bearing deposits in several formations,
including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, J-Sand, and
D-Sand. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 10,961 net
D-J Basin acres located in Weld County, Colorado through our
wholly-owned subsidiary Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC
(“Red
Hawk”), which acreage is located in the Wattenberg and
Wattenberg Extension areas of the D-J Basin, which we refer to as
our “D-J Basin
Asset.” As of December 31, 2017, we held interests in
61 gross (17.4 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross
(12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and are currently
producing, 25 gross (4.9 net) wells are non-operated, and 22 wells
have an after-payout interest. During the quarter-ended
December 31, 2017, the Company produced an average of approximately
189 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) from its D-J
Basin Asset.

We
believe that the D-J Basin shale play represents among the most
promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We
plan to continue to seek additional acreage proximate to our
currently held core acreage located in the Wattenberg and
Wattenberg Extension areas of Weld County, Colorado. Our strategy
is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and
joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate
the pace of development in order to execute our business
plan.

We have
listed below the total production volumes and total
revenue net to the Company for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016, and 2015 attributable to our D-J Basin Asset that would
be net to our interest if reported on a consolidated basis,
including the calculated production volumes and revenue numbers for
our D-J Basin Asset held indirectly through Condor Energy
Technology LLC (“Condor”), an entity we
had a 20% interest in which we divested in February
2015.

Detailed
information about our business plans and operations, including our
core D-J Basin Asset is contained under “Part 1” —
“Item 1.
Business” beginning on page 5 of this Annual
Report.

The reserve estimates, including PV-10, set forth
above were prepared on February 6, 2018 by Tenet Advisory Group,
LLC (“TAG”). TAG is an independent professional
engineering firm certified by the Texas Board of Professional
Engineers (Registration number F-18903), under the direction of Joe
C. Bullard of TAG. TAG, and its employees, have no material
interest in our Company. TAG also performs oilfield operational and
engineering services for the Company pursuant to a Contract
Operating Services Agreement, dated January 16, 2017, entered into
by and between TAG and Red Hawk, the Company’s wholly-owned
operating subsidiary . The reserve estimates were prepared by TAG
using reserve definitions and pricing requirements prescribed by
the SEC. TAG estimated the proved reserves for our properties by
performance methods and analogy. All of the proved producing
reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs were
estimated by performance methods. These performance methods, such
as decline curve analysis, utilized extrapolations of historical
production and pressure data available through December 2017 in
those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The
data utilized were furnished to TAG by the Company or obtained from
public data sources. All of the proved developed nonproducing and
undeveloped reserves were estimated by analogy.

A
copy of the report issued by TAG is filed with this report as
Exhibit 99.1.

The
preliminary appraisal reports and changes in our reserves are
reviewed by Michael Peterson, our President and Chief Executive
Officer, for completeness of the data presented and reasonableness
of the results obtained. Mr. Peterson has over 15 years’
experience in the oil and gas industry. Once any questions have
been addressed, TAG issues the final appraisal reports, reflecting
their conclusions.

For more information regarding our oil and gas
reserves, please refer to “Supplemental Oil and
Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)” beginning on page F-31 of
this Annual Report, which information is incorporated by reference
in this “Item 2.
Properties”, by

How We Conduct Our Business and Evaluate Our
Operations

Our use
of capital for acquisitions and development allows us to direct our
capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive
opportunities as market conditions evolve. We have historically
acquired properties that we believe had significant appreciation
potential. We intend to continue to acquire both operated and
non-operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our
return objectives.

We will
use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the
performance of our oil and natural gas operations,
including:

●

production
volumes;

●

realized prices on
the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effects of our
commodity derivative contracts;

●

oil and natural gas
production and operating expenses;

●

capital
expenditures;

●

general and
administrative expenses;

●

net cash provided
by operating activities; and

●

net
income.

Production Volumes

Production volumes
will directly impact our results of operations. As of December 31,
2017, we hold interests in 61 gross (17.4 net) wells in our D-J
Basin Asset, of which 14 gross (12.5 net) wells are operated by Red
Hawk and are currently producing, 25 gross (4.9 net) wells are
non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout
interest. During the quarter-ended December 31, 2017, the
Company produced an average of approximately 189 net barrels of oil
equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) from its D-J
Basin Asset. Additionally, we expect to increase production
assuming drilling success in the future as we expand operations in
our D-J Basin Asset.

70

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook

We
expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant
operating losses as we continue to explore for and develop our oil
and natural gas prospects, and as we opportunistically invest in
additional oil and natural gas properties, develop our discoveries
which we determine to be commercially viable and incur expenses
related to operating as a public company and compliance with
regulatory requirements.

Our
future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by, among
other factors, the success of our exploration and appraisal
drilling program, the number of commercially viable oil and natural
gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas
discovered, the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to
production, and the actual cost of exploration, appraisal and
development of our prospects.

Our
current liquidity uses and debt service requirements are managed
under the terms of our senior debt facility whereby we are subject
to a cash sweep of our net revenues after operating costs. The debt
service arrangement provides for budgeted general and
administrative cost allowance of $150,000 each month which we
believe is sufficient to meet our foreseeable recurring
costs.  Such financing arrangement is sufficient to manage
recurring cash requirements but provides no additional funds for
extraordinary items, execution of our capital expenditure program
or the repayment of outstanding debt obligations other than our
senior debt facility.  Any equity funds we are able to raise
through offerings is not subject to the cash sweep and is not
subject to payment to or approval by the senior
lenders.

Subject
to the availability of the additional funding, which is not
currently in place and requires approval of our senior lenders in
the event of a debt offering, we plan to make capital expenditures,
excluding capitalized interest and general and administrative
expense, of up to approximately $8.37 million during the period
from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in order to achieve
our plans (with an additional 6.4 net wells to be drilled
and completed in 2019 for a combined total 2018-2019 drilling
capital budget of $34.85 million). We
expect our projected cash flow from operations combined with our
existing cash on hand, up to $2.0 million of gross proceeds
available from the issuance of our common shares through NSC under
our current “at the market offering” (of which $1.359 million remains available for
issuance, subject to limitation under the SEC’s “Baby
Shelf Rules”), and the approximately
$18.0 million available under our current senior debt facility
will be sufficient to fund our drilling plans and our operations
through 2019, noting that the
advancement of all or any portion of the approximately $18.0
million gross available under our current senior debt facility is
in the sole and absolute discretion of the senior lenders and no
senior lender is obligated to fund all or any part of the requested
funding.  See
“Part I, Item 1.
Business” — “Material 2016-2017
Transactions” — “Senior Debt
Restructuring” and “Part I” –
“Item 1A. Risk
Factors”, including “Our Tranche A Notes and Tranche B
Notes include various covenants, reduces our flexibility, increases
our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and
our costs.” In addition, we may seek additional
funding through asset sales, farm-out arrangements, lines of
credit, or public or private debt or equity financings to fund
additional 2018-2019 capital expenditures and/or repay or refinance
a portion or all of our outstanding debt.

Our
capital budget may be adjusted as business conditions warrant. The
amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely
discretionary and within our control. If oil and natural gas prices
continue to decline or fail to improve or costs increase
significantly, we could defer a significant portion of our budgeted
capital expenditures until later periods to prioritize capital
projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and
potential to generate near-term cash flows. We routinely monitor
and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in
prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs,
industry conditions, timing of regulatory approvals, availability
of rigs, success or lack of success in drilling activities,
contractual obligations, internally generated cash flows and other
factors both within and outside our control.

At The Market Offering

On
September 29, 2016, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales
Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with
National Securities Corporation (“NSC”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of National Holdings Corporation (NasdaqCM:NHLD),
pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its
common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to
$2,000,000 (the “Shares”) from time to
time, as the Company deems prudent, through NSC (the
“Offering”). Upon delivery
of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of
the Sales Agreement, NSC may sell the Shares by methods deemed to
be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415
promulgated under the Securities Act.

With
the Company’s prior written approval, NSC may also sell the
Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in
negotiated transactions. The Company may elect not to issue and
sell any Shares in the Offering and the Company or NSC may suspend
or terminate the offering of Shares upon notice to the other party
and subject to other conditions. NSC will act as sales agent on a
commercially reasonable efforts basis consistent with its normal
trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal law,
rules and regulations and the rules of the NYSE
American.

The
Company has agreed to pay NSC commissions for its services in
acting as agent in the sale of the Shares in the amount equal to
3.0% of the gross sales price of all Shares sold pursuant to the
Agreement. The Company also paid
various expenses in connection with the offering, including
reimbursing $30,000 of NSC’s legal fees, which has been paid
to date. The Company has also agreed to provide NSC with customary
indemnification and contribution rights.

The
Company has used, and intends to use, the net proceeds from the
offering to fund development and for working capital and general
corporate purposes, including general and administrative purposes.
The Company is not obligated to make any sales of common stock
under the Sales Agreement, and no assurance can be given that the
Company will sell any additional shares under the Sales Agreement
(other than as described below), or, if it does, as to the price or
amount of Shares that it will sell, or the dates on which any such
sales will take place.

The
Company has filed a final prospectus in connection with such
offering with the SEC (as part of the Form S-3 registration
statement). To date, we have sold an aggregate of 590,335 shares of
common stock under the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement and the
associated prospectus at prices ranging from $0.90 to $1.12 per
share for an aggregate purchase price of $641,000, to which an
underwriter’s fee of 3.0% was applied, leaving approximately
$1.36 million remaining available for issuance thereunder, subject
to limitation under the SEC’s “Baby Shelf
Rules”.

Secured Debt Funding

During
March 2014, we entered into the transactions contemplated by a Note
Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase”), between
the Company, BRe BCLIC Primary, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC
Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, and RJ Credit LLC
(“RJC”), as investors
(collectively, the “Investors”), and BAM
Administrative Services LLC, as agent for the Lenders (the
“Agent”) (upon notice received from the Agent on October
10, 2017, the Agent resigned as agent for the Lenders effective
December 31, 2017, and no replacement agent has been designated by
the Lenders subsequent to such date). Pursuant to the Note
Purchase, we sold the Investors Secured Promissory Notes in the
aggregate amount of $34.5 million (the “Initial
Notes”).

We
received $29,325,000 before expenses in connection with the sale of
the Initial Notes after paying the Investors an original issue
discount in connection with the sale of the Initial Notes of
$1,725,000 (5% of the balance of the Initial Notes); and an
underwriting fee of $3,450,000 (10% of the balance of the Initial
Notes). In connection with the Note Purchase, we also reimbursed
approximately $190,000 of the legal fees and expenses of the
Investors’ counsel, and paid Casimir Capital LP
(“Casimir”), our investment
banker in the transaction, a fee of $1,742,000, resulting in net
proceeds of approximately $27,393,000 which was received by us on
March 7, 2014.

72

From
time to time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Note
Purchase (including the requirement that we have deposited funds in
an aggregate amount of any additional requested loan into a
segregated bank account (the “Company Deposits”)), and
prior to the Maturity Date (defined below), we had the right to
request additional loans (to be evidenced by notes with
substantially similar terms as the Initial Notes, the
“Subsequent
Notes”, and together with the Initial Notes, the
“Senior
Notes”) from RJC, originally up to an additional $13.5
million in total or an aggregate of $50 million together with the
Initial Notes and approximately $2 million of Subsequent Notes
issued in 2014. We were required to pay original issue discounts in
the amount of 5% of the funds borrowed, underwriting fees in the
amount of 10% of the amount of the funds borrowed, reimburse
certain of the legal fees of RJC’s counsel, and pay
applicable fees to Casimir representing 5% of any funds borrowed,
in connection with funds borrowed under any Subsequent Notes. Funds
borrowed under any Subsequent Notes were only eligible to be used
by us, together with Company Deposits, for approved AFEs issued for
a well or wells to be drilled and completed on any properties
acquired in connection with the Continental Acquisition. The total
aggregate amount of any Subsequent Notes could not exceed $15.5
million and in the event we drill a dry hole, we are prohibited
from using the proceeds from the sale of any Subsequent Notes,
without the consent of RJC.

In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company
borrowed $1,967,000 for drilling activities (net proceeds of
$1,593,000, which was reduced from the $1,967,000 by debt discounts
of $276,000 related to underwriting fees and a 5%
original issue discount of $98,000). There were no borrowings made
under the Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2015. As
of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $13.5 million
gross ($11.0 million net, after origination-related fees and
expenses) available to draw down under Subsequent Notes from
RJC. The Notes are due and payable on March 7, 2017 (the
“Maturity
Date”), and may be repaid in full without premium or
penalty at any time. As a result of the May 12, 2016 restructuring of the Notes and Note
Purchase as described below, effective May 12, 2016, the Company
may no longer borrow additional funds from RJC under Subsequent
Notes, and the Maturity Date of the Notes have been revised as
described below.

As
additional consideration for the initial Note Purchase transaction
and for GGE agreeing to purchase the Subsequent Notes, GGE acquired
ownership of 50% of all of our oil and gas assets and properties
acquired in connection with the Continental Acquisition, and 50% of
our interests in our Kazakhstan non-core asset.

The
Notes initially bore interest at the rate of 15% per annum (subject
to the letter agreements described below), payable monthly in
arrears, on the first business day of each month beginning April 1,
2014 (in connection with the Initial Notes), provided that upon the
occurrence of an event of default, the Notes bear interest at the
lesser of 30% per annum and the maximum legal rate of interest
allowable by law. We can prepay all or any portion of the principal
amount of Notes, without premium or penalty. The Notes include
standard and customary events of default.

Additionally, we
are required on the third business day of each month, commencing on
April 1, 2014, to prepay the Notes in an amount equal to the lesser
of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the Notes or (b)
twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate of all net revenues
actually received by us and our subsidiaries (other than net
revenues received by Asia Sixth, unless and to the extent received
by us in the United States) or for the immediately preceding
calendar month (or such pro rata portion of the first month the
payment is required). The Notes also provide that RJC is to be
repaid (i) accrued interest, only after all of the other Investors
are repaid any accrued interest due and (ii) principal, only after
all of the other Investors are repaid the full amount of principal
due under their Notes, and (iii) that any funding in connection
with Subsequent Notes will be made solely by RJC.

The net
proceeds from the Initial Funding were used by us (along with funds
raised through the February 2014 sale of assets which were formerly
owned by White Hawk), to purchase assets located in Weld and Morgan
Counties, Colorado, from Continental.

73

On
April 24, 2015, certain of our Investors agreed to allow us to
defer the mandatory principal repayments and interest payments due
under the Notes for the months of May and June 2015, with such
deferred amounts to be used to renew, extend, re-lease or otherwise
acquire leases, which then became additional collateral under the
Notes. The aggregate principal and interest that was deferred was
approximately $524,000, which amount has been capitalized and added
to the principal due under the Notes and is due upon maturity. The
Company was also charged a one-time deferral fee of $354,000, the
amount of the principal and interest deferred under this agreement,
of which $320,000 was expensed as additional interest and the
balance was added to the principal and due upon maturity. As
additional consideration for the deferral, on September 10,
2015, we issued warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 34,911
shares of our common stock to the Investors participating in the
deferral. Each warrant had a 3 year term and was exercisable
on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $15.00 per
share.

On
August 28, 2015, we entered into agreements with the Investors to
(i) defer until the maturity date of the Notes the mandatory
principal payments that would otherwise be due and payable by us on
payment dates occurring during the six month period of August 1,
2015 through January 31, 2016, (ii) HEARTLAND Bank agreed to change
the frequency of payment of accrued interest and mandatory
principal repayments from monthly to semi-annually, with the next
interest payment due February 1, 2016 and the next mandatory
principal repayment due August 3, 2016, and with us agreeing to
place an amount equal to 1/6th of the semi-annual principal
and interest payments due into a sinking fund starting in February
2016 which we shall pay to HEARTLAND Bank every six months when due
and owing, (iii) RJC agreed to defer all interest payments
otherwise due and payable by us to RJC during the period commencing
on August 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016 (the “Waiver Period”), which
deferred interest is added to principal each month during the
Waiver Period, (iv) certain other holders agreed to (a) defer until
the maturity date of their Notes 12/17ths of the interest
payments that would otherwise be due and payable by us to them on
payment dates occurring during the six month period of August 1,
2015 through January 31, 2016, and (b) have us pay in cash
5/17ths of such interest payments per month, with all deferred
interest being added to principal each month until the maturity
date of the Notes, and (v) SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC
Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub and RJC agreed to increase the
interest rate under their Senior Notes from 15% to 17% per annum on
all outstanding principal under their Notes during the Waiver
Period. These deferrals agreed upon with our Investors (the
“August-January
Deferrals”) reduced our monthly cash interest payments
and mandatory principal repayments from approximately $600,000 per
month prior to these agreements, to approximately $100,000 per
month during the Waiver Period after giving effect to the changes
agreed upon under these agreements, thereby providing us with an
estimated $500,000 per month in reduced cash flow requirements
during the Waiver Period.

As
additional consideration for these agreements and related note
amendments and deferrals, on September 10, 2015, we issued warrants
exercisable on a cash-only basis for an aggregate of 120,101 shares
to the lenders, proportionately based on their individual
principal, which grants were subject to NYSE American additional
listing approval, which has been received. The warrants had a three
year term and were exercisable on a cash-only basis at a price of
$7.50 per share. In addition, in the event the aggregate total of
principal and interest deferred in connection with the
August-January deferrals exceeded $900,000 over the Waiver Period,
within thirty days of February 1, 2016, and subject to NYSE
American additional listing approval, we were required to
proportionately grant additional warrants such that the total
aggregate number of shares of our common stock exercisable under
all warrants granted will equal the total principal and interest
deferred by such Investors divided by $7.50.

In
addition, we agreed to prepare and deliver to RJC a monthly budget
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to RJC, and such
financial statements as RJC may reasonably request. The monthly
budget is required to include a cash flow forecast and detail of
all anticipated non-recurring expenses and non-cash budget items,
and we are required to comply with the budgeted expenses set forth
therein in all material respects, provided, however, that a
variance of less than 10% with respect to the expenses, on an
aggregate basis, is permitted.

74

On
January 29, 2016, we entered into a Letter Agreement (the
“Letter
Agreement”) with the Investors and the Agent. The
Letter Agreement extended by one (1) month, through February 29,
2016, the deferral of the payment of interest and principal due
under the Notes (the “Deferral Extension”). The
purpose of the Deferral Extension was to provide the Company with
the financial resources and runaway it believed it needed to
fully-focus upon and consummate the merger with GOM, which has now
been terminated. Specifically, pursuant to the Letter Agreement,
(i) all Investors agreed to further defer until the maturity date
of their Notes the mandatory principal payments that would
otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them on payment
dates occurring through February 29, 2016, (ii) HEARTLAND Bank
agreed to change the next scheduled semi-annual interest payment
due from February 1, 2016 to March 1, 2016 (with interest due and
payable thereafter on a semi-annual basis) and to change the next
mandatory principal repayment due date to September 3, 2016, and
the Company agreed to place an amount equal to 1/6th of the
semi-annual principal and interest payments due into a sinking fund
which the Company shall pay to HEARTLAND Bank every six months when
due and owing, and (iii) Senior Health Insurance Company of
Pennsylvania (“SHIP”) (as
successor-in-interest to BRe BCLIC Primary), BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe
WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, and RJC agreed to
(a) defer until the maturity date of their Notes and the junior
note held by RJC (the “RJC Junior Note”) all of
the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by
the Company to them in February 2016; (b) return the interest rate
under each of their Notes to 15% per annum, and the interest rate
under the RJC Junior Note to 12% cash pay per annum, effective
January 31, 2016; and (c) delay the issuance of any
“Subsequent
Warrants” issuable pursuant thereto to within 30 days
of March 1, 2016, subject to NYSE American additional listing
approval.

On
March 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement, dated
March 1, 2016 (the “March Letter Agreement”),
with SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013
LTC Sub, and RJC (collectively, the “Original Lenders”), and
the Agent, which extended the Deferral Extension by one (1) month,
through March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the March Letter Agreement, the
Original Lenders agreed to (i) further defer until the maturity
date of their Senior Notes the mandatory principal payments that
would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them on
payment dates occurring through March 31, 2016, (ii) defer until
the maturity date of their Senior Notes and the RJC Junior Note all
of the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by
the Company to them in March 2016, with all interest amounts
deferred being added to principal on the first business day of the
month following the month in which such deferred interest is
accrued; and (iii) delay the issuance of any “Subsequent Warrants”
issuable pursuant thereto to within 30 days of April 1, 2016,
subject to NYSE American additional listing approval.

On April 7, 2016, we entered into a Letter
Agreement, dated April 1, 2016 (the “Letter
Agreement”), with the
Investors. The Letter Agreement extended by one (1) month, through
April 30, 2016, the deferral of the payment of interest and
principal due under the Senior Notes and the Note and Security
Agreement, dated April 10, 2014, as amended on February 23, 2015,
issued by the Company to RJ Credit LLC (the
“RJC Junior
Note,” and together with
the Senior Notes, the “Notes”)(the
“Deferral
Extension”), entered into
with the Lenders on August 28, 2015, as amended on January 29, 2016
and March 7, 2016 (the “Original Deferral
Agreements”).
Specifically, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, all the Lenders
agreed to: (i) further defer until the maturity date of their
Senior Notes the mandatory principal payments that would otherwise
be due and payable by the Company to them on payment dates
occurring through April 30, 2016; (ii) defer until the maturity
date of their Senior Notes and the RJC Junior Note all of the
interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the
Company to them in April 2016, with all interest amounts deferred
being added to principal on the first business day of the month
following the month in which such deferred interest is accrued; and
(iii) delay the issuance of any “Subsequent
Warrants” (as defined in
the Original Deferral Agreements) issuable pursuant thereto to
within 30 days of May 1, 2016, subject to NYSE American additional
listing approval.

On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into
Amendment No. 2 to Note and Security Agreement with RJC (the
“Second
Amendment”), pursuant to
which the Company and RJC agreed to amend the RJC Junior Note to
(i) capitalize all accrued and unpaid interest under the RJC Junior
Note as of the date of the parties entry into the Second Amendment,
and add it to note principal, making the current outstanding
principal amount of the RJC Junior Note $9,379,000, (ii) extend the
“Termination
Date” thereunder (i.e.,
the maturity date) from December 31, 2017 to July 11, 2019, (iii)
provide that all future interest accruing under the RJC Junior Note
is deferred, due and payable on the Termination Date, with all
future interest amounts deferred being added to principal on the
first business day of the month following the month in which such
deferred interest is accrued, and (iv) subordinate the RJC Junior
Note to the Senior Notes.

75

Also on
May 12, 2016, the Company entered into the Amended NPA and
undertook the transactions contemplated therein, including selling
the New Senior Notes to the Lenders as described above under
“Part
I” –“Item 1. Business-Business
Operations-Material 2016-2017 Transactions” —
“Senior Debt
Restructuring”. Pursuant to the Amended NPA, the
Company created new “Tranche A Notes,” in
substantially the same form and with similar terms as the Tranche B
Notes, with certain exceptions as described above, consisting of a
term loan issuable in tranches with a maximum aggregate principal
amount of $25,960,000, with borrowed funds accruing interest at 15%
per annum, and maturing on May 11, 2019, under which Tranche A
Notes the Company may draw up to approximately $18.0 million
additional principal in accordance with their terms, including that
the lenders thereof approve such loans at their sole
discretion (see “Part I” –
“Item 1A. Risk
Factors”, including “Our Tranche A Notes and Tranche B
Notes include various covenants, reduces our flexibility, increases
our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and
our costs.”).

Amendment to PEDCO-MIEJ Note and Condor-MIEJ Note

On
February 19, 2015 (the “MIEJ Closing Date”), the
Company and PEDCO entered into a Settlement Agreement (the
“MIEJ Settlement
Agreement”) with MIEJ. MIEJ was PEDCO’s 80%
partner in Condor, and was the lender to PEDCO under that certain
Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, dated
March 25, 2013, in the principal amount of $6,170,065, entered into
by PEDCO and MIEJ (the “MIEJ Note”). Pursuant to
the MIEJ Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i) MIEJ and
PEDCO agreed to restructure the MIEJ Note through the entry into a
new Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note,
dated February 19, 2015 and with an effective date of January 1,
2015 (the “New MIEJ
Note”), (ii) PEDCO sold its (x) full 20% interest in
Condor to MIEJ (the “Condor Interests”), and
(y) interests in approximately 945 net acres and interests in three
(3) wells located in PEDCO’s legacy non-core Niobrara acreage
located in Weld County, Colorado, that were directly held by PEDCO
to Condor (the “PEDCO Direct Interests”),
effective January 1, 2015, and (iii) Condor forgave approximately
$1.8 million in previous working interest expenses related to the
drilling and completion of certain wells operated by Condor that
was due from PEDCO, which, in summary, had the net effect of
reducing approximately $9.4 million in aggregate liabilities due
from PEDCO to MIEJ and Condor to $4.925 million, which is the new
principal amount of the New MIEJ Note. In addition, pursuant to the
MIEJ Settlement Agreement, (a) in consideration for the PEDEVCO
Senior Loan Investors releasing their security interest on the
Condor Interests and PEDCO Direct Interests, MIEJ paid $500,000 to
the PEDEVCO Senior Loan Investors as a principal reduction on the
PEDEVCO Senior Loan, which directly benefits PEDEVCO, (b) PEDCO
paid $100,000 as a principal reduction under the MIEJ Note, (c)
each of MIEJ, Condor and the Company fully released each other, and
their respective predecessors and successors in interest, parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns, and their respective
officers, directors, managers, members, agents, representatives,
servants, employees and attorneys, from every claim, demand or
cause of action arising on or before the MIEJ Closing Date, and (d)
MIEJ confirmed that the MIEJ Note was paid in full and that PEDCO
owed no amounts to MIEJ or Condor other than the principal amount
due as reflected in the New MIEJ Note.

The New
MIEJ Note was effective January 1, 2015, bears an interest rate of
10.0% per annum with no interest due until Maturity (defined below)
or except as detailed below, is secured by all of our current and
after-acquired assets, and is subordinated in every way to the
Senior Notes as well as to New Senior Lending (defined below);
however, MIEJ has no control over the cash flow of the Company, nor
is MIEJ’s consent required in connection with any
disposition, sale, or use of any assets of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries at any time in the future, provided that the
requirements of the New MIEJ Note requiring the prepayment of
interest, where applicable, as described below are followed. After
the MIEJ Closing Date, the Company may enter into a loan, or a
series of new loans or any other new non-equity investment or
assumption of indebtedness (a “New Senior Lending”)
which will be senior to the New MIEJ Note, without the prior
consent of MIEJ, provided that, in addition to the approximately
$35 million principal balance of the Notes, the New Senior Lending
is subject to a cap of an additional $60 million in the aggregate,
such that the total lending, debt or similar investment under such
cap shall not exceed $95 million in the aggregate (the
“Senior Debt
Cap”), with any portion of New Senior Lending in
excess of the Senior Debt Cap advanced first to MIEJ until the New
MIEJ Note is paid in full. The New MIEJ Note shall automatically,
and without further consent from MIEJ, be subordinated in every way
to any such New Senior Lending. Should the Company enter into any
new financing transaction that results in raising New Senior
Lending of at least $20 million in excess of the balance of the
Notes, then MIEJ has a right to be paid all interest and fees that
have accrued on the New MIEJ Note each and every time that a new
financing transaction reaches or exceeds the $20 million
threshold.

76

 The New MIEJ
Note was originally due and payable on March 8, 2017, but is now
due and payable on March 8, 2019 due to an automatic maturity date
extension as a result of the May 2016 Senior Debt Restructuring,
and with such date also subject to additional automatic extensions
upon the occurrence of a Long-Term Financing or additional PEDEVCO
Senior Lending Restructuring (each as defined below) (the
“Maturity”). On a one-time
basis, the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be refinanced by a new loan
(“Long-Term
Financing”) by one or more third party replacement
lenders (“Replacement Lenders”),
and in such event we are required to undertake commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Replacement Lenders to
simultaneously refinance both the PEDEVCO Senior Loan and the New
MIEJ Note as part of such Long-Term Financing. Despite such
efforts, should the Replacement Lenders be unable or unwilling to
include the New MIEJ Note in such financing, then the Long-Term
Financing may proceed without including the New MIEJ Note, and the
New MIEJ Note shall remain in place and shall be automatically
subordinated, without further consent of MIEJ, to such Long-Term
Financing. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Long-Term
Financing, the Maturity of the New MIEJ Note is automatically
extended, without further consent of MIEJ, to the same maturity
date of the Long-Term Financing (the “Extended Maturity Date”),
provided that the Extended Maturity Date may not exceed March 8,
2020. Additionally, upon the closing of such Long-Term Financing:
(a) the Long-Term Financing is required to be subject to the Senior
Debt Cap, (b) we are required to make commercially reasonable best
efforts for the Long-Term Financing to include adequate reserves or
other payment provisions whereby MIEJ is paid all interest and fees
accrued on the New MIEJ Note commencing as of March 8, 2017 (and
annually thereafter, until such time as the New MIEJ Note is paid
in full), but in any event the Replacement Lenders are required to
agree to allow for quarterly interest payments (starting March 31,
2017) of not less than 5% per annum on the outstanding balance of
the New MIEJ Note, plus a one-time payment of accrued interest (not
to exceed $500,000) as of March 31, 2017 (the “Subordinated Interest
Payments”), and the remaining 5% interest shall
continue to accrue, and (c) MIEJ has the Right of Conversion
(defined below) commencing as of March 8, 2017, the original
maturity date of the New MIEJ Note. If the PEDEVCO Senior Loan
and/or New Senior Lending is not refinanced by Replacement Lenders,
but is instead refinanced, restructured or extended by the existing
PEDEVCO Senior Loan Investors (a “PEDEVCO Senior Lending
Restructuring”), the maturity of both the New MIEJ
Note and the PEDEVCO Senior Loan may be extended to no later than
March 8, 2019, without requiring the consent of MIEJ, provided that
(i) any such extension of the maturity date of the New MIEJ Note
past March 8, 2017 shall give MIEJ the Right of Conversion
(described below) commencing on March 8, 2017, and (ii) such
extension agreement shall include payment provisions whereby MIEJ
shall be paid all interest and fees accrued on the New MIEJ Note as
of March 8, 2018. The May 2016 Senior Debt Restructuring qualified
as a PEDEVCO Senior Lending Restructuring and the issuance of the
Tranche A Notes qualified as a New Senior Lending, the result of
which the Maturity of the New MIEJ Note has been extended to March
8, 2019. The New MIEJ Note may be prepaid any time without
penalty.

The New
MIEJ Note has a conversion feature that provides, in the event that
the final maturity of the New MIEJ Note is extended beyond March 8,
2017 for whatever reason, MIEJ has the right, at its discretion, to
have the outstanding balance of the New MIEJ Note plus any accrued
and unpaid interest thereon converted in whole or in part into our
common stock at a price (the “Conversion Price”) equal
to 80% of the average closing price per share of our common stock
over the then previous 60 days from the date MIEJ exercises its
conversion right (subject to adjustment for stock splits,
recapitalizations and the like)(such event, a “Right of Conversion”);
provided, however, that in no event shall the Conversion Price be
less than $3.00 per share (the “Floor Price”).
Additionally, the New MIEJ Note contains a provision preventing the
conversion of the MIEJ Note to the extent that such conversion
would result in more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock or
voting stock being issued in aggregate upon the conversion of such
note, or otherwise require shareholder approval under the NYSE
American rules. Notwithstanding that, we agreed to include a
proposal in our proxy statement for our 2016 annual meeting of our
shareholders (the “2016 Annual Meeting”) for
the approval of the issuance of the maximum number of shares of
common stock issuable in connection with conversion of the New MIEJ
Note, assuming conversion at the Floor Price (the
“Maximum Conversion
Shares”). At the 2016 Annual Meeting held on December
28, 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved the full
conversion of the New MIEJ Note and the New MIEJ Note is now fully
convertible into our common stock in accordance with its
terms.

77

Bridge Notes

On
March 7, 2014, we entered into the Second Amendment to Secured
Promissory Notes (each, an “Amended Note,” and
collectively, the “Amended Notes”) with all
but one of the investors holding our secured subordinated
promissory notes, originally issued on March 22, 2013, referred to
herein as the “Bridge
Notes”.

The
Amended Notes amended the bridge notes to allow the holders thereof
the right to convert up to 100% of the outstanding and unpaid
principal amount (but in increments of not less than 25% of the
principal amount of each bridge note outstanding as of the entry
into the Amended Notes and only up to four (4) total conversions of
not less than 25% each); the additional payment-in-kind cash amount
equal to 10% of the principal amount of each holder’s bridge
note which was deferred pursuant to the first amendment to such
notes; and all accrued and unpaid interest under each bridge note
(collectively, the “Conversion Amount”) into
our common stock, subject to an additional listing application
regarding such common stock being approved by the NYSE American.
Upon a conversion, the applicable holder shall receive that number
of shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the
Conversion Amount by a conversion price (the “Conversion Price”) as
follows:

(A)

prior to June 1,
2014, the Conversion Price was $21.50 per share; and

(B)

following June 1,
2014, the denominator used in the calculation described above is
the greater of (i) 80% of the average of the closing price per
share of our publicly-traded common stock for the five (5) trading
days immediately preceding the date of the conversion notice
provided by the holder; and (ii) $5.00 per share.

Additionally, each
bridge investor who entered into the Second Amendment to Secured
Promissory Note also entered into a Subordination and Intercreditor
Agreement in favor of the Agent, subordinating and deferring the
repayment of the bridge notes, and actions in connection with the
security interests provided under the bridge notes, until full
repayment of the Notes sold pursuant to the Note Purchase in March
2014, as described in greater detail above. The Subordination and
Intercreditor Agreements also prohibit us from repaying the bridge
notes until the Notes have been paid in full, except that we are
allowed to repay the bridge notes from net proceeds received from
the sale of common or preferred stock (i) in calendar year 2014 if
such net proceeds received in such calendar year exceeds
$35,000,000, (ii) in calendar year 2015 if such net proceeds
received in such calendar year exceeds $50,000,000, and (iii) in
calendar year 2016 if such net proceeds actually received in such
calendar year exceeds $50,000,000.

Through
the date hereof, holders of $1,900,000 of the original principal
amount of the Amended Notes have exercised their option to convert
a portion or all of their Amended Notes into common stock of the
Company. We issued an aggregate of 161,803 shares of common stock
of the Company to holders of the Amended Notes upon conversion of
an aggregate of $2,221,000 in principal, accrued interest, and
payment-in-kind outstanding under their Amended Notes (the
“Note
Conversions”), according to the terms of the Amended
Notes. Following the Note Conversions, an aggregate principal
amount of $475,000 of the original $4 million principal amount of
the bridge notes remain issued and outstanding, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and payment-in-kind, is convertible into common
stock of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Amended
Notes.

Financial Summary

We had
total current assets of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2017,
including cash of $0.9 million, compared to total current assets of
$1.3 million as of December 31, 2016, including a cash balance
of $0.7 million.

We had
total assets of $36.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and
$58.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Included in total assets as
of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $34.9 million and
$57.4 million, respectively, of proved oil and gas properties
subject to amortization and $-0- and $-0- million, respectively, in
unproved oil and gas properties not subject to
amortization,

78

We had
total liabilities of $73.5 million as of December 31, 2017,
including current liabilities of $3.4 million, compared to total
liabilities of $60.7 million as of December 31, 2016, including
current liabilities of $3.3 million.

We had
negative working capital of $2.0 million, total shareholders’
deficit of $37.1 million and a total accumulated deficit of $138.1
million as of December 31, 2017, compared to negative working
capital of $2.0 million, total shareholders’ deficit of $2.0
million and a total accumulated deficit of $101.7 million as of
December 31, 2016.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 with the Year Ended
December 31, 2016

Oil and Gas Revenue. For the year
ended December 31, 2017, we generated a total of $3,015,000 in
revenues, compared to $3,968,000 for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease of $953,000 was primarily due to a decline in
production from our oil and gas assets. This volume decline was a
result of a natural decline in well production and periodic wells
being shut-in.

Lease Operating Expenses. For the
year ended December 31, 2017, lease operating expenses associated
with the oil and gas properties were $1,348,000, compared to
$1,687,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of
$339,000 was primarily due to lower variable lease operating
expenses associated with the lower volume resulting from the
natural decline in well production and periodic wells being
shut-in.

Exploration Expense. For the year
ended December 31, 2017, exploration expense was $2,000
compared to $231,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The
decrease of $229,000 was primarily due to minimal exploration
activity undertaken by the Company in the current year due to
capital constraints.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, selling,
general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were
$2,529,000, compared to $3,912,000 for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease of $1,383,000 was primarily due to austerity
measures taken by management, including (i) a reduction in payroll
costs related to a work force reduction, and (ii) the reduction of
professional and other fees and expenses, including a significant
decrease in stock compensation expense that resulted from the grant
of fewer stock awards at lower stock prices during the current
year. The components of SG&A expense are summarized below
(amounts in thousands):

 For the Year Ended
-------------------------------------- ------------------ --------- ----------
 December 31, Increase/
 2017 2016 (Decrease)
Payroll and related costs $1,099 $1,331 $(232)
Stock-based compensation expense 655 1,476 (821)
Legal fees 126 113 13
Accounting and other professional fees 317 460 (143)
Insurance 108 105 3
Travel and entertainment 16 25 (9)
Office rent, communications and other 208 402 (194)
 $2,529 $3,912 $(1,383)

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization and
Accretion (“DD&A”). For the year ended
December 31, 2017, DD&A costs were $3,754,000, compared to
$5,080,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1,326,000
decrease was primarily the result of lower production volumes due
to a natural decline in well production.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, impairment of oil and gas
properties was $18,950,000, compared to $-0- for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The $18,950,000 increase was primarily the
result of an impairment taken for 2017 resulting from a delay in
the funding necessary to support the capital expenditures used in
the reserve report for development of the proven undeveloped
acreage.

79

Gain on Settlement of Payables. For
the year ended December 31, 2017, the gain on settlement of
payables was $-0- compared to a gain of $1,282,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The gain in 2016 was related to a
Settlement Agreement entered into with Liberty for vendor
obligations that was recorded during the year ended December 31,
2016.

Loss on Write-off of Cost Method
Investment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, loss
on write-off of cost method investment was $4,000, compared to a
loss on
write-off of cost method investment of $-0- for the year
ended December 31, 2016. The loss on write-off
of cost method investment for the year ended December 31,
2017 was related to the write-off of a minor
investment.

Total Other Income (Expense). For
the year ended December 31, 2017, other expense was $12,798,000,
compared to $13,959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The
decrease in total other expense of $1,161,000 was primarily due to
lower interest expense related to the amortization of debt
discount.

Net Loss. For the year ended
December 31, 2017, net loss was $36,370,000, compared to a net loss
of $19,619,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase
in net loss of $16,751,000 was primarily due to impairment of our
oil and gas properties partially offset by lower operating expenses
and interest expense for the reasons described above.

Cash Flows used in Operating
Activities. We had net cash used in operating
activities of $236,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which
was a decrease of $5,738,000 as compared to the prior year period
of $5,974,000. This decrease was primarily due to increases in
accounts payable and accrued expenses during the current
year.

Cash Flows used in Investing
Activities. We had net cash used in investing
activities of $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was
a decrease of $75,000 as compared to the prior year net cash used
of $75,000, due to no drilling costs in the current
year.

Cash Flows from Financing
Activities. We had net cash provided by financing
activities of $494,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which
was a decrease of $5,076,000 as compared to the prior year cash
provided of $5,570,000. This decrease was primarily a result of the
proceeds from notes payable in the prior year.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a
comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede
nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The standard’s core principle (issued as Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 by the
FASB), is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. These may include identifying
performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of
variable consideration to include in the transaction price and
allocating the transaction price to each separate performance
obligation. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full
retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of
adoption or a modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU
2014-09 by one year, and would allow entities the option to early
adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date.
This ASU is effective for public reporting companies for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company
has evaluated the adoption of the standard and due to the nature of
the Company’s oil and gas revenue agreements method there
will be no impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

80

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing”
(Topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net)”
(Topic 606). These amendments provide additional clarification and
implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The amendments
in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of
performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance
obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and
determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides
a customer with either a right to use an entity's intellectual
property or a right to access an entity's intellectual property.
The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify
the specified good or service for the principal versus agent
evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain
types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08
is to coincide with an entity's adoption of ASU 2014-09, which
would be adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017.   The Company has evaluated the
adoption of the standard and due to the nature of the
Company’s oil and gas revenue agreements method there will be
no impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a new lease standard
requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities
for most leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S.
GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company will
be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases
that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest
comparative period in the financial statements. The Company has
evaluated the adoption of the standard and, due to only one
operating lease currently in place, there will be minimal impact of
the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock
Compensation” (Topic 718). The FASB issued this update
to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and
affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to
their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income
tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted.
  The Company adopted the standard as of January 1, 2017.
There was no impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU
2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a
retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which
case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as
of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated
financial statements.

In
November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows
explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts
generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15,
2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance
are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires
application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard.

The
Company does not expect the adoption of any recently issued
accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in
preparation of our financial statements.

Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts
Method. The successful efforts method of accounting is
used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under
this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and
facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties
are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when
incurred. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration
and evaluation assets pending determination of whether the wells
find proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are
the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and
costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include
consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions.

Exploratory wells
in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for
economic viability within one year of completion of drilling. The
related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is determined
that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise, the
related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties and
subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are found
to have economically viable reserves in areas where major capital
expenditure will be required before production can commence, the
related well costs remain capitalized only if additional drilling
is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise the related well costs
are expensed as dry holes.

Exploration and
evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition of
an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for in
accordance with the policy outlined above.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is
calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production
method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total
estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other
capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed
reserves.

Revenue Recognition. All revenue is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
service or sale is complete, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the
sale of crude oil. Revenue from crude oil sales is recognized
when the crude oil is delivered to the purchaser and collectability
is reasonably assured. We follow the “sales method” of
accounting for oil and natural gas revenue, which means we
recognize revenue on all natural gas or crude oil sold to
purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to
our ownership in the property. A receivable or liability is
recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a
specific property greater than our share of the expected remaining
proved reserves. If collection is uncertain, revenue is recognized
when cash is collected. We recognize reimbursements received from
third parties for out-of-pocket expenses incurred as service
revenues and account for out-of-pocket expenses as direct
costs.

Stock-Based Compensation. Pursuant
to the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock
Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments
exchanged for employee service, we utilize the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option
awards at the date of grant, which requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected
life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect
the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based
compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally
require significant analysis and judgment to develop. When
estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or
determined from, external data and other assumptions may be derived
from our historical experience with stock-based payment
arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical
experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and
circumstances. We estimate volatility by considering historical
stock volatility. We have opted to use the simplified method for
estimating expected term, which is equal to the midpoint between
the vesting period and the contractual term.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...
