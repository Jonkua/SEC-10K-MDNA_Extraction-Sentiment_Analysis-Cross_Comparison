ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
Overview of 2017 Results
The transformation of Chesapeake over the past four years has been significant and our progress continued in 2017. Our progress has been guided by our strategies of financial discipline, pursuing profitable and efficient growth from our captured resources, leveraging technology and our operational expertise to unlock additional domestic resources through exploration and development and optimizing our portfolio through business development. Our strategies have not changed through the price cycles of the past several years, and we believe our recent accomplishments and achievements in 2017 have made our company stronger. Highlights include the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• grew estimated proved reserves volumes by 16% in 2017, net of divestitures;

- ---------------------------------------------------
• improved cash flow from operations by $949 million;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• grew production by 3%, adjusted for asset sales, and met our targeted goal of reaching 100,000 barrels of average net oil production per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, a significant accomplishment representing 11% growth from our 2016 fourth quarter oil volumes;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• improved our cost structure by reducing our production, general and administrative, and gathering, processing and transportation expenses by $510 million, or 18%;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• generated approximately $1.3 billion in net proceeds from the disposition of certain non-core assets and other property sales;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• reduced outstanding secured term debt by approximately $1.3 billion, or 32%;

- --------------------------------------
• continued to reduce legal obligations;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• exchanged approximately 10.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $100 million of liquidation value of our preferred stock, eliminating approximately $6 million of annual dividend obligations; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• achieved company record health, safety and environmental performance by lowering total recordable incident rates to 0.045 and reducing reportable spills by 15% compared to 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Business and Industry Outlook
Over the past decade, the landscape of energy production has changed dramatically in the United States. Domestic energy production capabilities have increased the nation’s supply of both crude oil and natural gas, primarily driven by advances in technology, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques. As a result of this increase in domestic supply of crude oil and natural gas, commodity prices for these products are meaningfully lower than they were a decade ago, but may remain volatile for the foreseeable future. To this end, we will always strive to protect a portion of our projected cash flow through our commodity hedging program as we see appropriate.

As of February 22, 2018, including January and February derivative contracts that are settled, approximately 74% of our projected full year 2018 crude oil production was hedged through swaps and open collars at an average of $52.41 per barrel and approximately 68% of our projected full year 2018 natural gas production was hedged through swaps and collars at an average of $3.10 per mcf. Our crude oil hedges are below current 2018 NYMEX crude oil strip prices of approximately $60.00 per barrel, and our natural gas hedges currently sit in a profitable position, above current 2018 NYMEX natural gas strip prices of approximately $2.80 per mcf. While we cannot predict the future movements of commodity prices with complete accuracy, we believe it is prudent to protect a portion of our projected cash flow through hedging and plan to continue to do so in the future.
In 2018, our focus is concentrated on three strategic priorities:

- -------------------------------------
• reduce total debt by $2 - $3 billion;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increase net cash provided by operating activities to fund capital expenditures; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• improve margins through financial discipline and operating efficiencies.

With regard to our debt, we are committed to decreasing the amount of debt outstanding. To accomplish this objective, we intend to allocate our capital expenditures to the highest-return projects, deploy leading drilling and completion technology throughout our portfolio to profitably and efficiently grow, and divest additional large assets to strengthen our cost structure and our portfolio. Increasing our margins means not only increasing our level of cash flow from operations, but also increasing our cash flow from operations generated per barrel of equivalent production. We are seeking to reduce cash costs (production, general and administrative and gathering, processing and transportation expenses), improve our production volumes from existing wells, and achieve additional operating and capital efficiencies with a focus on growing our oil volumes. Finally, we seek to maintain our high level of health, safety, and environmental performance and stewardship.
We have already made significant progress towards achieving our strategic priorities to date in 2018. So far we have:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• signed agreements for the sale of properties in the Mid-Continent, including our Mississippian Lime assets, for an expected aggregate amount of approximately $500 million in proceeds that we expect to close by the end of the 2018 second quarter; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• received net proceeds of approximately $74 million from the sale of approximately 4.3 million shares of FTS International, Inc. (NYSE: FTSI). After the sale, we own approximately 22 million shares of FTSI.

The proceeds from these divestitures will be used to repay debt and fund our development program, based on market conditions.
Over the last four years, we have fundamentally transformed substantially all aspects of our business, removing financial and operational complexity, significantly improving our balance sheet and addressing numerous legacy issues. Our 2018 capital expenditures program, while planned to be approximately 12% lower than our 2017 program, is expected to generate greater capital efficiency as we focus on expanding our margins by investing in the highest-return projects. In January, we reduced our workforce by approximately 13% as part of an overall plan to reduce costs and better align our workforce to the needs of our business. We are committed to reducing our debt and improving cash flow from operations, and believe we can make material advances in both of these areas in 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Overview
Our ability to grow, make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell. Substantial expenditures are required to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been very volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The substantial decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices from 2014 levels has negatively, and will continue to have, affected the amount of cash we generate and have available for capital expenditures and debt service and has had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and on the quantities of reserves that we can economically produce. Other risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, access to capital markets, regulatory risks, our ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements and the availability of lenders’ commitments as a result of regulatory pressures in the lending market.
As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of $5 million compared to $882 million as of December 31, 2016, and we had a net working capital deficit of $831 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to a net working capital deficit of $1.506 billion as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had total principal debt of $9.981 billion, compared to $9.989 billion as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.888 billion of borrowing capacity available under our senior secured revolving credit facility, with outstanding borrowings of $781 million and $116 million utilized for various letters of credit. Based on our cash balance, forecasted cash flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures, meet our debt service requirements and fund our other commitments and obligations for the next 12 months. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our notes.
Even though we have taken measures to mitigate the liquidity concerns facing us for the next 12 months, as outlined above in Overview of 2017 Results and Business and Industry Outlook, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient for periods beyond the next 12 months. If needed, we may seek to access the capital markets or otherwise refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness to improve our liquidity. We closely monitor the amounts and timing of our sources and uses of funds, particularly as they affect our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our ability to generate operating cash flow in the current commodity price environment, sell assets, access capital markets or take any other action to improve our liquidity and manage our debt is subject to the risks discussed above and the other risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time or control.
Capital Expenditures
We have significant control and flexibility over the timing and execution of our development plan, enabling us to reduce our capital spending as needed. Our forecasted 2018 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are $2.0 – $2.4 billion compared to our 2017 capital spending level of $2.5 billion. Management continues to review operational plans for 2018 and beyond, which could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and projected revenues from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL.
We may continue to use a combination of cash, borrowings and issuances of our common stock or other securities to retire our outstanding debt and/or preferred stock through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, tender offers or otherwise, but we are under no obligation to do so.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Derivative and Hedging Activities
Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs, allow us to predict with greater certainty the total revenue we will receive.
We utilize various oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments to protect a portion of our cash flow against downside risk. As of February 22, 2018, we have downside price protection in 2018 and 2019 through the following oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments:

See Notes 11 and 19, respectively, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for more information on our derivatives and asset retirement obligations. This table also does not include our costs to produce reserves attributable to non-expense-bearing royalty and other interests in our properties, including VPPs, which are discussed in Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Credit Risk
Derivative instruments that enable us to manage our exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL prices expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts only with counterparties that we deem to have acceptable credit strength and are deemed by management to be competent and competitive market-makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of December 31, 2017, our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments were spread among 11 counterparties. Additionally, the counterparties under these arrangements are required to secure their obligations in excess of defined thresholds.
Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil, natural gas and NGL ($959 million as of December 31, 2017) and exploration and production companies that own interests in properties we operate ($209 million as of December 31, 2017). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties deemed to have sub-standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $9 million, $10 million and $4 million, respectively, of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Some of our counterparties have requested or required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as gathering, processing, transportation and hedging agreements. As of February 20, 2018, we have received requests and posted approximately $151 million of collateral related to certain of our marketing and other contracts. We may be requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral in an aggregate amount of approximately $486 million, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit, cash or other acceptable collateral. However, we have substantial long-term business relationships with each of these counterparties, and we may be able to mitigate any collateral requests through ongoing business arrangements and by offsetting amounts that the counterparty owes us. Any posting of collateral consisting of cash or letters of credit reduces availability under our revolving credit facility and negatively impacts our liquidity.
Sources of Funds
The following table presents the sources of our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of divestitures of oil and natural gas assets.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $745 million in 2017 compared to cash used in operating activities of $204 million in 2016 and cash provided by operating activities of $1.234 billion in 2015. The increase in 2017 is primarily the result of higher prices for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sold and decreases in certain of our operating expenses, partially offset by lower volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL sold, the payment related to the litigation involving the early redemption of our 6.775% Senior Notes due 2019 and payments for terminations of transportation contracts. The decrease from 2015 is primarily the result of lower prices for the oil and natural gas we sold, lower volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL sold, less gain from our commodity derivatives, partially offset by decreases in certain of our operating expenses. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding various non-cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, certain impairments, gains or losses on sales of fixed assets, deferred income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our derivative instruments. See further discussion below under Results of Operations.
Revolving Credit Facility
We have a senior secured revolving credit facility currently subject to a $3.8 billion borrowing base that matures in December 2019. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.888 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for the second quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $781 million under the revolving credit facility and had used $116 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable rate. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the terms of the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the credit agreement. Our first lien secured leverage ratio was approximately 0.52 to 1.00, our interest coverage ratio was approximately 2.51 to 1.00 and our debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 0.38 to 1.00.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We currently plan to use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures for 2018. We expect to generate additional liquidity with proceeds from future sales of assets that do not fit our strategic priorities. Under our revolving credit facility, we borrowed $7.771 billion and repaid $6.990 billion in 2017, we borrowed and repaid $5.146 billion in 2016 and we had no borrowings or repayments in 2015.
Debt issuances

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Oil and Natural Gas Expenditures
Our drilling and completion costs increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased drilling and completion activity as well as higher service and supply costs. During 2017, our average operated rig count was 17 rigs compared to an average operated rig count of ten rigs in 2016 and we completed 401 operated wells in 2017 compared to 382 in 2016. Our acquisitions of proved and unproved properties were higher in 2016 compared to 2017 and 2015, primarily resulting from purchases of oil and natural gas interests previously sold to third parties in connection with five of our VPP transactions for approximately $387 million.
Repurchase of Debt
In 2017, we used $2.592 billion of cash to repurchase $2.389 billion principal amount of debt. In 2016, we used $2.734 billion of cash to repurchase $2.884 billion principal amount of debt. In 2015, we used $508 million of cash to repurchase $513 million principal amount of debt.
Dividends
We paid dividends of $183 million on our preferred stock during 2017, including $92 million of dividends in arrears that had been suspended throughout 2016. We did not pay dividends on our preferred stock in 2016 and paid $171 million of preferred stock dividends in 2015. We paid dividends of $118 million on our common stock in 2015. We eliminated common stock dividends in the 2015 third quarter and do not anticipate paying any common stock dividends in the foreseeable future.

A change in oil, natural gas and NGL prices has a significant impact on our revenues and cash flows. Assuming our 2017 production levels and without considering the effect of derivatives, an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would have resulted in an increase or decrease in 2017 revenues and cash flows from operations of approximately $33 million and $31 million, respectively, an increase or decrease of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would have resulted in an increase or decrease in 2017 revenues and cash flows from operations of approximately $88 million and $87 million, respectively, and an increase or decrease of $1.00 per barrel of NGL sold would have resulted in an increase or decrease in 2017 revenues and cash flows from operations of approximately $21 million and $20 million, respectively.

2017 vs. 2016. The absolute and per unit decrease was the result of the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties in 2016, partially offset by increased workover costs in the Eagle Ford and increased water disposal costs in the Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent. Production expenses in 2017 and 2016 included approximately $19 million and $44 million associated with VPP production volumes. We anticipate a continued decrease in production expenses associated with VPP production volumes as the contractually scheduled volumes under our remaining VPP agreement decrease and operating efficiencies generally improve.
2016 vs. 2015. The absolute and per unit decrease was the result of a reduction in repairs and maintenance expense as well as operating efficiencies across most of our operating areas.

The 2017 increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in term loan interest expense and a decrease in capitalized interest as a result of lower average balances of unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The overall increase in interest expense is offset in part by a decrease in interest expense on senior notes due to the decrease in the average outstanding principal amount of senior notes. The 2016 decreases in capitalized interest resulted from lower average balances of unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The 2016 decrease in interest expense on senior notes is due to the decrease in the average outstanding principal amount of senior notes. The 2016 increase in the amortization of premium associated with troubled debt restructuring is due to a full year of amortization on our second lien notes. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our debt refinancing. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $2.11 per boe in 2017 compared to $1.18 per boe in 2016 and $1.30 per boe in 2015.

Impairment of Investments. In 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairments of investments of $119 million and $53 million, respectively. The 2016 amount consisted of an other-than-temporary impairment of our Sundrop investment. The 2015 amount consisted of an other-than-temporary impairment of our FTSI International, Inc. (FTSI) investment due to the extended decrease in the oil and natural gas pricing environment.
Gains (Losses) on Purchases or Exchanges of Debt. In 2017, we retired $2.389 billion principal amount of our outstanding senior notes, senior secured second lien notes and contingent convertible notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers, redemptions or repayment upon maturity for $2.592 billion, which included the maturity of our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017 and the corresponding cross currency swap. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $233 million associated with the repurchases and tender offers.
 In 2016, we used the proceeds from our term loan facility, convertible notes issuance and senior notes issuance, together with cash on hand, to purchase and retire $2.884 billion principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes through purchases in the open market, tender offers or repayment upon maturity for $2.734 billion. Additionally, we privately negotiated an exchange of approximately $577 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes for 109,351,707 common shares. We recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $236 million associated with the repurchases and exchanges.
In December 2015, we privately exchanged newly issued 8.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 for certain outstanding senior unsecured notes and contingent convertible notes. For certain of the notes exchanged, we are accounting for these exchanges as a trouble debt restructuring (TDR). For exchanges classified as TDR, if the future undiscounted cash flows of the newly issued debt are less than the net carrying value of the original debt, a gain is recorded for the difference and the carrying value of the newly issued debt is adjusted to the future undiscounted cash flow amount, with no interest expense recorded going forward. For the remaining TDR exchanges, where the future undiscounted cash flows are greater than the net carrying value of the original debt, no gain is recognized and a new effective interest rate is established. Accordingly, we recognized a gain of $304 million in our consolidated statement of operations. Direct costs incurred of $29 million related to the notes exchange were also recognized. Additionally, we purchased in the open market approximately $119 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.25% Senior Notes due 2016 for cash. We recorded a gain of approximately $5 million associated with this repurchase.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit). We recorded income tax expense of $2 million in 2017, and income tax benefits of $190 million and $4.463 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 0.2% in 2017 compared to 4.1% in 2016 and 23.4% in 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to the intraperiod tax allocation provisions under GAAP applicable to 2016 which are not applicable in 2017. Further, our effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of income tax expense (benefit).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions. The accounting estimates and assumptions we consider to be most significant to our financial statements are discussed below. Our management has discussed each critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. We follow the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not capitalize any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.
Under the full cost method, capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit-of-production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly.
We review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting prescribed by the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test,

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for oil and natural gas cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.
Two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and oil and natural gas prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and/or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. See Oil and Natural Gas Properties in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information on the full cost method of accounting.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their values, future production rates and future costs and expenses require significant estimation and assumption. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of data available and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, estimates of reserves may be revised based on actual production, results of subsequent exploration and development activities, recent commodity prices, operating costs and other factors. These revisions could materially affect our financial statements. The volatility of commodity prices results in increased uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. Changes in oil, natural gas or NGL prices could result in actual results differing significantly from our estimates. See Supplemental Disclosures About Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Producing Activities included in Item 8 of this report for further information.
Derivatives. We use commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to price fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Results of commodity derivative contracts are reflected in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivative contracts are reflected in interest expense.
One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to counterparty valuations for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. This non-performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. Additionally, in accordance with accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, to the extent that a legal right of set-off exists, we net the value of our derivative instruments with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our derivative instruments are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Due to the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, our financial condition and results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of our derivatives were net liabilities of $35 million and net liabilities of $577 million, respectively.
Income Taxes. The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations and application of complex rules and regulations pertaining to federal, state and local taxing jurisdictions. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method as required by GAAP. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets for NOL and tax credit carryforwards have also been recognized. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional valuation allowances or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider the weight of all available evidence, both positive and negative, concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are:

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

- -------------------------------------------
• taxable income projections in future years;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities against deferred tax assets and whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of the tax benefit;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.

Our judgments and assumptions in estimating future taxable income include such factors as future operating conditions and commodity prices when determining if deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred tax assets totaling $2.826 billion and $4.690 billion upon which we had a valuation allowance of $2.674 billion and $4.389 billion, respectively.
We also routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establish accruals for such positions. Accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions requires that a more-likely-than-not threshold condition be met on a tax position, based solely on its technical merits of being sustained, before any benefit of the uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de-recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. If a tax position does not meet or exceed the more-likely-than-not threshold then no benefit can be recorded.

(6) Interest rate swaps, settled upon the issuance of these notes in 2017, effectively set the interest rate on the $750 million notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.44%. Maturities of long-term debt during the fiscal years subsequent to November 30, 2018 are as follows (in millions): ---------- ------- ---- 2019 $ 77.1 2020 576.8 2021 326.8 2022 1,182.6 Thereafter 2,317.0 The consideration for our acquisition of RB Foods on August 17, 2017 totaled approximately $4.2 billion in cash (see note 2) and was funded with (a) borrowings under McCormick's $1.5 billion Term Loan Agreement described below; (b) amounts received from the offering of $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of McCormick's senior unsecured notes described below; and (c) amounts received from the offering of McCormick's common stock non-voting, which closed on August 11, 2017 (see note 13). In connection with our entry into the agreement to acquire RB Foods, we entered into a commitment letter, dated July 18, 2017 (the "Commitment Letter"), under which certain banks agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") of up to $4.2 billion in the aggregate. On August 7, 2017, we entered into a Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions under which those financial institutions agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") for the purpose of providing the financing necessary to fund all or a portion of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the acquisition of RB Foods and related fees and expenses (the "Bridge Loan Commitment"). The Bridge Facility provided that the Bridge Loan Commitment would be reduced in equivalent amounts upon any incurrence by McCormick of, among other things, term loans and/or the issuance of equity or notes in a public offering or private placement prior to the consummation of the transaction, subject to certain exce...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...
