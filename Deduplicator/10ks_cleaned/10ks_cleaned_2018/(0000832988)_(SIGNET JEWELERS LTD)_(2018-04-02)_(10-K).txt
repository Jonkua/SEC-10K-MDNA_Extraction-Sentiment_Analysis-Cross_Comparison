GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Signet which are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The following information should be read in conjunction with Signet’s financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8.
A number of non-GAAP measures are used by management to analyze and manage the performance of the business. See Item 6 for the required disclosures related to these measures. Signet provides such non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate its operations. The Company’s management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Exchange Translation Impact
The monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales. In Fiscal 2019, it is anticipated a five percent movement in the British pound to US dollar exchange rate would impact income before income taxes by approximately $2.0 million, while a five percent movement in the Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate would have a negligible impact on income before income taxes.
Fiscal 2018 Overview
Similar to many other retailers, Signet follows the retail 4-4-5 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 (the “53rd week”). The 53rd week added $84.3 million in net sales and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.12 for both the quarter and Fiscal 2018.
Same store sales decreased 5.3% compared to a decrease of 1.9% in Fiscal 2017; total sales were down 2.4% to $6.3 billion compared to $6.4 billion in Fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 9.3% compared to 11.9% in Fiscal 2017. Operating income decreased 24.0% to $579.9 million compared to $763.2 million in Fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share increased 5.1% to $7.44 compared to $7.08 in Fiscal 2017. Merchandise categories and collections were broadly lower, partially offset by e-commerce and Piercing Pagoda total sales increases.

Signet’s long-term debt was $688.2 million at February 3, 2018 and $1.3 billion at January 28, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $225.1 million and $98.7 million, as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively. During Fiscal 2018, Signet repurchased 8.1 million shares, which represented approximately 12% of the common shares outstanding, at an average cost of $56.91 per share.
Drivers of Operating Profitability
The key measures and drivers of operating profitability are:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• total sales - driven by the change in same store sales and net store selling space;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• gross margin - including the mix of results by store banner including brick-and-mortar locations and online;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• level of selling, general and administrative expenses; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other operating income, which primarily consists of finance income from the Company’s credit operations.

Same Store Sales
Same store sales growth is calculated by comparison of sales in stores that were open in both the current and the prior fiscal year. Sales from stores that have been open for less than 12 months, are excluded from the comparison until their 12-month anniversary. Sales after the 12-month anniversary are compared against the equivalent prior period sales within the comparable store sales comparison. Stores closed in the current financial period are included up to the date of closure and the comparative period is correspondingly adjusted. Stores that have been relocated or expanded, but remain within the same local geographic area, are included within the comparison with no adjustment to either the current or comparative period. Stores that have been refurbished are also included within the comparison except for the period when the refurbishment was taking place, when those stores are excluded from the comparison both for the current year and for the comparative period. Sales to employees are also excluded. Comparisons at divisional level are made in local currency and consolidated comparisons are made at constant exchange rates and exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the weighted average exchange rate for the current period. E-commerce sales are included in the calculation of same store sales for the period and the comparative figures from the anniversary of the launch of the relevant website. Same store sales exclude the 53rd week in the fiscal year in which it occurs. Management considers same store sales useful as it is a major benchmark used by investors to judge performance within the retail industry.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales is mostly composed of merchandise costs (net of discounts and allowances). Cost of sales also contains:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Occupancy costs such as rent, common area maintenance, depreciation and real estate tax.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net bad debt expense and customers’ late payments primarily under the in-house customer finance program.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Store operating expenses such as utilities, displays and merchant credit costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Distribution and warehousing costs including freight, processing, inventory shrinkage and related payroll.

As the classification of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have in-house customer finance programs, Signet’s gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers.

Table of Contents

Factors that influence gross margin include pricing, changes in merchandise costs (principally diamonds), changes in non-merchandise components of cost of sales (as described above), changes in sales mix, foreign exchange, gold and currency hedges and the economics of services such as repairs and extended service plans. The price of diamonds varies depending on their size, cut, color and clarity. At times, Signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to the US dollar exchange rate, but it is not able to do so for diamonds. For gold and currencies, the hedging period can extend to 24 months, although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of 12 months.
The percentage mix of the merchandise cost component of cost of sales, based on US dollars, is as follows:

----------- -------------------------- - ------------- -- ------------------- ----------- - -- -

 Sterling Jewelers division Zale division UK Jewelry division TotalSignet
Fiscal 2018
Diamonds 54 % 35 % 16 % 45 %
Gold 13 % 15 % 15 % 14 %
All Other 33 % 50 % 69 % 41 %
Fiscal 2017
Diamonds 54 % 36 % 16 % 45 %
Gold 14 % 14 % 15 % 14 %
All Other 32 % 50 % 69 % 41 %

Signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and, as jewelry inventory turns slowly, the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes time to be fully reflected in the gross margin. Signet’s inventory turns faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters, therefore, changes in the cost of merchandise is more impactful on the gross margin in that quarter. Furthermore, Signet’s hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin. An increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross margin.
Accounts receivable comprise a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance. The net bad debt expense includes an estimate of the allowance for losses as of the balance sheet date. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company began measuring delinquency under the contractual basis which aligns with the processes and collection strategies utilized by the Company’s third party credit service provider for the remaining in-house finance receivable portfolio beginning in October 2017. Under this measure of delinquency, credit card accounts are considered delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date. The aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer has failed to make a minimum payment. Management utilizes the delinquency rates identified within the portfolio when calculating the overall allowance for the portfolio.
The overall allowance continues to be based on the Company’s historical loss experience and payment performance information for accounts with similar credit quality characteristics as the remaining portfolio since the inception of the in-house consumer financing program, which was operated under the Company’s aging and collection methodologies in place prior to October 2017. As a result of the credit transaction disclosed in Note 3 of Item 8, the aging and collection methodologies have been revised to align with contractual method, which may result in different customer payment behaviors. A 100% allowance is made for accounts associated with bankrupt or deceased cardholders, as well as for accounts more than 120 days past due on the contractual basis. The Company’s policy for charging off uncollectible receivables is 180 days.
A small portion of sales under the Zale banners are financed through our in-house customer programs but represent an immaterial amount of the Company’s credit sales, receivable balance, and bad debt expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense (“SGA”)
SGA expense primarily includes store staff and store administrative costs as well as advertising and promotional costs. It also includes field support center expenses such as information technology, in-house credit operations prior to the Company’s outsourcing initiatives and third-party servicing of receivables subsequent to the outsourcing initiative, finance, e-commerce and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statements.
The primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees and the level of compensation, taxes and other benefits paid. Management varies, on a store by store basis, the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity, subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store. Non-store staffing levels are less variable. A significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales and operating profit.
The level of advertising expenditure can vary. The largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by management’s judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media.

Other Operating Income
Other operating income is predominantly interest income arising from in-house customer finance provided to the customers of the Sterling Jewelers division. Its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged, the credit program selected by the customer and the level of outstanding balances. The level of outstanding balances is primarily dependent on the sales of the Sterling Jewelers division, the proportion of sales that use the in-house customer finance, as well as program mix and the monthly collection rate.
In October 2017, Signet, through its subsidiary Sterling Jewelers Inc., completed the sale of the prime-only credit quality portion of Sterling’s in-house finance receivable portfolio to Comenity. In addition, during March 2018, the Company announced that it entered a definitive agreement with CarVal Investors to sell all eligible non-prime in-house accounts receivable. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company expects a material reduction in the amount of interest income it recognizes. See Note 3 in Item 8 for further detail on the Company’s credit transactions.
Operating Income
To maintain current levels of operating income, Signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin, any increase in operating costs, and any adverse changes in other operating income. Same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income. Slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income. When foreseen, Signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth. A key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store, with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses.

COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2018 TO FISCAL 2017

- ----------------------------
• Same store sales: down 5.3%.

- ---------------------------------------------
• Diluted earnings per share: up 5.1% to $7.44.

In Fiscal 2018, Signet’s same store sales, which excluded the impact of the 53rd week from its calculation, decreased by 5.3%, compared to a decrease of 1.9% in Fiscal 2017.

Sterling Jewelers sales
In Fiscal 2018, Sterling Jewelers total sales were $3,820.5 million, down 2.8%, compared to $3,930.4 million in Fiscal 2017, and same store sales decreased 7.0% compared to a decrease of 2.6% in Fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 sales were driven by weakness in bridal in Kay and Jared, including lower year over year sales of the Ever Us collection. The decrease in bridal was disproportionately affected by systems and process disruptions associated with the outsourcing of credit services. Sterling Jewelers’ average merchandise transaction value (“ATV”) increased 3.1%, while the number of transactions decreased 10.9%. These results were driven by relatively stronger sales of higher-priced diamond jewelry collections.

Same store sales decreased 1.2% compared to a decrease of 1.2% in Fiscal 2017. Sales reflected strength in diamond fashion jewelry, most notably in the Disney Enchanted and Vera Wang Love collections offset by weakness in bridal and beads which helped drive an ATV increase of 3.2%. Piercing Pagoda ATV increased 8.6%, while the number of transactions decreased 5.0% due to improved performance of gold fashion jewelery.

UK Jewelry sales
In Fiscal 2018, the UK Jewelry division’s total sales were $616.7 million, down 4.7%, compared to $647.1 million in Fiscal 2017. Sales declines were due principally to bridal and diamond fashion jewelry partially offset by higher sales in select prestige watch brands and strength in e-commerce. Same store sales decreased by 6.0% compared to an increase of 0.1% in Fiscal 2017. ATV increased 9.7%, offset by a 14.7% decrease in the number of transactions.

Fourth Quarter Sales
In the fourth quarter, Signet’s total sales were $2,293.1 million, down $23.2 million or 1.0%, compared to a decrease of 5.1% in the prior year fourth quarter. Same store sales were down 5.2% compared to a decrease of 4.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. The total sales increase was driven by the 14th week in sales, which contributed $84.3 million of sales, as well as the addition of R2Net which contributed $64.4 million in sales in the quarter, offset by the year-over-year decline in base same store sales.

Sterling Jewelers sales
In the fourth quarter, the Sterling Jewelers division’s total sales were $1,382.7 million compared to $1,398.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter, a decline of 1.1%. Same store sales decreased 8.6%, compared to a decrease of 4.9% in the prior year fourth quarter. Approximately 500 bps of the same store sales decline was a result of the credit outsourcing transition, most notably in sales of bridal merchandise. While both Kay and Jared experienced issues related to the credit transition, impacts were more pronounced at Kay, where a greater percentage of customers utilize in-store credit for bridal purchases. In addition to credit transition issues, Sterling sales were driven by less effective promotional spending and lower sales of the Ever Us collection partially offset by the success of the Chosen collection at Jared. Sterling Jewelers’ ATV increased 1.7% and the number of transactions decreased 12.8%. ATV increased driven by mix with particular strength in higher-value diamond jewelry.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
In Fiscal 2018, gross margin was $2,190.0 million or 35.0% of sales compared to $2,360.8 million or 36.8% of sales in Fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin dollars was attributable to a decline in the gross merchandise margin rate and de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Sterling Jewelers division gross margin dollars decreased $138.2 million compared to Fiscal 2017, reflecting gross margin rate decrease of 250 basis points, of which 50 basis points is attributable to the inclusion of R2Net. In addition to the impact of R2Net, the decline in gross margin was due to the de-leverage on fixed costs and higher costs associated with disposition of inventory in part due to distribution center consolidation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the Zale division, gross margin dollars decreased $12.7 million compared to Fiscal 2017 and the rate declined 40 basis points, primarily attributable to de-leverage on store occupancy costs. This was offset by an increase in the gross merchandise margin rate primarily due to merchandise mix.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the UK Jewelry division, gross margin dollars decreased $19.7 million compared to Fiscal 2017, reflecting gross margin rate decrease of 170 basis points. The decreases in dollars and rate were driven principally by lower sales volumes, a decline in the gross merchandise margin rate due to promotions and mix and de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

In the fourth quarter, the consolidated gross margin was $919.8 million or 40.1% of sales compared to $945.5 million or 41.7% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The declines in the consolidated gross margin was driven principally by a negative 70 basis point impact related to R2Net, which carries a lower gross margin rate, lower sales, leading to de-leverage on fixed costs and merchandise mix.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Sterling Jewelers gross margin decreased $36.7 million. The gross margin rate declined 220 basis points, of which 120 basis points is attributed to the inclusion of R2Net. The remainder of the rate decline is primarily due to de-leverage of fixed costs offset in part by a higher gross merchandise margin rate. Net bad debt expense had no material impact on the gross margin rate.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Zale Division gross margin increased by $14.0 million. The gross margin rate decreased by 10 basis points, driven primarily by higher sales leading to leverage on fixed costs, partially offset by a decline in gross merchandise margin rate due to merchandise mix.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross margin dollars in the UK Jewelry Division decreased $3.3 million. The gross margin rate declined by 240 basis points due to lower sales leading to de-leverage on fixed costs.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2018 were $1,872.2 million or 29.9% of sales compared to $1,880.2 million or 29.3% of sales in Fiscal 2017, down $8.0 million. The decrease was attributable to decreased store staff costs and advertising expense partially offset by increased central costs. The increase in central costs was primarily driven by the inclusion of the 53rd week which added $30.5 million of expense, an additional $16.2 million of selling, general and administrative expense related to R2Net and other one-time costs of $12.0 million related to CEO separation and the R2Net acquisition.
In the fourth quarter, SGA expense was $634.5 million or 27.7% of sales compared to $615.3 million or 27.1% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The increase in expense was primarily driven by the inclusion of the 14th week in the quarter which added $30.5 million of expense and credit outsourcing costs of $21.0 million partially offset by savings of $25.0 million related to in-house credit operations, as well as lower advertising expense and store labor costs.
Other Operating Income, Net
In Fiscal 2018, other operating income, net was $260.8 million or 4.2% of sales compared to $282.6 million or 4.4% of sales in Fiscal 2017. In the fourth quarter, other operating income, net was $39.5 million or 1.7% of sales compared to $69.0 million or 3.0% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to the 53rd week which added $1.3 million of other income offset by $28.0 million in other expense related to the sale of the prime-only credit quality portion of Sterling’s in-house finance receivable portfolio during the third quarter of Fiscal 2018.

Operating Income
In Fiscal 2018, operating income was $579.9 million or 9.3% of sales compared to $763.2 million or 11.9% of sales in Fiscal 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales volumes and the impact of the credit outsourcing transaction during the third quarter of Fiscal 2018.

In the fourth quarter, operating income was $323.5 million or 14.1% of sales compared to $399.2 million or 17.6% of sales in prior year fourth quarter. The decline was driven by de-leverage of fixed costs due to sales declines, the impact of the credit outsourcing transaction and de-leverage related to R2Net, which carries a lower operating margin rate. The credit outsourcing transaction (excluding the sales impact of credit transition) reduced operating income by $21.0 million in the quarter primarily due to the loss of interest income.

Interest Expense, Net
In Fiscal 2018, net interest expense was $52.7 million compared to $49.4 million in Fiscal 2017. The weighted average interest rate for the Company’s debt outstanding was 3.2% compared to 2.8% in the prior year. The increase in expense relates to additional interest incurred under the unsecured term loan entered into by Signet to finance the R2Net acquisition transaction (the “bridge loan”), partially offset by a reduction in interest related to the settlement of the Company’s asset-backed securitization facility, which was terminated in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018. See Item 8 for additional information related to the loans and long-term debt (Note 21).
In the fourth quarter, net interest expense was $10.0 million compared to $13.0 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The weighted average interest rate for the Company’s debt outstanding was 3.6% compared to 2.9% in the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease in expense relates to a reduction in interest related to the settlement of the Company’s asset-backed securitization facility, which was terminated in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018.
Income Before Income Taxes
In Fiscal 2018, income before income taxes decreased $186.6 million to $527.2 million or 8.4% of sales compared to $713.8 million or 11.1% of sales in Fiscal 2017.
In the fourth quarter, income before income taxes decreased $72.7 million to $313.5 million or 13.7% of sales compared to $386.2 million or 17.0% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense for Fiscal 2018 was $7.9 million compared to $170.6 million in Fiscal 2017, with an effective tax rate of 1.5% for Fiscal 2018 compared to 23.9% in Fiscal 2017. In the fourth quarter, income tax benefit was $37.8 million compared to expense of $88.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The lower effective tax rate in Fiscal 2018 was driven principally by the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States and the pre-tax earnings mix by jurisdiction. Revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a one-time non-cash benefit of $64.7 million in the quarter.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted “An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,” which is commonly referred to as “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJ Act”). The TCJ Act provides for comprehensive tax legislation which significantly modifies the U.S. corporate income tax system. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJ Act, we have made reasonable estimates of its effects and recorded provisional amounts for the year ended February 3, 2018, consistent with applicable SEC guidance.
The results for the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2018 include a net benefit of $86.2 million related to provisional estimates resulting directly from the TCJ Act. Within our calculations of the income tax effects of the TCJ Act, we used assumptions and estimates that may change as a result of future guidance and interpretation from the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and/or various other taxing jurisdictions. In particular, we anticipate that the U.S. state jurisdictions will continue to determine and announce their conformity or decoupling from the Act, either in its entirety or with respect to specific provisions. All of these potential legislative and interpretive actions could result in adjustments to any of the provisional estimates when the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJ Act is completed.
We anticipate that the effective tax rate in 2019 and in future years will be favorably impacted by the lower federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21.0 percent offset by limitations of certain deductions and the base broadening changes. See Note 10 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes and the impact of the TCJ Act.
Net Income
Net income for Fiscal 2018 was down 4.4% to $519.3 million or 8.3% of sales compared to $543.2 million or 8.5% of sales in Fiscal 2017.
For the fourth quarter, net income was up 18.1% to $351.3 million or 15.3% of sales compared to $297.5 million or 13.1% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter.
Earnings per Share
For Fiscal 2018, diluted earnings per share were $7.44 compared to $7.08 in Fiscal 2017, an increase of 5.1%. Earnings per share in Fiscal 2018 includes $0.93 related to the impact of revaluation on deferred taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The weighted average diluted number of common shares outstanding was 69.8 million compared to 76.7 million in Fiscal 2017. Signet repurchased 8.1 million shares in Fiscal 2018 compared to 11.2 million shares in Fiscal 2017.
For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.24 compared to $3.92 in the prior year fourth quarter, up 33.7%. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 includes $0.96 related to the impact of revaluation on deferred taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The weighted average diluted number of common shares outstanding was 67.0 million compared to 75.8 million in the prior year fourth quarter.
The Company issued preferred shares on October 5, 2016, which include a cumulative dividend right and may be converted into common shares. The Company’s computation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of potential common shares for outstanding awards issued under the Company’s share-based compensation plans and preferred shares upon conversion, if dilutive. In computing diluted EPS, the Company also adjusts the numerator used in the basic EPS computation, subject to anti-dilution requirements, to add back the dividends (declared or cumulative undeclared) applicable to the preferred shares. For the fourth quarter and year to date periods, the preferred shares were more dilutive if conversion was assumed. See Item 8 for additional information related to the preferred shares (Note 6) or the calculation of earnings per share (Note 8).
Dividends per Common Share
In Fiscal 2018, dividends of $1.24 were declared by the Board of Directors compared to $1.04 in Fiscal 2017.

Sterling Jewelers sales
In Fiscal 2017, Sterling Jewelers total sales were $3,930.4 million, down 1.5%, compared to $3,988.7 million in Fiscal 2016, and same store sales decreased 2.6% compared to an increase of 3.7% in Fiscal 2016. Sales performance was led by fashion jewelry such as Ever Us and non-branded earrings and bracelets. Bridal performance was led by Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane, the newly introduced Chosen assortment, and non-branded rings. The average merchandise transaction value (“ATV”) increased driven by mix with particular strength in higher-value diamond jewelry, coupled with declines in select lower average selling price point collections such as Charmed Memories and watches. The number of merchandise transactions decreased due to the same dynamic. Mix of merchandise increased toward higher-value, less-transactional collections (e.g. Ever Us) in lieu of higher-transactional, lower-value collections (e.g. Charmed Memories).

Zale division sales
The Zale division’s Fiscal 2017 sales were $1,812.8 million compared to $1,811.4 million in Fiscal 2016. Zale Jewelry contributed $1,549.7 million and Piercing Pagoda contributed $263.1 million of revenues, compared to $1,568.2 million and $243.2 million, respectively, in the prior year. Total Zale division sales included purchase accounting adjustments of $13.3 million and $27.2 million in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, related to a reduction of deferred revenue associated with extended warranty sales. Same store sales decreased 1.2% compared to an increase of 4.8% in Fiscal 2016. Zale sales growth was led by diamond fashion jewelry such as Ever Us and Endless Brilliance. This was offset by a decline in select bridal collections, solitaires, and loose diamond sales. Zale division ATV increased 5.3%, while the number of transactions decreased 5.8%. Zale had greater sales productivity in higher-value, lower-transactional collections (e.g. Vera Wang Fashion, Ever Us). Piercing Pagoda ATV increased 13.7%, while the number of transactions decreased 6.2% due to merchandise mix toward higher priced gold and diamond assortments.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
In Fiscal 2017, gross margin was $2,360.8 million or 36.8% of sales compared to $2,440.4 million or 37.3% of sales in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross margin dollars was attributable to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and de-leverage on store occupancy costs, offset in part by decreased effect of purchase accounting adjustments of $11.3 million compared to $35.6 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Sterling Jewelers division gross margin dollars decreased $64.0 million compared to Fiscal 2016, reflecting decreased sales and a decline in the gross margin rate of 100 basis points due to higher bad debt expense and de-leverage on store occupancy costs. Gross merchandise margin rate was flat to prior year.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the Zale division, gross margin dollars increased $24.0 million compared to Fiscal 2016, primarily attributable to the decreased effect of purchase accounting adjustments which totaled $11.3 million in Fiscal 2017 and $35.6 million in the prior year. The gross margin rate increased 120 basis points reflecting higher merchandise margins offset in part by de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

• In the UK Jewelry division, gross margin dollars decreased $39.5 million compared to Fiscal 2016, reflecting gross margin rate decrease of 170 basis points. The decreases in dollars and rate were driven principally by lower sales, de-leverage on store occupancy, a 90 basis point decline in the gross merchandise margin rate, including the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.

In the fourth quarter, the consolidated gross margin was $945.5 million or 41.7% of sales compared to $1,016.0 million or 42.5% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. Included in gross margin were purchase accounting adjustments totaling $1.6 million compared to $4.7 million in prior year fourth quarter. The decline in consolidated gross margin was driven principally by lower sales leading to de-leverage on fixed costs as well as incremental promotional activity resulting in a flat merchandise margin rate to last year.
The decline in gross margin was driven principally by lower sales leading to de-leverage on fixed costs as well as more promotional activity.

• Gross margin dollars in the Sterling Jewelers division decreased $41.2 million compared to prior year fourth quarter, while the gross margin rate decreased 120 basis points due primarily to lower sales which de-leveraged fixed costs, such as store occupancy. In addition, higher bad debt expense and incremental promotional activity unfavorably impacted the gross margin rate.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the Zale division, gross margin dollars decreased $2.3 million compared to prior year fourth quarter. Included in gross margin were purchase accounting adjustments totaling $1.6 million compared to $4.7 million in prior year fourth quarter. The gross margin rate increased 70 basis points reflecting higher merchandise margins offset in part by de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

• In the UK Jewelry division, gross margin dollars decreased $26.6 million compared to Fiscal 2016, while the gross margin rate decreased 220 basis points driven principally by de-leverage on lower sales and lower merchandise margins due to increased promotional activity.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2017 were $1,880.2 million or 29.3% of sales compared to $1,987.6 million or 30.4% of sales in Fiscal 2016, down $107.4 million. The decrease was attributable to lower variable compensation costs due to lower sales and a reduction in integration costs primarily as a result of the $34.2 million appraisal settlement in the prior year. Included in SGA were unfavorable purchase accounting adjustments of $5.5 million and integration costs of $28.4 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to favorable purchase accounting adjustments of $9.2 million and transaction and integration costs of $78.9 million in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in dollars and rate was driven primarily by lower variable compensation due to lower sales, lower advertising expense, merchant fee savings in Zale credit programs and favorable foreign exchange translation, offset in part by higher information technology (“IT”) expense associated with Signet’s IT modernization roadmap.
In the fourth quarter, SGA expense was $615.3 million or 27.1% of sales compared to $686.6 million or 28.7% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease was attributable to lower variable compensation costs due to lower sales and a reduction in integration costs including consulting costs incurred in connection with the Zale integration, severance related to organizational changes and expenses associated with the settlement of miscellaneous legal matters pending as of the date of the Zale acquisition. Included in SGA were unfavorable purchase accounting adjustments of $1.6 million and integration costs of $9.9 million compared to unfavorable purchase accounting adjustments of $1.5 million and integration costs of $19.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The 120 basis point decrease in SGA rate was driven primarily by lower variable compensation including short-term and long-term incentive compensation, impact of synergies, lower advertising expense, merchant fee savings in Zale credit programs and foreign exchange translation. Offsetting these items was higher IT expense associated with Signet’s IT modernization roadmap.
Other Operating Income, Net
In Fiscal 2017, other operating income, net was $282.6 million or 4.4% of sales compared to $250.9 million or 3.8% of sales in Fiscal 2016. In the fourth quarter, other operating income, net was $69.0 million or 3.0% of sales compared to $63.7 million or 2.6% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities
Signet derives most of its operating cash from net income through the sale of jewelry. As a retail business, Signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by Signet or the relevant bank if the payment is made by third-party credit or debit card. Partially offsetting cash receipts via sales are payments of operating expenses. Signet’s largest operating expenses are cost of inventory along with payroll and payroll-related benefits.
Working Capital
Changes to accounts receivable are driven by the Sterling Jewelers division in-house credit program. If a customer makes use of financing provided by the Sterling Jewelers division, the cash is received over time based on terms of the agreement. In October 2017, Signet, through its subsidiary Sterling Jewelers Inc., completed with CarVal Investors to sell all eligible non-prime in-house accounts receivable. Upon completion of the transaction announced in March 2018, the working capital requirements for Signet are expected to decrease materially as there will no longer be an in-house credit program funded by the Company.
In Fiscal 2018, 57.9% of the Sterling Jewelers division’s sales were made using customer financing provided by Signet, as compared to 62.0% in Fiscal 2017. The average monthly collection rate from the Sterling Jewelers customer in-house finance receivables was 9.7% as compared to 11.0% in Fiscal 2017. Changes in credit participation and the collection rate impact the level of receivables.
Changes to accounts payable are primarily driven by the timing and amount of merchandise purchased, the mix of merchandise purchased and the relevant payment terms. Signet typically pays for merchandise within 30 days of receipt. Due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry, it is usual for inventory to turnover on average once approximately every 12 months.
Signet’s working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales, and movements in the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate. The working capital needs of the business normally decline from January to August, as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks. As inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter, there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid- to late-November. The peak level of working capital is typically $100 million to $150 million above the typical January to August level, and can be accentuated by new store openings. The working capital position then reverses over the Holiday Season.
The change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores, the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales. Other factors which drive changes to inventory include changes in sourcing practices, commodity costs, foreign exchange and merchandise mix. To further enhance product selection, test new jewelry designs and working capital levels, Signet enters into consignment arrangements for merchandise. The majority of inventory held on consignment is in the US, which at February 3, 2018 amounted to $606.4 million as compared to $574.0 million at January 28, 2017. The principal terms of the consignment agreements, which can generally be terminated by either party, are such that Signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties. When Signet sells consignment inventory, it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item. The sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis (see principal accounting policies, Item 8).
Signet’s working capital is also impacted by movements in deferred revenue associated with the sales of extended service plans sold in Sterling Jewelers and Zale divisions. Movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of divisional sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales. Therefore if sales increase, working capital would be expected to increase. Similarly, a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capital.
Signet’s largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits. These are typically paid on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis, with annual bonus payments also being made. Operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the Sterling Jewelers and Zale divisions and on a quarterly basis by the UK Jewelry division. Payment for advertising on television, radio or in print is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears. Other expenses, none of which are material, have various payment terms.
Investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital, as well as fixed capital investment, due to the inventory turn, and the additional investment required to fund sales in the Sterling Jewelers and Zale divisions utilizing in-house customer finance. Of the total investment required to open a new store in the US, between 50% and 60% is typically accounted for by working capital. New stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year. A reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower, while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact.

Fiscal 2018 Cash Flow Results
In Fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion as compared to $678.3 million in Fiscal 2017. The increase of $1.3 billion is primarily attributable to $952.5 million of proceeds from the sale of in-house finance receivables, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $30.9 million related to the sale, a $23.9 million decrease in net income and the following cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cash provided by accounts receivable was $242.1 million compared to a use of $102.7 million in Fiscal 2017. See the ‘Working Capital’ section above and Item 1 for a summary of key customer financing statistics related to the Sterling Jewelers customer in-house finance receivables. Additionally, see Note 3 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the sale of the prime portion of the in-house finance receivables.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cash provided by inventory and inventory-related items was $210.9 million compared to a use of $9.7 million in Fiscal 2017. The change in inventory cash flows is attributed to the change in total inventory on-hand to $2.3 billion in Fiscal 2018 compared to $2.4 billion in Fiscal 2017. Key factors impacting the decrease in total inventory were initiatives focused on reducing inventory levels offset by the effect of foreign exchange and higher commodity prices.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The decrease in income taxes payable was $82.4 million compared an increase of $38.9 million in Fiscal 2017. Cash outflow in Fiscal 2018 is attributable to lower taxable income as a result of the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States and lower pre-tax earnings. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also impacted the non-cash movement in deferred taxation which reflects an outflow of $33.4 million compared to an inflow of $27.7 million in Fiscal 2017.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the purchases of property, plant and equipment related to the:

- ----------------------------------
• rate of space expansion in the US;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• investment in existing stores, reflecting the level of investment in sales-enhancing technology, and the number of store remodels and relocations carried out; and

- ------------------------------------------------------
• investments in IT modernization and digital ecosystem.

When evaluating new store investment, management uses an investment hurdle rate of a 20% internal rate of return on a pre-tax basis over a five year period, assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years. Capital expenditure accounts for about 45% of the investment in a new store in the Sterling Jewelers division. The balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing. Signet typically carries out a remodel of its stores every 10 years but does have some discretion as to the timing of such expenditure. A remodel is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store. Minor store refurbishments are typically carried out every five years. In addition to store remodels, Signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full remodel; this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal. Where possible, the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities.
In Fiscal 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $569.4 million, compared to $278.4 million in Fiscal 2017 and $228.7 million in Fiscal 2016. The overall increase in capital additions was primarily due to the acquisition of R2Net as discussed in Note 4 of Item 8. Excluding the acquisition of R2Net in Fiscal 2018, cash used in each period was primarily for capital additions associated with new store locations and remodels of existing stores, as well as capital investments in IT. See table below for additional information regarding capital additions.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure, see Item 6) is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow in Fiscal 2018 was $1.7 billion compared to $400.3 million and $216.8 million in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively. The increase in free cash flow in Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the proceeds on the sale of a portion of the Company’s in-house finance receivables (see Note 3 of item 8 and ‘Working Capital’ section above).
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
The major items within financing activities are discussed below:
Proceeds from issuance of equity shares
On October 5, 2016, the Company issued 625,000 preferred shares to Green Equity Investors VI, L.P., Green Equity Investors Side VI, L.P., LGP Associates VI-A LLC and LGP Associates VI-B LLC, all affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., (together, the “Investors”) for an aggregate purchase price of $625.0 million, or $1,000 per share (the “Stated Value”) pursuant to the investment agreement dated August 24, 2016. In connection with the issuance of the preferred shares, the Company incurred direct and incremental expenses of $13.7 million, including financial advisory fees, closing costs, legal expenses and other offering-related expenses. The preferred shares rank senior to the Company’s common shares, with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. Preferred shareholders are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on February 15, 2017. See Note 6 of Item 8 for additional information related to preferred shareholder rights.
In addition, $0.3 million was received in Fiscal 2018 from the issuance of common shares as compared to $2.1 million in Fiscal 2017. Other than equity based compensation awards granted to employees, Signet has not issued common shares as a financing activity for more than 10 years.

Restrictions on dividend payments
Signet has a senior unsecured multi-currency, multi-year revolving credit facility agreement (the “Credit Facility”) which provides the Company with a $700.0 million revolving credit facility and a $357.5 million term loan facility. This credit facility agreement permits the making of dividend payments and stock repurchases so long as the Parent Company (i) is not in default under the agreement, or (ii) if in default at the time of making such dividend repayment or stock repurchase, has no loans outstanding under the agreement or more than $10 million in letters of credit issued under the agreement.
Under Bermuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.
Share repurchases
The Company’s share repurchase activity was as follows:

In February 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of Signet’s common shares up to $750.0 million (the “2016 Program”). In August 2016, the Board increased its authorized share repurchase program by $625.0 million, bringing the total authorization for the 2016 Program to $1.4 billion. The 2016 Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
On October 5, 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a large financial institution to repurchase $525.0 million of the Company’s common shares. At inception, the Company paid $525.0 million to the financial institution and took delivery of 4.7 million shares with an initial estimated cost of $367.5 million. In December 2016, the ASR was finalized and the Company received an additional 1.3 million shares. Total shares repurchased under the ASR were 6.0 million shares at an average purchase price of $87.01 per share based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common shares traded during the pricing period, less an agreed discount.
In June 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase $600.0 million of Signet’s common shares (the “2017 Program”). The 2017 Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.
The total authorization remaining under all authorized repurchase programs as of February 3, 2018 was $650.6 million.
Movement in Cash and Indebtedness
Cash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2018 were $225.1 million compared to $98.7 million as of January 28, 2017. Signet has significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents invested in various ‘AAA’ rated liquidity funds and at a number of financial institutions. The amount invested in each liquidity fund or at each financial institution takes into account the credit rating and size of the liquidity fund or financial institution and is invested for short-term durations.
At February 3, 2018, Signet had $739.3 million of outstanding debt, comprised of $398.9 million of senior unsecured notes, a $326.2 million term loan facility, and bank overdrafts totaling $14.2 million. During Fiscal 2018, the Company utilized the gross proceeds from the sale of the prime portion of the in-house receivables to repay the $600 million asset-backed securitization facility. The term loan requires the Company to make scheduled quarterly principal payments over the five-year term. During Fiscal 2018, $22.3 million in principal payments were made.
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, Signet amended and restated its Credit Facility agreement to (i) increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $400 million to $700 million and extend the maturity date to July 2021 and (ii) extend the maturity date of the term loan facility to July 2021 and revise the scheduled quarterly principal repayments to align with the July 2021 maturity date. Additionally, Signet amended the note purchase agreement associated with the asset-backed securitization facility to extend the term of the facility by one year to May 2018 with remaining terms substantially consistent with the existing agreement.
The Company had stand-by letters of credit on the revolving credit facility of $15.7 million and $15.3 million as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, that reduce remaining availability under the revolving credit facility.
Net debt (non-GAAP measure, see Item 6) was $507.1 million as of February 3, 2018 compared to net debt of $1.3 billion as of January 28, 2017.

Capital availability
Signet’s level of borrowings and cash balances fluctuates during the year reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow requirements and business performance. Management believes that cash balances and the committed borrowing facilities (including the Credit Facility described more fully in Note 20 of Item 8) currently available to the business are sufficient for both its present and near term requirements. The following table provides a summary of these items as of February 3, 2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016:

In addition to cash generated from operating activities, during Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, Signet also had funds available from the credit facilities described above.
Signet’s Credit Facility contains various customary representations and warranties, financial reporting requirements and other affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility requires that Signet maintain at all times a “Leverage Ratio” (as defined in the agreement) to be no greater than 2.50 to 1.00 and a “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” (as defined in the agreement) to be no less than 1.40 to 1.00, both determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter of Signet for the trailing twelve months.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
Merchandise held on consignment
Signet held $606.4 million of consignment inventory which is not recorded on the balance sheet at February 3, 2018, as compared to $574.0 million at January 28, 2017. The principal terms of the consignment agreements, which can generally be terminated by either party, are such that Signet can return any, or all of, the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalty.
Contingent property liabilities
At February 3, 2018, approximately 19 property leases had been assigned by Signet to third parties (and remained unexpired and occupied by assignees at that date) and approximately 10 additional properties were sub-let at that date. Should the assignees or sub-tenants fail to fulfill any obligations in respect of those leases or any other leases which have at any other time been assigned or sub-let, Signet or one of its UK subsidiaries may be liable for those defaults. The number of such claims arising to date has been small, and the liability, which is charged to the income statement as it arises, has not been material.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
A summary of operating lease obligations is set out below. These primarily relate to minimum payments due under store lease arrangements. The majority of the store operating leases provide for the payment of base rentals plus real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees and merchant association dues. Additional information regarding Signet’s operating leases is available in Item 2 and Note 26 included in Item 8.
Long-term debt obligations comprise borrowings with an original maturity of greater than one year. It is expected that operating commitments will be funded from future operating cash flows and no additional facilities will be required to meet these obligations.

(2) Includes future interest payments on all long-term debt obligations, inclusive of both fixed- and variable-rate debt. Projected interest costs on variable rate debt were calculated using rates in effect at February 3, 2018. Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated income statements.

(3) Operating lease obligations relate to minimum payments due under store lease arrangements. Most store operating leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance fees. Real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance fees were approximately 30% of base rentals for Fiscal 2018. These are not included in the table above. Some operating leases also require additional payments based on a percentage of sales.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Other long-term liabilities reflect loss reserves related to credit insurance services provided by insurance subsidiaries. We have reflected these payments under “Other,” as the timing of the future payments is dependent on the actual processing of the claims.

Not included in the table above are obligations under employment agreements and ordinary course purchase orders for merchandise.

IMPACT OF INFLATION
The impact of inflation on Signet’s results for the past three years has not been significant apart from the impact of the commodity costs changes, and in the UK, the impact on merchandise costs due to the currency translation of the British pound against the US dollar.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies covering areas of greater complexity that are subject to the exercise of judgment due to the reliance on key estimates are listed below. A comprehensive listing of Signet’s significant accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Revenue recognition for extended service plans and lifetime warranty agreements (“ESP”)
The Company recognizes revenue related to lifetime warranty sales in proportion to when the expected costs will be incurred. The deferral period for lifetime warranty sales in each division is determined from patterns of claims costs, including estimates of future claims costs expected to be incurred. Management reviews the trends in claims to assess whether changes are required to the revenue and cost recognition rates utilized. A significant change in estimates related to the time period or pattern in which warranty-related costs are expected to be incurred could materially impact revenues. The deferral period and recognition rates of deferred revenue related to lifetime warranty sales is determined based on multi-year patterns of claims costs; therefore, a shift in historical experience of claims cost and frequency over several periods would be required to alter the revenue recognition pattern materially. All direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized.
The Sterling Jewelers division sells ESP, subject to certain conditions, to perform repair work over the life of the product. Revenue from the sale of the lifetime ESP is recognized consistent with the estimated pattern of claim costs expected to be incurred by the Company in connection with performing under the ESP obligations. Based on an evaluation of historical claims data, management currently estimates that substantially all claims will be incurred within 17 years of the sale of the warranty contract.
In the second quarter of Fiscal 2016, an operational change related to the Sterling Jewelers division’s ESP associated with ring sizing was made to further align Zale and Sterling ESP policies. As a result, revenue from the sale of these lifetime ESP in the Sterling Jewelers division is deferred and recognized over 17 years for all plans, with approximately 57% of revenue recognized within the first two years for plans sold on or after May 2, 2015 (January 28, 2017: 57%) and 42% of revenue recognized within the first two years for plans sold prior to May 2, 2015 (January 28, 2017: 42%; January 30, 2016: 42%).

Table of Contents

The Zale division also sells ESP. Zale Jewelry customers are offered lifetime warranties on certain products that cover sizing and breakage with an option to purchase theft protection for a two-year period. Revenue from the sale of lifetime ESP is deferred and recognized over 10 years, with approximately 69% of revenue recognized within the first two years (January 28, 2017: 69%; January 30, 2016: 69%).
Deferred revenue related to extended service plans, voucher promotions and other items at the end of Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 was $957.5 million and $935.9 million, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Potentially impaired assets or asset groups are identified by reviewing the cash flows of individual stores. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, based on the Company’s internal business plans. If the undiscounted cash flow is less than the asset’s carrying amount, the impairment charge recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company utilizes historical experience, internal business plans and an appropriate discount rate to estimate the fair value. Property and equipment at stores planned for closure are depreciated over a revised estimate of their useful lives.
In Fiscal 2018, the income statement includes a charge of $1.0 million for impairment of assets as compared to $1.3 million in Fiscal 2017. Property, plant and equipment, net, totaled $877.9 million as of February 3, 2018 and $822.9 million as of January 28, 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 was $194.1 million and $175.0 million, respectively. Application of alternative assumptions, such as changes in estimates of future cash flows, could produce significantly different results. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations in Fiscal 2018.
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill). If the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment to be recognized, if any. The two-step impairment test involves estimating the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill, through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies.
The annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the Sterling Jewelers reporting unit is the last day of the fourth quarter. The annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the reporting units associated with the Zale division and the Other reporting unit is May 31. There have been no goodwill impairment charges recorded during the fiscal periods presented in the consolidated financial statements as financial results for the reporting units have met or exceeded financial projections developed at the time of the acquisitions. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required. Goodwill totaled $821.7 million as of February 3, 2018 and $517.6 million as of January 28, 2017.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the second quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company estimates the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset, compares that value with its carrying amount and records an impairment charge, if any.
During Fiscal 2018, the Company performed a quantitative assessment related to the indefinite-lived trade names held in the Zale Jewelry segment.  As of February 3, 2018, the carrying value of the trade names was $374.0 million with the approximate fair value of those trade names exceeding carrying value by approximately 5-10%. The fair value was estimated using an income-based approach based on management's estimates of forecasted cash flows, with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. The valuations include assumptions related to sales trends, discount rates, royalty rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled $478.4 million as of February 3, 2018 and $404.8 million as of January 28, 2017.
During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company observed a general decline in the market valuation of the Company’s common shares which could impact the assumptions used to perform an evaluation of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill and trade names. As of the date of this report, the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived trade names continues to exceed the carrying values. However, the Company will continue to monitor sales trends, interest rates, and other key inputs to the estimates of fair value. A further decline in the key inputs, especially sales trends used in the valuation of trade names, may result in an impairment charge.

 Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence, both positive and negative, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and results of recent operations. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $37.0 million and $31.5 million, as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, due to uncertainties related to the Company’s ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating losses, foreign tax credits and foreign capital losses carried forward.
The annual effective tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company does not recognize tax benefits related to positions taken on certain tax matters unless the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At any point in time, various tax years are subject to or are in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. The Company records a reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. To the extent that management’s estimates of settlements change, or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the reserve for uncertain tax positions decreased by 10%, the impact would be approximately $1.3 million as of February 3, 2018. See Note 10 in Item 8 for additional information regarding deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at their nominal amounts and primarily include account balances outstanding from Sterling Jewelers division in-house customer finance programs. The finance receivables from the in-house customer finance programs are comprised of a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance. The initial acceptance of customer finance arrangements is based on proprietary consumer credit model scores. Subsequent to the initial financed purchase, the Company monitors the credit quality of its customer finance receivable portfolio based on payment activity driving the aging of receivables, as well as through the use of proprietary behavioral and collection models which assess each account’s probability of default based on performance on their account and regularly refreshed credit bureau attributes.
Accounts receivable under the customer finance programs are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. This allowance represents management’s estimate of the expected losses in the accounts receivable portfolio as of the balance sheet date, and is calculated using a model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates.
Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company calculated the allowance for uncollectible amounts on a recency basis. An allowance for amounts 90 days aged and under was established based on historical loss experience and payment performance information. A 100% allowance was made for any amount aged more than 90 days on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which had filed for bankruptcy. The recency-aging methodology is based on receipt of qualifying payments which vary depending on the account status. A customer’s account ages each month five days after their due date listed on their statement, allowing for a grace period before collection efforts begin. A qualifying payment can be no less than 75% of the scheduled payment, increasing with the delinquency level. If an account holder is two payments behind, then they must make a full minimum payment to return to current status. If an account holder is three payments behind, then they must make three full payments before returning to a current status. If an account holder is more than three payments behind, then the entire past due amount is required to return to a current status. The allowance calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether, based on economic events, additional analysis is required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance at January 28, 2017 was $138.7 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of $2.0 billion.
In the fourth quarter of identified within the portfolio when calculating the overall allowance for the portfolio.
The overall allowance continues to be based on the Company’s historical loss experience and payment performance information for accounts with similar credit quality characteristics as the remaining portfolio since the inception of the in-house consumer financing program, which was operated under the Company’s measure of delinquency and collection strategies in place prior to October 2017. As a result of the credit transaction disclosed in Note 3 of Item 8, the measure of delinquency and collection strategies have been revised to align with contractual method, which may result in different customer payment behaviors. A 100% allowance is made for accounts associated with bankrupt or deceased cardholders, as well as for accounts more than 120 days past due on the contractual basis. The Company’s policy for charging off uncollectible receivables is 180 days past due on a contractual basis.

Table of Contents

Allowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the consolidated income statement. The allowance at February 3, 2018 was $113.5 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of $762.9 million. If management’s estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts had been different by 10% at the end of Fiscal 2018, cost of sales would have been impacted by approximately $11.4 million.

For a discussion of these risks and other risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement, see Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Signet undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law.

GAAP AND NON-GAAP MEASURES

The following discussion and analysis of the results conjunction with Signet’s financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8.
A number of non-GAAP measures are used by management to analyze and manage the performance of the business. See 
Exchange Translation Impact
The monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales. In Fiscal 2019, it is anticipated a five percent movement in the British pound to US dollar exchange rate would impact income before income taxes by approximately $2.0 million, while a five percent movement in the Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rate would have a negligible impact on income before income taxes.
Fiscal 2018 Overview
Similar to many other retailers, Signet follows the retail 4-4-5 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 (the “53rd week”). The 53rd week added $84.3 million in net sales and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.12 for both the quarter and Fiscal 2018.
Same store sales decreased 5.3% compared to a decrease of 1.9% in Fiscal 2017; total sales were down 2.4% to $6.3 billion compared to $6.4 billion in Fiscal 

40

Table of Contents

Signet’s long-term debt was $688.2 million at February 3, 2018 and $1.3 billion at January 28, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $225.1 million and $98.7 million, as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively. During Fiscal 2018, Signet repurchased 8.1 million shares, which represented approximately 12% of the common shares outstanding, at an average cost of $56.91 per share.
Drivers of Operating Profitability
The key measures and drivers of operating profitability are:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• total sales - driven by the change in same store sales and net store selling space;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• gross margin - including the mix of results by store banner including brick-and-mortar locations and online;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• level of selling, general and administrative expenses; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other operating income, which primarily consists of finance income from the Company’s credit operations.

Same Store Sales
Same store sales growth is calculated by comparison of sales in stores that were open in both the current and the prior fiscal year. Sales from stores that have been open for less than 12 months, are excluded from the comparison until their 12-month anniversary. Sales after the 12-month anniversary are compared against the equivalent prior period sales within the or expanded, but remain within the same local geographic area, are included within the comparison with no adjustment to either the current or comparative period. Stores that have been refurbished are also included within the comparison except for the period when the refurbishment was taking place, when those stores are excluded from the comparison both for the current year and for the comparative considers same store sales useful as it is a major benchmark used by investors to judge performance within the retail industry.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales is mostly composed of merchandise costs (net of discounts and allowances). Cost of sales also contains:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Occupancy costs such as rent, common area maintenance, depreciation and real estate tax.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net bad debt expense and customers’ late payments primarily under the in-house customer finance program.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Store operating expenses such as utilities, displays and merchant credit costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Distribution and warehousing costs including freight, processing, inventory shrinkage and related payroll.

As the classification of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have in-house customer finance programs, Signet’s gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers.

Signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and, as jewelry inventory turns some time before being reflected in the gross margin. An increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross margin.
Accounts receivable comprise a large volume Fiscal 2018, the Company began measuring delinquency under the contractual basis which aligns with the processes and collection strategies utilized by the Company’s third party credit service provider for the remaining in-house finance receivable portfolio beginning in October 2017. Under this measure of delinquency, credit card accounts are considered delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date. The aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer has failed to make a minimum payment. Management utilizes the delinquency rates identified within the portfolio when calculating the overall allowance for the portfolio.
The overall allowance continues to be based on the Company’s historical loss experience and payment performance contractual method, which may result in different customer payment behaviors. A 100% allowance is made for accounts associated with bankrupt or deceased cardholders, as well as for accounts more than 120 days past due on the contractual basis. The Company’s policy for charging off uncollectible receivables is 180 days.
A small portion of sales under the Zale banners are financed through our in-house customer programs but represent an immaterial amount of the Company’s credit sales, receivable balance, and bad debt expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense (“SGA”)
SGA expense primarily elsewhere in the consolidated income statements.
The primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees and the level of compensation, taxes and other benefits paid. Management variable. A significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales and operating profit.
The level of advertising expenditure can vary. The largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by management’s judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
In Fiscal 2018, gross margin was $2,190.0 million or 35.0% of sales compared to $2,360.8 million or 36.8% of sales in Fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin dollars was attributable to a decline in the gross merchandise margin rate and de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 to distribution center consolidation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 was offset by an increase in the gross merchandise margin rate primarily due to merchandise mix.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 principally by lower sales volumes, a decline in the gross merchandise margin rate due to promotions and mix and de-leverage on store occupancy costs.

In the fourth quarter, the consolidated gross margin basis point impact related to R2Net, which carries a lower gross margin rate, lower sales, leading to de-leverage on fixed costs and merchandise mix.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Sterling Jewelers gross margin decreased $36.7 million. The gross margin rate declined 220 basis points, of which 120 basis points is attributed to the inclusion of R2Net. The remainder of the rate decline is primarily due to de-leverage of fixed costs offset in part by a higher gross merchandise margin rate. Net bad debt expense had no material impact on the gross margin rate.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Zale Division gross margin increased by $14.0 million. The gross margin rate decreased by 10 basis points, driven primarily by higher sales leading to leverage on fixed costs, partially offset by a decline in gross merchandise margin rate due to merchandise mix.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross margin dollars in the UK Jewelry Division decreased $3.3 million. The gross margin rate declined by 240 basis points due to lower sales leading to de-leverage on fixed costs.

Working Capital
Changes to accounts receivable are driven by the Sterling Jewelers division in-house credit program. If a customer makes use with CarVal Investors to sell all eligible non-prime in-house accounts receivable. Upon completion of the transaction announced in March 2018, the working capital requirements for Signet are expected to decrease materially as there will no longer be an in-house credit program funded by the Company.
In Fiscal 2018, 57.9% of the Sterling Jewelers division’s sales were made using customer financing provided in credit participation and the collection rate impact the level of receivables.
Changes to accounts payable are primarily driven by the timing and amount of merchandise purchased, the mix of merchandise once approximately every 12 months.
Signet’s working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales, and movements in the British pound and Canadian dollar for the fourth quarter, there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid- to late-November. The peak level of working capital is typically $100 million to $150 million above the typical January to August level, and can be accentuated by new store openings. The working capital position then reverses over the Holiday Season.
The change in inventory is primarily driven by the majority of inventory held on consignment is in the US, which at February 3, 2018 amounted to $606.4 million as compared to $574.0 million at January 28, 2017. The principal terms of the consignment agreements, inventory, it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item. The sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis (see principal accounting policies, Item 8).
Signet’s working capital in working capital.
Signet’s largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits. These are typically paid on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis, with annual bonus payments 
Investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital, as well as fixed capital investment, due to the inventory turn, and the additional investment required to fund sales in the in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower, while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the purchases of property, plant and equipment related to the:

- ----------------------------------
• rate of space expansion in the US;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• investment in existing stores, reflecting the level of investment in sales-enhancing technology, and the number of store remodels and relocations carried out; and

- ------------------------------------------------------
• investments in IT modernization and digital ecosystem.

When evaluating new store investment, management uses an investment hurdle rate of a 20% internal rate of return on a pre-tax basis over a five such expenditure. A remodel is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store. Minor store refurbishments are typically carried out every five years. In addition to store remodels, Signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full remodel; this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal. Where possible, the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities.
In Fiscal 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $569.4 million, compared to IT. See table below for additional information regarding capital additions.

IMPACT OF INFLATION
The impact of inflation on Signet’s results for the past three years has not been significant apart from the impact of the commodity costs changes, and in the UK, the impact on merchandise costs due to the currency translation of the British pound against the US dollar.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies covering areas of greater complexity that are subject to the exercise Item 8.
Revenue recognition for extended service plans and lifetime warranty agreements (“ESP”)
The Company recognizes revenue related to lifetime warranty sales in proportion to when the expected costs All direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized.
The Sterling Jewelers division sells ESP, subject to certain conditions, to the sale of the warranty contract.
In the second quarter of Fiscal 2016, an operational change related to the Sterling Jewelers division’s ESP associated with ring sizing was made to further align Zale and Sterling ESP policies. As a result, revenue from the sale of these lifetime ESP in the Sterling Jewelers division is deferred and recognized over 17 years for all plans, with approximately 57% of revenue recognized within the first two years for plans sold on or after May 2, 2015 (January 28, 2017: 57%) and 42% of revenue recognized within the first two years for plans sold prior to May 2, 2015 (January 28, 2017: 42%; January 30, 2016: 42%).

Table of Contents

The Zale division also sells ESP. Zale Jewelry customers are offered lifetime warranties on certain products that cover sizing and within the first two years (January 28, 2017: 69%; January 30, 2016: 69%).
Deferred revenue related to extended service plans, voucher promotions and other items at the end of Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 was $957.5 million and $935.9 million, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Potentially impaired assets or asset groups are identified by reviewing the cash flows of individual stores. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is for closure are depreciated over a revised estimate of their useful lives.
In Fiscal 2018, the income statement includes a charge of $1.0 million for impairment of assets as compared to $1.3 million in Fiscal 2017. Property, plant and equipment, net, totaled $877.9 million as of February 3, 2018 and $822.9 million as of January 28, 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations in Fiscal 2018.
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill). If the Company concludes that it is not more likely than not future cash flows or market-based methodologies.
The annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the Sterling Jewelers reporting unit is the last day of the fourth quarter. The annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the reporting units associated with the Zale division and the Other reporting unit is May 31. There have been no goodwill impairment charges recorded during the fiscal periods presented are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.
