EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, Hunt's®, Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, Orville Redenbacher's®, as well as emerging brands, including Alexia®, Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP®, Blake's®, Duke's®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion.
Fiscal 2018 performance compared to fiscal 2017 reflected improving net sales trends, due to innovation and renovation of some of our largest brands and enhanced marketing methods. Higher gross profits in the International and Foodservice segments were offset by slightly lower gross profits in the Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. Despite a challenging inflationary environment, we achieved significantly improved earnings in fiscal 2018. The improved operating performance reflected significantly lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses and lower interest expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was signed into law. The Tax Act reduces tax rates and modifies certain policies, credits, and deductions and has certain international tax consequences. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The Tax Act's corporate rate reduction became effective January 1, 2018, in the middle of our third quarter. Given our off-calendar fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal statutory tax rate was a blended rate. Our federal statutory rate will reduce to 21% in fiscal 2019. As a result, we were required to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the Tax Act. These changes resulted in a one-time estimated income tax benefit of $233.3 million for fiscal 2018. This amount may be adjusted in the future as further information and interpretations become available.
Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were $1.98, including earnings of $1.95 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 were $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "Items Impacting Comparability" below).
On June 26, 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Pinnacle and Patriot Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of us ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Pinnacle, with Pinnacle continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and Pinnacle will survive as our wholly-owned subsidiary.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Pinnacle common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares as to which dissenter's rights have been properly exercised and certain other excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive (i) $43.11 in cash and (ii) 0.6494 shares of our common stock, with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock. The implied price of $68.00 per Pinnacle share is based on the volume-weighted average price of our stock for the five days ended June 21, 2018.
We have secured $9.0 billion in fully committed bridge financing from affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in connection with the planned acquisition of Pinnacle. The commitments under the committed bridge financing were subsequently reduced by the amounts of a term loan agreement we entered into on July 11, 2018 with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for term loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.3 billion. The funding under the term loan agreement is anticipated to occur simultaneously with the closing date of the acquisition. In connection with the merger, we expect to incur up to $8.3 billion of long-term debt (which includes any funding under the new term loan agreement), including for the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration, the repayment of Pinnacle debt, the refinancing of certain Conagra debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses. The permanent financing is also expected to include approximately $600 million of incremental cash proceeds from the issuance of equity and/or divestitures.
The planned acquisition of Pinnacle is expected to close by the end of calendar 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding Pinnacle common stock, (ii) there being no law or order that restrains, enjoins, or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the planned acquisition or the issuance of our common stock in connection with the planned acquisition, and (iii) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the planned acquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

22

Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and receipt of other required antitrust approvals. The obligation of each of us and Pinnacle to consummate the planned acquisition is also conditioned on the other party's representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed, in all material respects, its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The closing of the planned acquisition is not subject to a financing condition.

Segment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and economic hedging of foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in the segment review below.
Acquisitions
As noted above, on June 26, 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Pinnacle under which we will acquire all outstanding shares of Pinnacle common stock in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion, including Pinnacle's outstanding net debt. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $43.11 per share in cash and 0.6494 shares of our common stock for each share of Pinnacle common stock held. The planned acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar 2018 and remains subject to the approval of Pinnacle shareholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.
In February 2018, we acquired the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, maker of frozen breakfast and entree flatbread pocket sandwiches, for a cash purchase price of $87.3 million, net of cash acquired. Approximately $57.8 million has been classified as goodwill, subject to final purchase price allocation, and $9.7 million and $7.1 million have been classified as non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The amount of goodwill allocated is deductible for tax purposes. The business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment.
In October 2017, we acquired Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, maker of Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP® ready-to-eat popcorn, for a cash purchase price of $249.8 million, net of cash acquired. Approximately $155.2 million has been classified as goodwill, subject to final purchase price allocation, of which $95.4 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $73.8 million and $10.3 million of the purchase price have been allocated to non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The business is primarily included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.
In April 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired (the "Thanasi acquisition"). Approximately $133.3 million has been classified as goodwill, of which $70.5 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $65.1 million and $16.1 million of the purchase price have been allocated to non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. These businesses are primarily included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.
In September 2016, we acquired the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, including the Frontera®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands (the "Frontera acquisition"). These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products and contemporary American cooking sauces. We acquired the businesses for $108.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Approximately $39.5 million has been classified as goodwill and $59.5 million and $7.2 million have been classified as non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. These businesses are included primarily in the Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within the Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments.
Divestitures
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which is part of our International segment. The transaction was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and was valued at approximately $43.0 million Canadian dollars, which was approximately $34.0 million U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of announcement.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we signed an agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business, which is part of our Grocery & Snacks segment, to The J.M. Smucker Company ("Smucker"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Conagra Brands and Smucker terminated the agreement. This outcome followed the decision of the Federal Trade Commission, announced on March 5, 2018, to challenge the pending sale. The Company is still actively marketing the Wesson® oil business and expects to sell it within the next twelve months.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the previously announced spinoff (the "Spinoff") of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston"). The results of operations of the Lamb Weston business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are included in the Commercial segment.

24

On February 1, 2016, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, with TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("TreeHouse"), we completed the disposition of our Private Brands business to TreeHouse for $2.6 billion in cash on a debt-free basis. The results of operations of the Private Brands business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Restructuring Plans
In May 2013, we announced the Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (the "SCAE Plan"), our plan to integrate and restructure the operations of our Private Brands business, improve SG&A effectiveness and efficiencies, and optimize our supply chain network, manufacturing assets, dry distribution centers, and mixing centers. In fiscal 2016, we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing SG&A expenses and enhancing trade spend processes and tools, which plans were included as part of the SCAE Plan. Although we divested the Private Brands business, we have continued to implement the SCAE Plan, including by working to optimize our supply chain network, pursue cost reductions through our SG&A functions, enhance trade spend processes and tools, and improve productivity.
Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire SCAE Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2018, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of May 27, 2018, our Board of Directors has approved the incurrence of up to $900.9 million of expenses in connection with the SCAE Plan, including expenses allocated for the Private Brands and Lamb Weston operations. We have incurred or expect to incur approximately $471.6 million of charges ($322.1 million of cash charges and $149.5 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations. We recognized charges of $38.0 million, $63.6 million, and $281.8 million in relation to the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect to incur costs related to the SCAE Plan over a multi-year period.

SEGMENT REVIEW

We reflect our results of operations in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, Foodservice, International, and Commercial.

Grocery & Snacks
The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.
Refrigerated & Frozen
The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.
International
The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.
Foodservice
The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.
Commercial
The Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which were sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings®. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.
The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations, under this methodology:

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---- ------------ ---- ------------ ---- ----- - - ----- -

Net derivative losses allocated to Commercial — (0.1 ) (1.7 )
Net derivative gains (losses) included in segment operating profit $ (7.1 ) $ 5.7 $ (23.8 )

As of May 27, 2018, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $3.2 million, all of which was incurred during the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $2.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $0.7 million in fiscal 2020 and thereafter.
Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017
Net Sales

-------------------------------- --------------------- ------- --------------------- ------- ---------- ------- ---- -- - -

($ in millions)Reporting Segment Fiscal 2018 Net Sales Fiscal 2017 Net Sales % Inc(Dec)
Grocery & Snacks $ 3,287.0 $ 3,208.8 2 %
Refrigerated & Frozen 2,753.0 2,652.7 4 %
International 843.5 816.0 3 %
Foodservice 1,054.8 1,078.3 (2 )%
Commercial — 71.1 (100 )%
Total $ 7,938.3 $ 7,826.9 1 %

Overall, our net sales were $7.94 billion in fiscal 2018, an increase of 1% compared to fiscal 2017.
Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2018 were $3.29 billion, an increase of $78.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/

26

mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively.
Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2018 were $2.75 billion, an increase of $100.3 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera® brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.
International net sales for fiscal 2018 were $843.5 million, an increase of $27.5 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% increase due to foreign exchange rates, and a 3% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2017. The volume decrease for fiscal 2018 was driven by strategic decisions to eliminate lower margin products and to reduce promotional intensity. The increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period was driven by improvements in pricing and trade productivity.
Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2018 were $1.05 billion, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected an 11% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 9% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in volumes compared to the prior-year period primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business, the planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing businesses, and softness in certain categories. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2018 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value over volume strategy.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses had net sales of $71.1 million in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures.
SG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)
SG&A expenses totaled $1.32 billion for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $99.1 million compared to fiscal 2017. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2018 reflected the following:

Grocery & Snacks $ 724.8 $ 653.7 11 %
Refrigerated & Frozen 479.4 445.8 8 %

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $724.8 million, an increase of $71.1 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $20.2 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. The lower gross profit was driven by investments with retailers (i.e., trade spending reflected as a reduction of net sales), as well as higher input costs and transportation expenses, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity. The Frontera acquisition, Thanasi acquisition, and the acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which occurred in September 2016, April 2017, and October 2017, respectively, contributed $47.4 million to Grocery & Snacks gross profit during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions (if reached). Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $19.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $4.0 million in fiscal 2018 for the impairment of our HK Anderson®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brand assets and $68.3 million in fiscal 2017 primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset. Grocery & Snacks also incurred $11.4 million of expenses in fiscal 2018 related to acquisitions and divestitures, charges of $31.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the

28

Wesson® oil business, and charges of $14.1 million and $25.3 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $479.4 million, an increase of $33.6 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $3.6 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, driven by continuing increases in input costs and transportation inflation as well as investments to drive distribution, enhanced shelf presence, and trial, partially offset by increased sales volumes and supply chain realized productivity. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $4.6 million to gross profit in the segment during fiscal 2018. Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $23.4 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to a product recall, as well as charges of $0.1 million and $6.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
International operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $86.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $168.9 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss in fiscal 2017 includes charges totaling $235.9 million for the impairment of goodwill and an intangible brand asset in our Canadian and Mexican operations. Gross profits were $18.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, as a result of improved price/mix, the favorable impact of foreign exchange, and the planned discontinuations of certain lower-performing products. Operating profit of the International segment was impacted by charges of $1.5 million and $0.9 million in connection with our restructuring plans, in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $121.8 million, an increase of $16.7 million, or 16%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $13.9 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing and supply chain realized productivity, partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased input costs. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection with our restructuring plans.
Commercial operating profit was $202.6 million in fiscal 2017. The Company sold the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, recognizing pre-tax gains totaling $197.4 million. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. There are no further operations in the Commercial segment.
Interest Expense, Net
In fiscal 2018, net interest expense was $158.7 million, a decrease of $36.8 million, or 19%, from fiscal 2017. The decrease reflects the repayment of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, $473.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, $119.6 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as the exchange of $1.44 billion of debt in connection with the Spinoff of Lamb Weston during the second quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the borrowing of $300.0 million under our term loan agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. For more information about the debt exchange, see Note 4 "Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense was $174.6 million and $254.7 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 18% and 32% for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Tax Act was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The changes to U.S. tax law include, but are not limited to:
•reducing the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018;
•eliminating the deduction for domestic manufacturing activities, which impacts us beginning in fiscal 2019;
•requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• repealing the exception for deductibility of performance-based compensation to covered employees, along with expanding the number of covered employees;

•allowing immediate expensing of machinery and equipment contracted for purchase after September 27, 2017; and

29

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• changing taxation of multinational companies, including a new minimum tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, a new Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, and a new U.S. corporate deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income, all of which are effective for us beginning in 2019.

As a result of our fiscal year end, the lower U.S. statutory federal income tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 29.3% for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. The U.S. federal statutory rate is expected to be 21% for fiscal years beginning after May 27, 2018.
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 reflects the following:

- ----------------------------------------------
• the impact of U.S. tax reform, as noted above,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an adjustment of valuation allowance associated with the termination of the agreement for the proposed sale of our Wesson® oil business,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• an indirect cost of the pension contribution made on February 26, 2018,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional expense related to the settlement of an audit of the impact of a law change in Mexico,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional expense related to undistributed foreign earnings for which the indefinite reinvestment assertion is no longer made.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 reflects the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill sold in connection with the divestitures of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill in our Mexican and Canadian businesses, for which an impairment charge was recognized,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit for the adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with the planned divestiture of the Wesson® oil business,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit for excess tax benefits allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and certain foreign incentives.

We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 23%-24%.
Equity Method Investment Earnings
We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $97.3 million and $71.2 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. A benefit of $4.3 million was included in the earnings of fiscal 2018 in connection with a gain on the substantial liquidation of an international joint venture. In addition, Ardent Mills earnings were higher than they were in the prior-year periods due to more favorable market conditions and continued improvement in operating effectiveness.

30

Results of Discontinued Operations
Our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $14.3 million and $102.0 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. During fiscal 2018, a $14.5 million income tax benefit was recorded due to an adjustment of the estimated deductibility of the costs incurred associated with effecting the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. The prior-year period results reflected the operations of Lamb Weston through the date of its Spinoff in November 2016. We incurred significant costs associated with effecting the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. These costs are included in results of discontinued operations.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were $1.98, including earnings of $1.95 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 were $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. See "Items Impacting Comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.

Commercial 71.1 468.1 (85 )%
Total $ 7,826.9 $ 8,664.1 (10 )%

Overall, our net sales were $7.83 billion in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 10% compared to fiscal 2016.
Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2017 were $3.21 billion, a decrease of $168.3 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2016. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in sales volumes was the result of reduced trade promotions and the planned exit of certain lower-performing products. Price/mix was flat as the continued progress in pricing and trade productivity was fully offset by unfavorable sales mix. The reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases are actions that are intended to build a higher quality revenue base. The Frontera acquisition and the Thanasi acquisition collectively contributed $36.5 million, or 1%, to segment net sales during fiscal 2017.
Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2017 were $2.65 billion, a decrease of $215.1 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2016. Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease in sales volumes and improvements in price/mix reflected reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases, together with stock-keeping unit rationalization, which actions were intended to build a higher quality revenue base. Net sales growth was also negatively affected by a transitory increase in the volume of Egg Beaters® in fiscal 2016 as the Company's egg supply was not negatively impacted by the avian influenza outbreak in fiscal 2015.
International net sales for fiscal 2017 were $816.0 million, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2016. Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. The volume decrease for fiscal 2017 was driven by significant shipments in early fiscal 2016 due to recovery from the West Coast port disruptions during fiscal 2015, aggressive pricing actions, reduced trade promotions, and the planned discontinuation of certain lower-margin products.
Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2017 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $26.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2016. Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 4% decrease in volume offset by a 2% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease in volumes primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business.

31

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses had net sales of $71.1 million in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures. Net sales in the Commercial segment were $468.1 million in fiscal 2016.
SG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)
SG&A expenses totaled $1.42 billion for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $607.5 million compared to fiscal 2016. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2017 reflected the following:

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $653.7 million, an increase of $60.8 million, or 10%, compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profits were $36.5 million higher in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. The higher gross profit was driven by reduced trade promotions, improved plant productivity, and lower commodity input costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, due in part to pricing actions on certain products. SG&A expenses decreased by $24.3 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, largely as a result of cost reductions achieved through our restructuring plans, as well as a $5.6 million reduction in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $68.3 million and $50.1 million, primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, $31.4 million in charges in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the Wesson® oil business, and charges of $25.3 million and $51.8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $445.8 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profits were $24.7 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by decreased sales volumes primarily associated with the transitory increase in the volume of Egg Beaters® in fiscal 2016, discussed above, partially offset by the impact of lower commodity input costs, increased net pricing primarily as a result of reduced trade promotions, and improved plant productivity. SG&A expenses decreased by $50.1 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, largely as a result of cost reductions achieved through our restructuring plans, as well as a $8.9 million reduction in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to a product recall, as well as charges of $6.2 million and $21.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
International incurred an operating loss for fiscal 2017 of $168.9 million and earned an operating profit of $66.7 million in fiscal 2016. The operating loss in fiscal 2017 includes charges totaling $235.9 million for the impairment of goodwill and an intangible brand asset in our Canadian and Mexican operations. Gross profits were $8.5 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating profits were negatively impacted by $9.9 million from the impact of foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016.
Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $105.1 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profits were $5.6 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by volume declines and product supply shortfalls. This was offset by an inventory write-down in fiscal 2016 at a foreign non-core popcorn business that we have since exited. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection with our restructuring plans.
Commercial operating profit was $202.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $45.4 million in fiscal 2016. The Company sold the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, recognizing pre-tax gains totaling $197.4 million. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. There are no further operations in the Commercial segment.

33

Interest Expense, Net
In fiscal 2017, net interest expense was $195.5 million, a decrease of $100.3 million, or 34%, from fiscal 2016. The decrease reflects the repayment of $2.15 billion, $550 million, and $473 million of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and the third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as well as the exchange of $1.44 billion of debt in connection with the Spinoff of Lamb Weston during the second quarter of 2017.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense was $254.7 million and $46.4 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 32% for fiscal 2017 and 27% for fiscal 2016.
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 reflects the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill sold in connection with the divestitures of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill in our Mexican and Canadian businesses, for which an impairment charge was recognized,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit for the adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with the planned divestiture of the Wesson® oil business,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 the awards upon the date of grant, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and certain foreign incentives.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 reflects the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional tax expense related to legal entity changes for a business retained from the Private Brands business,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• a charge for the prior year implementation of a new tax position, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an income tax benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write-off of $348.5 million of actuarial losses under our method of accounting for pension benefits).

Equity Method Investment Earnings
We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $71.2 million and $66.1 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases are reflective of higher profits from the Ardent Mills joint venture due to more favorable wheat market conditions as well as improved operational effectiveness.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $102.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an after-tax loss of $794.4 million in fiscal 2016. Results reflected the operations of Lamb Weston through the date of its Spinoff in November 2016, as well as the results of the Private Brands business prior to its divestiture in the second half of fiscal 2016. We incurred significant costs associated with effecting the Spinoff. These costs are included in results of discontinued operations. We recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2016 to write down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the Private Brands business to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to recognize the final loss.

34

Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 were $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued operations. See "Items Impacting Comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of Liquidity and Capital
The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. If necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities), and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
At May 27, 2018, we had a revolving credit facility (the "Facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.25 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with the consent of the lenders). We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of May 27, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Facility. On July 11, 2018, subsequent to our fiscal year end, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.6 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion). It replaces the existing Facility and generally requires our ratio of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to interest expense to be not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA to not exceed certain specified levels, with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $70.0 million of our 2.1% senior notes on the maturity date of March 15, 2018.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a term loan agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") with a financial institution. The Term Loan Agreement provides for term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of $300.0 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we borrowed the full amount of the $300.0 million provided for under the Term Loan Agreement. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to make a voluntary pension plan contribution in the amount of $300.0 million. The Term Loan Agreement matures on February 26, 2019. The term loan bears interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum and is fully prepayable without penalty.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $119.6 million of our 1.9% senior notes on the maturity date of January 25, 2018.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we repaid the remaining capital lease liability balance of $28.5 million in connection with the early exit of an unfavorable lease contract.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due October 9, 2020. The notes bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum.
As of May 27, 2018, we had $277.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2018 was $469.7 million. As of May 28, 2017, we had $26.2 million outstanding under our commercial paper program.
As of the end of fiscal 2018, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult.

35

The Company has secured $9.0 billion in fully committed bridge financing from affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in connection with the Merger. The commitments under the committed bridge financing were subsequently reduced by the amounts of a term loan agreement we entered into on July 11, 2018 with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for term loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.3 billion. The funding under the term loan agreement is anticipated to occur simultaneously with the closing date of the acquisition. In connection with the merger, we expect to incur up to $8.3 billion of long-term debt (which includes any funding under the new term loan agreement), including for the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration, the repayment of Pinnacle debt, the refinancing of certain Conagra debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses. The permanent financing is also expected to include approximately $600 million of incremental cash proceeds from the issuance of equity and/or divestitures.
We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 27.4 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of $967.3 million. In May 2018, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion of share repurchases. The Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 27, 2018, was $1.41 billion. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we suspended share repurchase activity in light of the pending acquisition of Pinnacle. The Company plans to repurchase shares under its authorized program only at times and in amounts as is consistent with the prioritization of achieving its leverage targets.
On April 20, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.2125 per share, which was paid on May 31, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 30, 2018. Subject to market and other conditions and the approval of our Board of Directors, we intend to maintain our quarterly dividend at the current annual rate of $0.85 per share during fiscal 2019. In the future, we expect modest dividend increases while we focus on deleveraging, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada to Bonduelle Group. The transaction was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and was valued at approximately $43.0 million Canadian dollars, which was approximately $34.0 million U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of announcement.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we signed an agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business to Smucker for $285 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Conagra Brands and Smucker terminated the agreement. This outcome followed the decision of the Federal Trade Commission, announced on March 5, 2018, to challenge the pending transaction. The Company is still actively marketing the Wesson® oil business and expects to sell it within the next twelve months.
We have access to the $1.25 billion Facility, our commercial paper program, and the capital markets. We believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities, if needed.
We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration as well as to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity, as market conditions warrant, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions, access to capital markets, and our $1.25 billion Facility.
Cash Flows
In fiscal 2018, we used $123.4 million of cash, which was the net result of $954.2 million generated from operating activities, $576.2 million used in investing activities, $506.9 million used in financing activities, and an increase of $5.5 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $919.7 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to $1.14 billion generated in fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the net result of increased pension plan payments and changes in working capital, offset by reduced income tax and interest payments. Pension plan payments mainly consisted of voluntary contributions totaling $300.0 million and $150.0 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Year-over-year increases in receivables, higher inventory build, and payments made to terminate an unfavorable operating lease negatively impacted operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Income tax payment reductions were driven by the impact of corporate tax rate reductions resulting from the Tax Act signed into law during the third quarter of

36

fiscal 2018. Significant debt repayments during fiscal 2017 contributed to decreased interest payments in fiscal 2018. Payments related to incentive compensation and our restructuring plans were also reduced for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.
Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $34.5 million and $34.7 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. This primarily reflects the activities of the Lamb Weston business that was spun off on November 9, 2016 and, to a lesser extent, other divested businesses. Operating cash flows of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 were also impacted by expenses related to the Spinoff.
Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $576.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $65.6 million in fiscal 2017. Investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $251.6 million and the purchases of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business and Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC for a total of $337.1 million, net of cash acquired. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 included the proceeds from the divestitures of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses totaling $489.0 million in the aggregate, partially offset by capital expenditures of $242.1 million, and acquisitions totaling $325.7 million, including the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, and the protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC and BIGS LLC.
Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from capital expenditures.
Cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $506.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $2.41 billion in fiscal 2017. Financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of common stock repurchases of $967.3 million, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $797.0 million, cash dividend payments of $342.3 million, long-term debt repayments totaling $242.3 million, and net short-term borrowings of $249.1 million. Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 reflected debt repayments of $1.06 billion, common stock repurchases totaling $1.0 billion, and dividends paid of $415.0 million, partially offset by employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards of $73.8 million.
Cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations principally comprises borrowings by Lamb Weston which were transferred in connection with the Spinoff.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $128.0 million at May 27, 2018, and $251.4 million at May 28, 2017, of which $121.6 million at May 27, 2018, and $244.9 million at May 28, 2017, was held in foreign countries. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company repatriated $151.3 million of cash balances previously deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Refer to Note 15 "Pre-tax Income and Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for more information related to this repatriation of cash and related adjustments to deferred tax liability, as well as the impacts of the Tax Act on remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 is approximately $350 million, excluding any incremental amounts resulting from the pending acquisition of Pinnacle.
Management believes that the Company's sources of liquidity will be adequate finance the cash portion of the merger consideration, to satisfy working capital needs, repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time, make payments of anticipated quarterly dividends, complete planned capital expenditures, and make any required debt repayments, including by retiring or refinancing senior debt upon maturity (as market conditions warrant), for the foreseeable future.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in "Obligations and Commitments," below.
Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated
We lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the "lease put options") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the "put price") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these

37

lease put options became exercisable. During fiscal 2016, we entered into a series of related transactions in which we exchanged a warehouse we owned in Indiana for two buildings and parcels of land that we leased as part of our Omaha corporate offices. Concurrent with the asset exchange, the leases on the two Omaha corporate buildings, which were subject to contingent put options, were canceled. We recognized aggregate charges of $55.6 million for the early termination of these leases. We also entered into a lease for the warehouse in Indiana and we recorded a financing lease obligation of $74.2 million. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired. As a result of this expiration, we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts.
As of May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.2 million. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.80 billion as of May 27, 2018, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.26 billion as of May 27, 2018, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
A summary of our contractual obligations as of May 27, 2018, was as follows:

----------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- ------- --------------- ----- --------- ------- --------- ------------ ------- ---- ------- - -------

 Payments Due by Period(in millions)
Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5Years
Long-term debt $ 3,431.7 $ 300.0 $ 822.6 $ 1,087.0 $ 1,222.1
Capital lease obligations 94.7 7.1 13.5 13.5 60.6
Operating lease obligations 199.1 35.6 47.5 33.7 82.3
Purchase obligations1 and other contracts 1,127.0 966.7 121.3 37.6 1.4
Notes payable 277.3 277.3 — — —
Total $ 5,129.8 $ 1,586.7 $ 1,004.9 $ 1,171.8 $ 1,366.4

1 Amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 27, 2018, was approximately 4.9%.
The operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of $0.5 million.
As of May 27, 2018, we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling $68.5 million. This amount is not included in the table above. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we made a voluntary pension plan contribution in the amount of $300.0 million. We do not expect to be required to make additional payments to fund these amounts in the foreseeable future. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next

38

twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $19.6 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension plans. See Note 19 "Pension and Postretirement Benefits" to the consolidated financial statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits" contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.
As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of May 27, 2018, was as follows:

------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------- --- --------------- --- --------- --- --------- ------------ --- - - - -

 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period(in millions)
Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5Years
Standby repurchase obligations $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 $ — $ —
Other commitments 6.1 4.1 2.0 — —
Total $ 7.0 $ 4.7 $ 2.3 $ — $ —

In addition to the commitments included in the table above, as of May 27, 2018, we had $32.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 27, 2018, the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed five years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $2.6 million. In addition, we guarantee a certain lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 27, 2018, the remaining term of this arrangement does not exceed nine years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $21.7 million.
In certain limited situations, we also guarantee obligations of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to guarantee arrangements that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligations are substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Such guarantee arrangements are described below. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the "Separation Agreement"), between us and Lamb Weston, these guarantee arrangements are deemed liabilities of Lamb Weston that were transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of these guarantee arrangements, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.
Lamb Weston is a party to a warehouse services agreement with a third-party warehouse provider through July 2035. Under this agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make payments for warehouse services based on the quantity of goods stored and other service factors. We have guaranteed the warehouse provider that we will make the payments required under the agreement in the event that Lamb Weston fails to perform. Minimum payments of $1.5 million per month are required under this agreement. It is not possible to determine the maximum amount of the payment obligations under this agreement. Upon completion of the Spinoff, we recognized a liability for the estimated fair value of this guarantee. As of May 27, 2018, the amount of this guarantee, recorded in other noncurrent liabilities, was $28.1 million.
Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed Lamb Weston's performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $75.0 million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty, would be largely mitigated.
The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 27, 2018, was $32.5 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 27,

39

2018, that, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $27.8 million. Recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.
Our Audit/Finance Committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
Marketing Costs—We incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant. For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, management's estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time.
We have recognized reserves of $100.5 million for these marketing costs as of May 27, 2018. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.
Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $278.6 million, $328.3 million, and $347.2 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Income Taxes—Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 15 "Pre-tax Income and Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
Environmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. Management's estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash

40

payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
We have recognized a reserve of approximately $57.8 million for environmental liabilities as of May 27, 2018. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy.
Employment-Related Benefits—We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company has elected to use a split discount rate (the "spot-rate approach") for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans. Historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs, both of which are components of pension benefit costs. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost. This change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively. The pre-tax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately $27.0 million.
We have recognized a pension liability of $171.5 million and $582.2 million, a postretirement liability of $118.2 million and $156.9 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $39.4 million and $41.5 million, as of the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also have recognized a pension asset of $103.0 million and $17.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status.
We recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under U.S. GAAP.
We recognized pension expense (benefit), including activities of discontinued operations, from Company plans of $(56.1) million, $(12.9) million, and $370.8 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $3.4 million, $1.2 million, and $348.5 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. This also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $218.3 million, $207.4 million, and $259.9 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We contributed $312.6 million, $163.0 million, and $11.5 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $19.6 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2019.
One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. Historically, we have selected a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a high-quality corporate bond yield curve for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The corporate bond yield curve is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moody's Aa) available at the measurement date. At May 29, 2016, the Company changed to use a spot-rate approach, discussed above. This alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.
Based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 3.90% for fiscal 2018, 3.83% for fiscal 2017, and 4.10% for fiscal 2016. We selected a weighted-average discount rate of 4.21% and 3.83% for determination of service and interest expense, respectively, for fiscal 2019. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2018 would have resulted in an increase of $3.9 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2018. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2018 would have resulted in an decrease of $3.0 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2018. For our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 4.14% and 3.90% for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.

41

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 7.50% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2018 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $7.3 million.
During fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment of our salaried and non-qualified pension plans. The amendment froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in those plans. As a result of this amendment, we have changed our salaried and non-qualified pension asset investment strategy to align our related pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility. We selected a weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets of 5.17% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2019. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.2 million.
The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. Due to the amendment discussed above, this assumption is no longer applicable for any of our pension plans in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. We selected 3.63% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2018, 3.66% for fiscal 2017, and 3.70% for fiscal 2016. A 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million for the year.
In October 2016, The Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plan Experience Committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of U.S. pension plan obligations. With the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of May 28, 2017, we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables.
 During 2018, we conducted a mortality experience study and, with the assistance of our third-party actuary, adopted new company-specific mortality tables used in measuring our pension obligations as of May 27, 2018. In addition, we incorporated a revised mortality improvement scale to be used with the new company-specific mortality tables that reflects the mortality improvement inherent in these tables.
We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense (benefit) of $0.7 million, $(1.2) million, and $0.2 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $118.2 million and $156.9 million in our balance sheets as of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $16.2 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2019.
The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates (also discussed above), and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.33% for fiscal 2018, 3.18% for fiscal 2017, and 3.50% for fiscal 2016. We have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.81% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2019. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 7.87%, with the trend rate decreasing to 4.5% by 2024. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

------------------------------------------- ------------------- --- ------------------- ---- - ---- -

($ in millions) One PercentIncrease One PercentDecrease
Effect on total service and interest cost $ 0.3 $ (0.3 )
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 3.9 (3.5 )

We provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. The weighted-average discount rate used at May 27, 2018 was 2.88%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation expense or the liability.
Business Combinations, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Identifiable Intangible Assets, and Goodwill—We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment) to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. We generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair values. The estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group.
Determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.
We reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.
In assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
If we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize a "relief from royalty" methodology. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows.

43

Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.
Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.
Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering expected long term growth rates and trends). Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.
Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized. In the second step, we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we changed our reporting segments. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level (at the operating segment or one level lower, as applicable). When such a determination was made, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment analysis for each of the old and new reporting units.
We performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Canadian reporting unit within the new International reporting segment. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. We estimated the future cash flows of the Canadian reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 7.5% and 2%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. We recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. Accordingly,

44

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $139.2 million for the impairment of goodwill. The remaining goodwill balance of the Canadian reporting unit as of May 27, 2018 was $37.6 million.
As part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the Canadian reporting unit, with the assistance of the third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of a Canadian brand to be less than its carrying value. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value.
We also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit within the International reporting segment using similar methods to those described above. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We determined that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5%. Accordingly, we did not recognize an impairment of the goodwill in the Mexican reporting unit.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due to foreign exchange rates, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $43.9 million for the impairment of goodwill.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. As a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 9.0% and 3.0%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit. We recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million, equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The remaining goodwill balance of the Mexican reporting unit as of May 27, 2018 was $118.5 million.
In fiscal 2018, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. During fiscal 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $4.0 million for our HK Anderson®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands in our Grocery & Snacks segment. We also recognized an impairment charge of $0.8 million for our Aylmer® brand in our International segment.
In fiscal 2017, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. During fiscal 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $7.1 million for our Del Monte® brand and $5.5 million for our Aylmer® brand in our International segment. We also recognized impairment charges of $67.1 million for our Chef Boyardee® brand and $1.1 million for our Fiddle Faddle® brand in our Grocery & Snacks segment.
In fiscal 2016, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. During fiscal 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $50.1 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment for our Chef Boyardee® brand.
We completed the divestiture of our Private Brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we recognized charges of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the Private Brands business.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. The updated

45

standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Based on the FASB's ASU, we will apply the new revenue standard in our fiscal year 2019. Entities will have the option to adopt the ASU using either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We have concluded our assessment of the new standard and will be adopting the provisions of the ASU utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The effective date for this standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. We do not expect ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, Topic 842, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which provides amendments to current guidance to address the classifications and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides a new framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost. Companies will present all other components of net benefit cost outside a subtotal of operating income, if presented, or disclosed separately. Also, only the service cost component may be eligible for capitalization where applicable. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively for the capitalization of service cost components. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt ASU 2017-07 in our fiscal 2019. The estimated impact is a reclassification of a benefit of $80.4 million, a benefit of $55.2 million, and a charge of $303.8 million to non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements and make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. The amendments in this update better align an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and presentation of hedge results. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to early adopt this ASU at the beginning of our fiscal 2019. We do not expect ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.

1 Amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 27, 2018, was approximately 4.9%.
The operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of $0.5 million.
As of May 27, 2018, we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling $68.5 million. This amount is not included in the table above. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we made a voluntary pension plan contribution in the amount of $300.0 million. We do not expect to be required to make additional payments to fund these amounts in the foreseeable future. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next

twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $19.6 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension plans. See Note 19 "]:
Note 27--Phillips 66 Partners LP Phillips 66 Partners is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other midstream assets. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners' assets currently consist of crude oil, refined petroleum products and NGL transportation, terminaling and storage systems, as well as crude oil and NGL processing facilities. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3--Variable Interest Entities for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and perpetual convertible preferred unitholders' ownership interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of $2,314 million and $1,306 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Generally, drop down transactions to Phillips 66 Partners will eliminate in consolidation, except for third-party debt and third-party equity offerings made by Phillips 66 Partners to finance such transactions. At December 31, 2017, we owned a 55 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a 43 percent limited partner interest and 13.8 million perpetual convertible preferred units. 2017 Activities In October 2017, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners our 25 percent interests in both Dakota Access and ETCO and our 100 percent interest in MSLP. Total consideration for the transaction was $1.65 billion, which consisted of $372 million in cash at closing, the assumption of $588 million of promissory notes payable to us, the assumption of a $450 million term loan payable to a third party, and the issuance to us of common and general partner units with a fair value of $240 million.
