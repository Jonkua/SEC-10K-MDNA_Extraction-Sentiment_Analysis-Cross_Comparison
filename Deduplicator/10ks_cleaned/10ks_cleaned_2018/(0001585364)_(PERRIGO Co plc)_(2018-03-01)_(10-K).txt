Executive Overview

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013 and became the successor registrant of Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo," the "Company," "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries.

We are a leading global healthcare company, delivering value to our customers and consumers by providing Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. Founded in 1887 as a packager of home remedies, we have built a unique business model that is best described as the convergence of a fast-moving consumer goods company, a high-quality pharmaceutical manufacturing organization and a world-class supply chain network. We believe we are one of the world's largest manufacturers of over-the-counter (“OTC”) healthcare products and suppliers of infant formulas for the store brand market. We are a leading provider of branded OTC products throughout Europe, and also a leading producer of generic pharmaceutical topical products such as creams, lotions, and gels, as well as nasal sprays and injection ("extended topical") prescription drugs. We are headquartered in Ireland, and sell our products primarily in North America and Europe, as well as in other markets, including Australia, Israel and China.

Our fiscal year previously consisted of a 52- or 53-week year ending on or around June 30 of each year with each quarter ending on the Saturday closest to each calendar quarter end. Beginning on January 1, 2016, we changed our fiscal year to begin on January 1 and end on December 31 of each year. As a result of our change in year end, this report on Form 10-K discloses the results of our operations for:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• The twelve-month period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• The twelve-month period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• The twelve-month period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• The six-month period from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2015; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• The six-month period from June 29, 2014 through December 27, 2014.

Calendar-year data for 2015 was derived from our audited results for the six-month period ended December 31, 2015 and unaudited results for the fiscal quarters ended March 28, 2015 and June 27, 2015. We cut off our quarterly accounting periods on the Saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the fourth quarter ending on December 31 of each year.

Our Segments

Our reporting segments are as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consumer Healthcare Americas ("CHCA"), comprises our U.S., Mexico and Canada consumer healthcare business (OTC, contract, infant formula and animal health categories).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consumer Healthcare International ("CHCI"), comprises our branded consumer healthcare business primarily in Europe and our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel. This segment also includes our U.K. liquid licensed products business.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prescription Pharmaceuticals ("RX"), comprises our U.S. Prescription Pharmaceuticals business.

We also had two legacy operating segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and Active Pharmaceuticals business ("API") businesses, respectively, which we divested (refer to Item 8. Note 2 and Note 6). Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses. Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.

      For information on each segment, refer to Item 1. Business - Our Segments. For results by segment and geographic locations see below "Segment Results" and Item 8. Note 19. See Item 1. Business for information on our business environment and competitive landscape.

Executive Overview

Strategy

Our strategy is to deliver Quality Affordable Healthcare Products® by leveraging our global infrastructure to expand our product offerings, thereby providing new innovative products and product line extensions to existing consumers and servicing new healthcare consumers through entry into adjacent or new markets. We accomplish this strategy by investing in and continually improving all aspects of our five strategic pillars:

- -------------
• High quality;

- --------------------------
• Superior customer service;

- -------------------
• Leading innovation;

- --------------
• Best cost; and

- -----------------
• Empowered people.

We utilize shared services and Research and Development ("R&D") centers of excellence in order to help ensure consistency in our processes around the world, and to maintain focus on our five strategic pillars.

We have grown rapidly in recent years through a combination of organic growth and targeted acquisitions. We continually reinvest in our R&D pipeline and work with partners as necessary to strive to be first-to-market with new products. Our organic growth has been and will continue to be driven by successful new product launches in the CHCA, CHCI, and RX segments. Over time, we expect to continue to grow inorganically through expansion into adjacent products, product categories, and channels, as well as potentially through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets using a return on invested capital ("ROIC") metric.

Competitive Advantage

We believe our consumer facing business model is best-in-class in that it combines the unique competencies of a fast-moving consumer goods company and a pharmaceutical manufacturing company, with the supply chain breadth necessary to support customers in the markets we serve. These durable business model competencies align with our five strategic pillars and provide us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We fully integrate quality in our operational systems across all products. Our ability to manage our supply chain complexity across multiple dosage forms, formulations, and stock-keeping units, as well as acquisitions, integration, and hundreds of global partners provides value to our customers. Product development and life cycle management are at the core of our operational investments. Globally we have 28 manufacturing plants that are all in good regulatory compliance standing and have systems and structures in place to guide our continued success. Our leadership team is fully engaged in aligning all our metrics and objectives around sustainable compliance with industry associations and regulatory agencies.

Among other things, we believe the following give us a competitive advantage and provide value to our customers:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Leadership in first-to-market product development and product life cycle management;

- --------------------------------------------------
• Turn-key regulatory, and promotional capabilities;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Management of supply chain complexity and utilizing economies of scale;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Quality and cost effectiveness throughout the supply chain creating a sustainable, low-cost network; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expansive pan-European commercial infrastructure, brand-building capabilities, and a diverse product portfolio.

Restructuring

On February 21, 2017, we approved a workforce reduction plan as part of a larger cost optimization strategy across the Company, which was completed during the year. Our plan was to reduce our global workforce by approximately 750 employees, which included some actions already taken and 235 employees who had elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represented a reduction of approximately 14% of our global non-production workforce. The changes to our workforce varied by country, based on legal requirements and required consultations with works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $61.0 million of restructuring expenses (refer to Item 8. Note 18). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we executed a supply chain reorganization which continues to generate savings for both our North American and International segments.

Recent Trends and Developments

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Management has developed a strategy to: (1) implement a brand prioritization to address certain market dynamics, with an objective to balance the cost of advertising and promotional investments with expected contributions from category sales, (2) restructure the sales force in certain markets to more effectively serve customers, and (3) in-source certain product manufacturing and development. The combination of these actions is expected to improve the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduce selling costs and improve operating margins in the segment.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• As part of our previously announced strategic initiatives, management implemented improvements and evaluated the overall cost structures within our CHCI segment in the following ways:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On December 8, 2016, we announced the cancellation of the unprofitable EuroGenerics NV distribution agreement in Belgium. The year-over-year effect of the cancellation, combined with the

exit of certain OTC distribution agreements, reduced our net sales by $200.3 million in 2017, with an immaterial impact to operating income.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We made progress on our previously announced restructuring plans to right-size the Omega business due to the impact of market dynamics on sales volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $17.1 million of restructuring expense in the CHCI segment (refer to Item 8. Note 18).

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Management continues to evaluate the most effective business model for each country, aligning our sales infrastructure and actively integrating sales strategies with promotional programs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On August 25, 2017, we completed the sale of our Russian business, which was previously classified as held-for-sale, to Alvogen Pharma LLC. The total sale price was €12.7 million ($15.1 million), inclusive of an estimated working capital adjustment, which resulted in an immaterial gain in the segment (refer to Item 8. Note 2).

The combination of these actions improved the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduced selling costs and improved operating margins in the segment.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The CHCI segment has been positively impacted by market dynamics in countries such as the Nordics, Italy, and Portugal offset by softness in certain brand categories in France and Germany, as well as by unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit.

• We continue to experience a significant reduction in pricing expectations from historical levels in our RX segment due to competitive pressures. This softness in pricing is attributable to various factors, including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings, competition in specific products, and consolidation of certain customers. We expect this softness to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future, and we are forecasting a high single digit pricing decline in this segment for the year ending December 31, 2018.

Royalty rights were $78.5 million of income and $26.6 million of income for the years ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, respectively, resulting in a change in financial asset of $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion, $10.4 million, and $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, six months ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended June 27, 2015 compared to the prior year periods, respectively (refer to Item 8. Note 6 for additional information on the assumptions).

In the first quarter of 2016, a competitor's pipeline product, Ocrevus®, received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). Breakthrough therapy designation is granted when a drug is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. In June 2016, the FDA granted priority review with a target action date in December 2016. A priority review is a designation when the FDA will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The product was approved late in the first quarter of 2017. The product is expected to compete with Tysabri®, and we expected it to have a significant negative impact on the Tysabri® royalty stream. Industry analysts believe that, based on released clinical study information, Ocrevus® will compete favorably against Tysabri® in the relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis market segment due to its high efficacy and convenient dosage form.

Unallocated, Interest, Other, and Taxes

Given the new market information for Ocrevus®, we used industry analyst estimates to reduce our first ten year growth forecasts from an average growth of approximately 3.4% in the fourth calendar quarter of 2015 to an average decline of approximately minus 2.0% in the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2016. In November 2016, we announced we were evaluating strategic alternatives for the Tysabri® financial asset. As of December 31, 2016, the financial asset was adjusted based on the strategic review and sale process. These effects, combined with the change in discount rate each quarter, led to a reduction in fair value of $204.4 million, $910.8 million, $377.4 million and $1.1 billion in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively.

On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We chose the fair value option as we believe it will help investors understand the potential future cash flows we may receive associated with the two contingent milestones.

We valued the contingent milestone payments using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ("BSOPM"). Key inputs in the BSOPM are the estimated volatility and rate of return of royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma over time until payment of the contingent milestone payments is completed. Volatility and the estimated fair value of the milestones have a positive relationship such that higher volatility translates to a higher estimated fair value of the contingent milestone payments. In the valuation of contingent milestone payments performed, we assumed volatility of 30.0% and a rate of return of 8.07% as of December 31, 2017. We assess volatility and rate of return inputs quarterly by analyzing certain market volatility benchmarks and the risk associated with Royalty Pharma achieving the underlying projected royalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments decreased $42.0 million, as a result of the decrease in the estimated projected Tysabri® revenues due to the launch of Ocrevus® late in the first quarter of 2017.

In addition, payment of the contingent milestone payments is dependent on global net sales of Tysabri®. Of the $134.5 million of estimated fair valued contingent milestone payments as of December 31, 2017, $79.7 million and $54.8 million relates to the 2018 and 2020 contingent milestone payments, respectively. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2018, we will write off the $79.7 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $250.0 million and recognize income of $170.3 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write off the $54.8 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $345.2 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Global Tysabri® net sales need to exceed $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion in 2018 and 2020, respectively, in order for Royalty Pharma to receive the level of royalties needed to trigger the milestone payments owed to us. Tysabri® net sales are anticipated to decline on a global basis in 2018, compared to 2017, due to increased competition from Ocrevus®, offset by volume growth in Tysabri® international markets (refer to Item 8. Note 6).

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net was $168.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $216.6 million in the prior year. The $48.5 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was the result of the early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest expense, net was $216.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $179.1 million in the prior year. The $37.5 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to interest incurred on the debt assumed in the Omega acquisition and borrowings on our revolving credit agreements during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Unallocated, Interest, Other, and Taxes

Interest expense, net was $89.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015, compared to $56.7 million in the prior year period. The $33.2 million increase for the six months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period was due primarily to the incremental increase in borrowings resulting from the Omega acquisition, including the issuance of $1.6 billion of senior notes in November 2014 and assumed Omega debt, of which $798.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2015, as well as amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities, including $380.0 million and $300.0 million outstanding under the 2015 Revolver and 2014 Revolver, respectively, at December 31, 2015.

See the "Borrowings and Capital Resources" section below and Item 8. Note 10 for more information.

Other Expense (Income), Net

Other expense (Income), net, was $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $22.7 million in the prior year. The $32.8 million decrease was due primarily to the absence of a $22.3 million equity investment impairment, $8.2 million of favorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, and a $3.2 million reduction in equity method losses.

Other expense (Income), net, was $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $299.1 million in the prior year. The $276.4 million decrease was due primarily to the absence of the $259.8 million loss incurred in the prior year on the derivatives used to economically hedge fluctuations in the euro-denominated purchase price of the Omega and GSK Products acquisitions. The losses on the derivatives due to the changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate prior to their settlement economically offset the final settlement of the euro-denominated Omega purchase price paid on March 30, 2015.

Other expense (Income), net, was $25.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015, compared to $60.3 million in the prior year period. The $35.1 million decrease was due primarily to a $10.7 million other-than-temporary impairment of a marketable equity security, losses on equity method investments totaling $7.1 million, and a $4.8 million loss on a foreign currency derivative we entered into, to hedge against the change in the euro for the euro-denominated purchase price of the GSK Products acquisition, offset by the absence of a $64.7 million loss related to derivative activity to economically hedge fluctuations in the euro-denominated purchase price of the Omega acquisition and a gain of $12.5 million from the transfer of a rights agreement.

See Item 8. Note 8 for more information on the derivatives and Item 8. Note 7 for information on the investments.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $135.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of tender premium on debt repayments, transaction costs, write-off of deferred financing fees, and bond discounts related to the $500.0 million 3.500% senior notes due December 2021, $500.0 million 3.500% senior notes due March 2021, $400.0 million 4.900% senior notes due 2044, $800.0 million 4.000% senior notes due 2023, and $400.0 million 5.300% senior notes due 2043.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $1.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of deferred financing fees we wrote off primarily related to the prepayment of 1.300% 2016 Notes. During the six months and year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded a $0.9 million and $1.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt, respectively, which consisted of deferred financing fees we wrote off related to the undrawn tranche of certain credit facilities that we allowed to expire during the period. The $9.6 million and $10.5 million losses during the six months and year ended December 27, 2014 and June 27, 2015, respectively, consisted mainly of interest on the bridge agreement associated with financing the Omega acquisition. The $165.8 million loss recorded in the year ended June 28, 2014 consisted of make-whole payments, write-off of unamortized discounts, write-off of deferred financing fees, and interest on the bridge agreements associated with financing the Elan acquisition.

See Item 8. Note 2 for information on the Omega acquisition, and Item 8. Note 10 for information on the extinguishment of debt.

Income Taxes (Consolidated)

The effective tax rates were as follows:

----------------- - ----------------- ------ ----------------- ----------------- - ----------------- ---- - ---- -

Six Months Ended Year Ended
December 27, 2014 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017
 14.0 % (376.2 )% 103.3 % 17.2 % 57.3 %

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the valuation allowance position due to current year activity, tax law changes in the U.S., increases in unrecognized tax benefits, offset by tax law changes in Belgium.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the impact of the asset impairments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by the impairment of Omega's intangible assets, India API assets being classified as held for sale, the valuation allowance on deferred taxes and Omega transaction costs.

The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2015 was significantly higher than for the six months ended December 27, 2014 due mainly to the impairment of Omega’s intangible assets and the related impacts on the valuation allowance position, as well as our India API assets being classified as held for sale. The effective tax rate was favorably affected by a reduction in the reserves for uncertain tax liabilities in the amount of $6.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015 related to various audit resolutions.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, statutory income tax rate changes in the U.S. and Belgium impacted the effective tax rate with a reduction to U.S. income tax expense of $2.4 million and increased Belgium income tax expense by $24.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, statutory income tax rate changes, primarily in Europe, favorably impacted the effective tax rate by $27.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively (refer to Item 8. Note 14).

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations with internally generated funds, supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, management believes that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of commercial and capital market conditions on liquidity and may determine that modifications to our capital structure are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate or if favorable capital market opportunities become available.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $57.7 million in legal and consulting fees related to our defense against Mylan.

Due to the acquisition of Omega on March 30, 2015, our CHCI segment experienced strong operating cash inflow in the second quarter of 2015 and cash outflow in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to accounts payable payment structures with suppliers that increased the days outstanding in the second and fourth quarter compared to the first and third quarters. In order to establish a more sustainable cash flow pattern during the calendar year, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing into the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a program to standardize these payment terms such that the days outstanding will largely be consistent each reporting period. This program had an unfavorable impact on accounts payable and operating cash flow in these quarters.

Cash generated from investing activities totaled $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash used of $175.0 million in the prior year. The inflow in the current year was due primarily to the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, for which we received $2.2 billion in cash at closing (refer to Item 8. Note 6). In addition, we received $154.6 million in cash primarily related to the sale of our Israel API business (refer to Item 8. Note 2). The outflow in the prior year was due primarily to the acquisition of a portfolio of generic dosage forms and strengths of Retin-A® ("Tretinoin"), a topical prescription acne treatment from Mattawan Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the Generic Benzaclin™ product rights, which used $478.4 million in cash. The outflow was offset partially by proceeds from royalty rights of $353.7 million.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the decrease in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be between $90.0 million and $115.0 million related to manufacturing productivity capacity and quality/regulatory projects. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures with funds from operating cash flows.

The outflow in the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to the acquisitions of the Tretinoin Products and the Generic Benzaclin™ product rights, which used $478.4 million in cash, offset partially by $353.7 million of proceeds from royalty rights. The outflow in the prior year was due primarily to $2.9 billion used for business acquisitions, most notably Omega, as well as $304.8 million related to the cash settlement of the non-designated foreign currency derivatives we used to hedge the euro-denominated Omega and GSK Products purchase prices. See Item 8. Note 2 and Item 8. Note 8 for more information on the above-mentioned acquisitions and derivatives, respectively.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $106.2 million during year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $166.8 million in the prior year. The decrease in capital expenditures over the prior year was due primarily to several large infrastructure projects nearing completion.

During the six months ended December 27, 2014, we used $83.0 million in cash to complete the Lumara products acquisition, and $26.4 million to hedge the euro-denominated Omega purchase price, and received $175.8 million in proceeds from royalty rights (refer to Item 8. Note 2 and Item 8. Note 8 for more information on the above-mentioned acquisitions and derivatives, respectively). Capital expenditures for the six months ended December 31, 2015 totaled $77.8 million, compared to $48.0 million in the comparable prior year period.

Overdraft Facilities

We have overdraft facilities available that we use to support our cash management operations. We report any balances outstanding in "Other Financing" in Item 8, Note 10. The balance outstanding under the facilities was $6.9 million and $82.9 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and there were no balances outstanding under the facilities at December 31, 2016.

On March 30, 2015, we assumed and repaid certain overdraft facilities totaling €51.4 million ($56.0 million) with the Omega acquisition.

Accounts Receivable Factoring

We have accounts receivable factoring arrangements with non-related third-party financial institutions (the “Factors”). Pursuant to the terms of the arrangements, we sell to the Factors certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. An administrative fee per invoice is charged on the gross amount of accounts receivables assigned to the Factors, and interest is calculated at the applicable EUR LIBOR rate plus a spread. The total amount factored on a non-recourse basis and excluded from accounts receivable was $27.5 million, $50.7 million, and $64.5 million at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Revolving Credit Agreements

On December 9, 2015, our 100% owned finance subsidiary, Perrigo Finance Unlimited Company (formerly Perrigo Finance plc) ("Perrigo Finance"), entered into a $750.0 million revolving credit agreement (the "2015 Revolver"). On March 15, 2016, we used the proceeds of the long-term debt issuance described below under "2016 Notes" to repay the $750.0 million then outstanding under the 2015 Revolver and terminated the facility.

On March 30, 2015, we assumed a revolving credit facility with €500.0 million ($544.5 million) outstanding from Omega. On April 8, 2015, we repaid the €500.0 million ($539.1 million) outstanding under the assumed revolving credit facility and terminated the facility.

On December 5, 2014, Perrigo Finance entered into a $600.0 million revolving credit agreement, which increased to $1.0 billion on March 30, 2015 (the "2014 Revolver"). On March 15, 2016, we used the proceeds of the long-term debt issuance described below under "2016 Notes" to repay the $435.0 million then outstanding under the 2014 Revolver. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2014 Revolver as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

We also entered into additional amendments to the 2014 Revolver and the 2014 Term Loan on April 25, 2017 to modify provisions of such agreements necessary as a result of the correction in accounting related to the Tysabri® financial asset, as well as waivers of any default or event of default that may arise from any restatement of or deficiencies in our financial statements for the periods specified in such amendments and waivers. No default or event of default existed prior to entering into these amendments and waivers. We are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2017.

See Item 1. Note 10 for more information on all of the above debt facilities.

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings on December 31, 2017 were Baa3 (stable) and BBB- (stable) by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Rating Services, respectively.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, and changes in business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and vendor financing terms.

Contractual Obligations

Our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2017 are set forth in the following table. Some of the amounts included in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including the duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations actually paid in future periods may vary from the amounts reflected in the table (in millions).

(4) Includes amounts associated with non-qualified plans related to deferred compensation, executive retention and post employment benefits. Of this amount, we have funded $34.6 million, which is recorded in Other non-current assets on the balance sheet. These amounts are assumed payable after five years, although certain circumstances, such as termination, would require earlier payment.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Primarily includes consulting fees, legal settlements, contingent consideration obligations, restructuring accruals, insurance obligations, and electrical and gas purchase contracts, which were accrued in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2017 for all years.

We fund our U.S. qualified profit-sharing and investment plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and Internal Revenue Service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. We are committed to making the required minimum contributions, which we expect to be approximately $25.9 million over the next 12 months. Future contributions are dependent upon various factors, including employees’ eligible compensation, plan participation and changes, if any, to current funding requirements. Therefore, no amounts were included in the Contractual Obligations table above. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $501.7 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities.

Net deferred income tax liabilities were $311.5 million as of December 31, 2017. This amount is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The determination of certain amounts in our financial statements requires the use of estimates. These estimates are based upon our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances. Although the estimates are considered reasonable based on the currently available information, actual results could differ from the estimates we have used. Management considers the below accounting estimates to require the most judgment and to be the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Customer-Related Accruals and Allowances

We generally record revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped to the customer. For customers with Free on Board ("FOB") destination terms, a provision is recorded to exclude shipments estimated to be in-transit to these customers at the end of the reporting period. A sales allowance is recorded and accounts receivable are reduced as revenues are recognized for estimated losses on credit sales due to customer claims for discounts, price discrepancies, returned goods, and other items. Revenue is also reduced for any contractual customer program arrangements and related liabilities are recorded concurrently.

We maintain customer-related accruals and allowances that consist primarily of chargebacks, rebates, sales returns, shelf stock allowances, administrative fees, and other incentive programs. Some of these adjustments relate specifically to the RX segment while others relate to the CHCA and CHCI segments. The aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to RX products can exceed 50% of the segment's gross sales. In contrast, the aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to CHCA and CHCI typically do not exceed 10% of the segment's gross sales. Certain of these accruals and allowances are recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, and others are recorded as a reduction in accounts receivable.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

Chargebacks

We market and sell products directly to wholesalers, distributors, warehousing pharmacy chains, and other direct purchasing groups. We also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies, non-warehousing chains, managed care organizations, and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as ("indirect customers"). In addition, we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. These indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, we may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers. Under either arrangement, we provide chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler's invoice price. The accrual for chargebacks is based on historical chargeback experience and confirmed wholesaler inventory levels, as well as estimated sell-through levels by wholesalers to retailers. We regularly assess current pricing dynamics and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.

Medicaid Rebates

We participate in certain qualifying U.S. federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities. Medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (Medicaid) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. Medicaid reserves are based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage, contract performance, and field inventory that will be subject to a Medicaid rebate. Medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 180 days after the product is shipped, but can be billed as many as 270 days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the Medicaid participant. As a result, our Medicaid rebate provision includes an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed, and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants. Our calculation also requires other estimates, such as estimates of sales mix, to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. Our rebates are reviewed on a monthly basis against actual claims data to ensure the liability is fairly stated.

Returns and Shelf Stock Allowances

Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. The majority of our product returns are the result of product dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. The period is based on the shelf life of the products at the time of shipment. Additionally, when establishing our reserves, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional competition, and changes in formulations.

Shelf stock allowances are credits issued to reflect changes in the selling price of a product and are based upon estimates of the amount of product remaining in a customer's inventory at the time of the anticipated price change. In many cases, the customer is contractually entitled to such a credit. The allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, and estimated changes in market price.

RX Administrative Fees and Other Rebates

Consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice, rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations, and end-user customers. Settlement of rebates and fees generally may occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes, and average contract pricing.

CHCA and CHCI Rebates and Other Allowances

In the CHCA and CHCI segments, we offer certain customers a volume incentive rebate if specific levels of product purchases are made during a specified period. The accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated levels of purchasing. In addition, we have a reserve for product returns, primarily related to damaged and unsaleable products. We also have agreements with certain customers to cover promotional activities related to our products such as coupon programs, new store allowances, and product displays. The accrual for these activities is based on customer agreements and is established at the time product revenue is recognized.

Allowances for customer-related programs are generally recorded at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described above. We continually monitor product sales provisions and re-evaluate these estimates as additional information becomes available, which includes, among other things, an assessment of current market conditions, trade inventory levels, and customer product mix. We make adjustments to these provisions at the end of each reporting period to reflect any such updates to the relevant facts and circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from service and royalty arrangements, including revenues from collaborative agreements, consist primarily of royalty payments, payments for research and development services, up-front fees and milestone payments. If an arrangement requires the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or service elements, we determine whether the individual elements represent "separate units of accounting". If the separate elements meet the requirements, we recognize the revenue associated with each element separately and revenue is allocated among elements based on their relative selling prices. If the elements within a multiple deliverable arrangement are not considered separate units of accounting, the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have occurred if there are undelivered elements that are considered essential to the arrangement. To the extent such arrangements contain refund clauses triggered by non-performance or other adverse circumstances, revenue is not recognized until all contractual obligations are satisfied.

Non-refundable up-front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period. We estimate the performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement. Revenue

 87

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

associated with research and development services is recognized on a proportional performance basis over the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the agreement. Revenue resulting from the achievement of contingent milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved. Milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract.

Inventory Reserves

We maintain reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. In estimating the reserves, management considers factors such as excess or slow-moving inventories, product expiration dating, products on quality hold, current and future customer demand, and market conditions. Changes in these conditions may result in additional reserves.

Income Taxes

Our tax rate is subject to adjustment over the balance of the year due to, among other things, income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration of or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided taxes.

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in product liability, patent, commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within that range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. We have established reserves for certain of our legal matters (refer to Item 8. Note 16). We also separately record any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring.

Acquisition Accounting

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value, with limited exceptions. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the specifically identified net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired In Process Research and Development ("IPR&D") are recognized at fair value and initially characterized as indefinite-lived intangible assets, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. If the acquired net assets do not constitute a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and no goodwill is recognized. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.

The judgments made by management in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of asset acquired and liability assumed can materially impact our results of operations. As part of the valuation procedures, we typically consult an independent advisor. There are several methods that can be used to determine fair value. We typically use an income approach for valuing our specifically identifiable intangible assets by employing either a relief from royalty or multi-period excess earnings methodology. The relief from royalty method assumes that, if the acquired company did not own the intangible asset or intellectual property, it would be willing to pay a royalty for its use. The benefit of ownership of the intellectual property is valued as the relief from the royalty

 88

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

expense that would otherwise be incurred. Typically we use this method for valuing readily transferable intangible assets that have licensing appeal, such as trade names and trademarks and certain technology assets.

The multi-period excess earnings approach starts with a forecast of the net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. We typically use this method for valuing intangible assets such as developed product technology, customer relationships, product formulations, and IPR&D.

Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in one or both of these income approaches include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, adjusted for the probability of technical and marketing success;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows;

- -------------------------------------------------------
• the estimate of an appropriate market royalty rate; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry.

We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy and validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Useful life is the period over which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. We determine the useful lives of intangible assets based on a number of factors, such as legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life, and the effects of obsolescence, anticipated demand, existence or absence of competition, and other economic factors on useful life.

Financial Assets

We accounted for the Tysabri® royalty stream as a financial asset and elected to use the fair value option model. We made the election to account for the Tysabri® financial asset using the fair value option as we believed this method was most appropriate for an asset that did not have a par value, a stated interest stream, or a termination date. The change in estimated fair value from investments in royalty rights is presented on our Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption, "Change in financial assets."

We were entitled to quarterly payments of royalties on Tysabri® sales. We recorded our right to royalty payments from Biogen when earned and when collection was reasonably assured. We recorded the change in fair value of the Tysabri® financial asset in our financial statements each period. Critical estimates in determining the fair value are the underlying revenue assumptions of Tysabri® sales and the discount rates. The revenue assumptions were impacted by product demand and market growth assumptions, inventory target levels, product approval and pricing assumptions. Factors that could cause a change in estimates of future cash flows include a change in estimated market size, entry of a competitive product that would erode market share, manufacturing and approval of a biosimilar equivalent product, a change in pricing strategy or reimbursement coverage, a delay in obtaining regulatory approval, a change in dosage of the product, and a change in the number of treatments.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

The Tysabri® financial asset acquired in 2013 as part of the Elan acquisition represented a single unit of accounting. The fair value of the financial asset acquired was determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis related to the expected future cash flows to be generated by the royalty stream from Biogen based on the royalty percentage payments of Tysabri® sales. The financial asset is classified as a Level 3 asset within the fair value hierarchy, as our valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs, including industry analyst estimates for global Tysabri® sales, probability weighted as to the timing and amount of future cash flows along with certain discount rate assumptions. Cash flow forecasts included the estimated effect and timing of future competition, considering patents in effect for Tysabri® through 2024 and contractual rights to receive cash flows into perpetuity. The discounted cash flows are based upon the expected royalty stream forecasted into perpetuity using a 20-year discrete period with a declining rate terminal value. The pre-tax discount rate utilized was 7.72% and 7.83% at December 31, 2015, and June 27, 2015, respectively. Significant judgment is required in selecting appropriate discount rates.     At December 31, 2015, and June 27, 2015, we performed an evaluation to assess the discount rate and general market conditions potentially affecting the fair value of our Tysabri® financial asset. As of December 31, 2015, had this discount rate increased or decreased by 0.5%, the fair value of the asset would have increased by $270.0 million or decreased by $260.0 million, respectively. As of June 27, 2015, had this discount rate increased or decreased by 0.5%, the fair value of the asset would have decreased by $260.0 million or increased by $290.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the asset is subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from those estimates. Quarterly, we assess the expected future cash flows and to the extent such payments are greater or less than initial estimates, or the timing of such payments is materially different than the original estimates, we will adjust the estimated fair value of the asset. As of December 31, 2015, if the expected royalty cash flows used in the estimation process had increased or decreased by 5.0%, the fair value of the asset would have increased by $270.0 million or decreased by $280.0 million, respectively. As of June 27, 2015, if the expected royalty cash flows used in the estimation process had increased or decreased by 5.0%, the fair value of the asset would have increased by $280.0 million or decreased by $280.0 million, respectively. In November 2016, we announced we were evaluating strategic alternatives for the Tysabri® financial asset. As of December 31, 2016, the financial asset was adjusted based on this strategic review and sale process, see discussion below for additional information on the sale.

The following table summarizes the change in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Tysabri® financial asset, which includes our fair value adjustment that is a Level 3 measurement under ASC 820 and is included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and the six months ended December 31, 2015 (in millions):

On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million transaction, the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We chose the fair value option as we believe it will help investors understand the potential future cash flows we may receive associated with the two contingent milestones.

 90

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

We valued the contingent milestone payments using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ("BSOPM"). Key inputs in the BSOPM are the estimated volatility and rate of return of royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma over time until payment of the contingent milestone payments is completed. Volatility and the estimated fair value of the milestones have a positive relationship such that higher volatility translates to a higher estimated fair value of the contingent milestone payments. In the valuation of contingent milestone payments performed, we assumed volatility of 30.0% and a rate of return of 8.07% as of December 31, 2017. We assess volatility and rate of return inputs quarterly by analyzing certain market volatility benchmarks and the risk associated with Royalty Pharma achieving the underlying projected royalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments decreased $42.0 million, as a result of the decrease in the estimated projected Tysabri® revenues due to the launch of Ocrevus® late in the first quarter of 2017.

In addition, payment of the contingent milestone payments is dependent on global net sales of Tysabri®. Of the $134.5 million of estimated fair valued contingent milestone payments as of December 31, 2017, $79.7 million and $54.8 million relates to the 2018 and 2020 contingent milestone payments, respectively. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2018, we will write off the $79.7 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $250 million and recognize income of $170.3 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write off the $54.8 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $345.2 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Global Tysabri® net sales need to exceed $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion in 2018 and 2020, respectively in order for Royalty Pharma to receive the level of royalties needed to trigger the milestone payments owed to us. Tysabri® net sales are anticipated to decline on a global basis in 2018, compared to 2017, due to increased competition from Ocrevus®, offset by volume growth in Tysabri® international markets (refer to Item 8. Note 6).

The table below presents a reconciliation for the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions). Change in fair value in the table was recorded in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents amounts paid for an acquisition in excess of the fair value of net assets received. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists (refer to Item 8. Note 1). Effective in the year ended December 31, 2016, we changed our segment structure. We performed our annual goodwill testing as of October 1, 2017, the first day of the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples. The estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows that include assumptions about future performance. The discount rates used in testing each of our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment as of our annual testing date in the fourth quarter of 2017 are based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of the Company’s reporting units and ranged from 7.5% to 13.5%. Perpetual growth rates for each reporting unit ranged from 2.0% to 3.0%. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss.

 91

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

During our annual goodwill testing as of October 1, 2017, we determined the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their net book values. The fair values of the BCH, UK AUS, and Animal Health reporting units were each less than 25.0% higher than their respective net book values. As a result, these reporting units are inherently at a higher risk for future impairments if they experience deterioration in business performance or market multiples, or increases in discount rates. These reporting units had the following remaining goodwill balances as of December 31, 2017:

-------------- ------------------------------------ ------- ------- -------------------------------------- -----

Reporting Unit Goodwill Remaining in Reporting Unit Segment Fair Value in excess of Carrying Value
BCH $ 1,026.0 CHCI 6.6%
Animal Health $ 178.9 CHCA 23.6%
UK AUS $ 53.1 CHCI 18.3%

The discounted cash flow forecasts used for these reporting units in goodwill impairment testing include assumptions about future activity levels in the near term and longer-term. If growth in these reporting units is lower than expected, we may experience deterioration in our cash flow forecasts that may indicate goodwill in the reporting units may be impaired in future impairment tests. We continue to monitor the progress and assess the reporting units for potential impairment should impairment indicators arise, as applicable, and at least annually during our fourth quarter impairment testing.

Management performed sensitivity analyses on the discounted cash flow valuations that were prepared to estimate the enterprise values of each reporting unit. Discount rates were increased and decreased by increments of 50 basis points, up to cumulative increases and decreases of 150 basis points. Perpetual revenue growth rates were increased and decreased by increments of 50 basis points, up to cumulative increases and decreases of 100 basis points. A summary of the sensitivity analysis results is provided below for the three reporting units for which estimated fair value was less than 25.0% higher than net book value.

BCH

A 50 basis point increase in the discount rate, a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, or different combinations thereof, would indicate potential impairment for this reporting unit. Based on the sensitivity of the discount rate assumption on the BCH reporting unit analysis, any increase in the discount rate over the next twelve months could negatively impact the estimated fair value of this reporting unit and lead to a future impairment. Certain macroeconomic factors which are not controlled by the reporting unit, such as rising inflation or interest rates, could cause an increase in the discount rate to occur. Deterioration in BCH performance over the next twelve months, such as lower than expected revenues or profitability that has a sustained impact on future periods, could also represent potential indicators of impairment requiring further impairment analysis.

Animal Health

A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, or a 150 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with 50 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment of this reporting unit. If the expected results for this reporting unit are not achieved, potential indicators of impairment may result, requiring further analysis.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Animal Health reporting unit had an indication of potential impairment resulting from the termination of a supply agreement. We prepared an impairment test as of December 31, 2017 and determined the fair value of the Animal Health reporting unit continued to exceed net book value, by 8.9%. The 8.9% margin was lower than the excess fair value over carrying value of 23.6% that was estimated as of October 1, 2017. Therefore, while no impairment was recorded in 2017, the supply agreement termination increased the risk of future impairment in this reporting unit. Based on our estimates of fair value and the reported carrying values as of December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment of this reporting unit. If the expected results for this reporting unit are not achieved, additional indicators of impairment may result, requiring further analysis.

 92

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

UK AUS

A 150 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment of this reporting unit. If the expected results for this reporting unit are not achieved, potential indicators of impairment may result, requiring further analysis.

The sensitivity analyses described above for BCH, UK AUS, and Animal Health, while a useful tool, should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate.

Certain trade names, trademarks, brands, as well as IPR&D assets, are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization. We review them for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that any individual asset might be impaired, and adjust the carrying value of the asset as necessary. IPR&D assets are initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. We recorded the following impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

---------------------------------- ----------------- ---- ----------------- ----------------- ------- - -----

 Year Ended Six Months Ended
 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015
Goodwill $ — $ 1,092.6 $ —
Indefinite-lived intangible assets $ — $ 849.5 $ 185.1
IPR&D $ 12.7 $ 3.5 $ —

As of December 31, 2017, the remaining goodwill and indefinite-lived asset balances are $4.2 billion and $90.3 million, respectively (refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for additional information regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing results and assumptions used, respectively).

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets

Definite-lived intangible assets consist of a portfolio of developed product technology/formulation and product rights, distribution and license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and certain trademarks, trade names, and brands. The assets are amortized on either a straight-line basis or proportionately to the benefits derived from those relationships or agreements.

For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We recorded the following impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

-------------------------------- ----------------- ---- ----------------- - -----

 Year Ended
 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
Definite-lived Intangible assets $ 19.7 $ 665.5

To the extent we experience additional unanticipated competitive market entrants or major adverse macro-economic events, we may incur additional impairment losses (refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for a more detailed discussion of the impaired definite-lived intangible assets and assumptions used, respectively).

Guaranteed Liabilities

On November 21, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business, which was previously classified as held-for-sale, to SK Capital (refer to Item 8. Note 2). As a result of the sale, we recognized a guarantee liability. Per the agreement, we will be reimbursed for tax receivables for tax years prior to closing and will need to reimburse SK Capital for the settlement of any uncertain tax liability positions for tax years prior to closing. In addition, after closing and going forward, the Israel API business, will be assessed by and liable to the Israel Tax Authority ("ITA") for any audit findings. We are no longer the primary obligor on the liabilities transferred to SK Capital on November 21, 2017, however, we have provided a guarantee on certain obligations that were recorded at a fair value of $13.8 million, with a maximum possible payout of $34.9 million.

In addition, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $57.7 million in legal and consulting fees related to our defense against Mylan.

Due to the acquisition the calendar year, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing into the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a program to standardize these payment terms such that the days outstanding will largely be consistent each reporting period.

The allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, and estimated changes in market price.

RX Administrative Fees and Other Rebates

Consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice, rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations, and end-user customers. Settlement of rebates and fees generally may occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes, and average contract pricing.

Critical Accounting Estimates

CHCA and CHCI Rebates and Other Allowances

In the CHCA and CHCI segments, we offer certain customers a volume incentive rebate if specific levels of product purchases are made during a specified period. The accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated levels of purchasing. In addition, we have a reserve for product returns, primarily related to damaged and unsaleable products. We also have agreements with certain customers to cover promotional activities related to our products such as coupon programs, new store allowances, and product displays. The accrual for these activities is based on customer agreements and is established at the time product revenue is recognized.

Allowances for customer-related programs are generally recorded at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described above. We continually monitor product sales provisions and re-evaluate these estimates as additional information becomes available, which includes, among other things, an assessment of current market conditions, trade inventory levels, and customer product mix. We make adjustments to these provisions at the end of each reporting period to reflect any such updates to the relevant facts and circumstances.

[") are recognized at fair value and initially characterized as indefinite-lived intangible assets, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. If the acquired net assets do not constitute a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and no goodwill is recognized. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.

The judgments made by management in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of asset acquired and liability assumed can materially impact our results of operations. As part of the valuation procedures, we typically consult an independent advisor. There are several methods that can be used to determine fair value. We typically use an income approach for valuing our specifically identifiable intangible assets by employing either a relief from royalty or multi-period excess earnings methodology. The relief from royalty method assumes that, if the acquired company did not own the intangible asset or intellectual property, it would be willing to pay a royalty for its use. The benefit of ownership of the intellectual property is valued as the relief from the royalty

expense that would otherwise be incurred. Typically we use this method for valuing readily transferable intangible assets that have licensing appeal, such as trade names and trademarks and certain technology assets.

The multi-period excess earnings approach starts with a forecast of the net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. We typically use this method for valuing intangible assets such as developed product technology, customer relationships, product formulations, and IPR&D.

Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in one or both of these income approaches include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, adjusted for the probability of technical and marketing success;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products;

• the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

Restructuring

On February 21, 2017, we approved a workforce reduction plan as part of a larger cost optimization strategy across the Company, which was completed during the year. Our plan was to reduce our global workforce by approximately 750 employees, which included some actions already taken and 235 employees who had elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represented a reduction of approximately 14% of our global non-production workforce. The changes to our workforce varied by country, based on legal requirements and required consultations with works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $61.0 million of restructuring expenses (refer to Item 8. Note 18). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we executed a supply chain reorganization which continues to generate savings for both our North American and International segments.

We were entitled to quarterly payments of royalties on Tysabri® sales. We recorded our right to royalty payments from Biogen when earned and when collection was reasonably assured. We recorded the change in fair value of the Tysabri® financial asset in our financial statements each period. Critical estimates in determining the fair value are the underlying revenue assumptions of Tysabri® sales product, a change in pricing strategy or reimbursement coverage, a delay in obtaining regulatory approval, a change in dosage of the product, and a change in the number of treatments.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

The Tysabri® financial asset acquired in 2013 as part of the Elan acquisition represented a single unit of accounting. The fair value of the financial asset Tysabri® sales. The financial asset is classified as a Level 3 asset within the fair value hierarchy, as our valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs, including industry analyst estimates for global Tysabri® sales, probability weighted as to the timing and amount of future cash flows along with certain discount rate assumptions. Cash flow forecasts included the estimated effect and timing of future competition, considering patents in effect for Tysabri® through 2024 and contractual rights to receive cash flows into perpetuity. The discounted cash flows are based upon the expected royalty stream forecasted into perpetuity using a 20-year discrete period with a declining rate terminal value. The pre-tax discount rate utilized was 7.72% and 7.83% at December 31, 2015, and June 27, 2015, respectively. Significant judgment is required in selecting appropriate discount rates.     At December 31, 2015, and June 27, 2015, we performed an evaluation to assess the discount rate and general market conditions potentially affecting the fair value of our Tysabri® financial asset. As of December 31, 2015, had this discount rate increased or decreased by 0.5%, the fair value of the asset would have $260.0 million or increased by $290.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the asset is subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from those estimates. Quarterly, we assess the expected future cash flows and to the extent such payments are greater or less than initial estimates, or the timing of such payments is materially different than the original estimates, we will adjust the estimated fair value of the asset. As of December 31, 2015, if the expected royalty cash flows used in the estimation process had increased or decreased by 5.0%, the fair value of the asset would have increased by $270.0 million or decreased by $280.0 million, respectively. As of June 27, 2015, if the expected royalty cash flows used in the estimation process had increased or decreased by 5.0%, the fair value of the asset would have increased by $280.0 million or decreased by $280.0 million, respectively. In November 2016, we announced we were evaluating strategic alternatives for the Tysabri® financial asset. As of December 31, 2016, the financial asset was adjusted based on this strategic review and sale process, see discussion below for additional information on the sale.

The following table summarizes the change in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Tysabri® financial asset, which includes our fair value adjustment that is a Level 3 measurement under ASC 820 and is included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and the six months ended December 31, 2015 (in millions):

Change in Financial Assets

On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain during the three months ended April 1, 2017. We elected to account for the contingent milestone payments using the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We chose the fair value option as we believe it will help investors understand the potential future cash flows we may receive associated with the two contingent milestones.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

We valued the contingent milestone payments using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ("]:
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary

["). Key inputs in the BSOPM are the estimated volatility and rate of return of royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma over time until payment of the contingent milestone payments is completed. Volatility and the estimated fair value of the milestones have a positive relationship such that higher volatility translates to a higher estimated fair value of the contingent milestone payments. In the valuation of contingent milestone payments performed, we assumed volatility of 30.0% and a rate of return of 8.07% as of December 31, 2017. We assess volatility and rate of return inputs quarterly by analyzing certain market volatility benchmarks and the risk associated with Royalty Pharma achieving the underlying projected royalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments decreased $42.0 million, as a result of the decrease in the estimated projected Tysabri® revenues due to the launch of Ocrevus® late in the first quarter of 2017.

In addition, payment of the contingent milestone payments is dependent on global net sales of Tysabri®. Of the $134.5 million of estimated fair valued contingent milestone payments as of December 31, 2017, $79.7 million and $54.8 million relates to the 2018 and 2020 contingent milestone payments, respectively. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2018, we will write off the $79.7 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $250 million and recognize income of $170.3 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If Tysabri® global net sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write off the $54.8 million asset as an expense to Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will write up the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $345.2 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Global Tysabri® net sales need to exceed $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion in 2018 and 2020, respectively in order for Royalty Pharma to receive the level of royalties needed to trigger the milestone payments owed to us. Tysabri® net sales are anticipated to decline on a global basis in 2018, compared to 2017, due to increased competition from Ocrevus®, offset by volume growth in Tysabri® international markets (refer to Item 8. Note 6).

The table below presents a reconciliation for the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions).

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents amounts paid for an acquisition in excess of the fair value of net assets received. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists (refer to Item 8. Note 1). Effective in the year ended December 31, 2016, we changed our segment structure. We performed our annual goodwill testing as of October 1, 2017, the first day of the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples. The estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows that include assumptions about future performance. The discount rates used in testing each of our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment as of our annual testing date in the fourth quarter of 2017 are based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of the Company’s reporting units and ranged from 7.5% to 13.5%. Perpetual growth rates for each reporting unit ranged from 2.0% to 3.0%. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss.

During our annual goodwill testing as of October 1, 2017, we determined the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their net book values. The fair values of the BCH, UK AUS, and Animal Health reporting units were each less than 25.0% higher than their respective net book values. As a result, these reporting units are inherently at a higher risk for future impairments if they experience deterioration in business performance or market multiples, or increases in discount rates. These reporting units had the following remaining goodwill balances as of December 31, 2017:

-------------- ------------------------------------ ------- ------- -------------------------------------- -----

Reporting Unit Goodwill Remaining in Reporting Unit Segment Fair Value in excess of Carrying Value
BCH $ 1,026.0 CHCI 6.6%
Animal Health $ 178.9 CHCA 23.6%
UK AUS $ 53.1 CHCI 18.3%

The discounted cash flow forecasts used for these reporting units in goodwill impairment testing include assumptions about future activity levels in the near term and longer-term. If growth in these reporting units is lower than expected, we may experience deterioration in our cash flow forecasts that may indicate goodwill in the reporting units may be impaired in future impairment tests. We continue to monitor the progress and assess the reporting units for potential impairment should impairment indicators arise, as applicable, and at least annually during our fourth quarter impairment testing.

Management performed sensitivity analyses on the discounted cash flow valuations that were prepared to estimate the enterprise values of each reporting unit. Discount rates were increased and decreased by increments of 50 decreases of 100 basis points. A summary of the sensitivity analysis results is provided below for the three reporting units for which estimated fair value was less than 25.0% higher than net book value.

BCH

A 50 basis point increase in the discount rate, a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, or different combinations thereof, would indicate potential impairment for this reporting unit. Based on the sensitivity of the discount rate assumption on the BCH reporting unit analysis, any increase in the discount rate over the next twelve months could negatively impact the estimated fair value of this reporting unit and lead to a future impairment. Certain macroeconomic factors which are not controlled by the reporting unit, such as rising inflation or interest rates, could cause an increase in the discount rate to occur. Deterioration in BCH performance over the next twelve months, such as lower than expected revenues or profitability that has a sustained impact on future periods, could also represent potential indicators of impairment requiring further impairment analysis.

Animal Health

A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, or a 150 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with 50 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment of this reporting unit. If the expected results for this reporting unit are not achieved, potential indicators of impairment may result, requiring further analysis.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Animal Health reporting unit had an indication of potential impairment resulting from the termination of a supply agreement. We prepared an impairment test as of December 31, 2017 and determined the fair value of the Animal Health reporting unit continued to exceed net book value, by 8.9%. The 8.9% margin was lower than the excess fair value over carrying value of 23.6% that was estimated as of October 1, 2017. Therefore, while no impairment was recorded in 2017, the supply agreement termination increased the risk of future impairment in this reporting unit. Based on our estimates of fair value and the reported carrying values as of December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth

UK AUS

A 150 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment of this reporting unit. If the expected results for this reporting unit are not achieved, potential indicators of impairment may result, requiring further analysis.

The sensitivity analyses described above for BCH, UK AUS, and Animal Health, while a useful tool, should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate.

Certain trade names, trademarks, brands, as well as IPR&D assets, are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization. We review them for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that any individual asset might be impaired, and adjust the carrying value of the asset as necessary. IPR&D assets are initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. We recorded the following impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

---------------------------------- ----------------- ---- ----------------- ----------------- ------- - -----

 Year Ended Six Months Ended

Goodwill $ — $ 1,092.6 $ —
Indefinite-lived intangible assets $ — $ 849.5 $ 185.1
IPR&D $ 12.7 $ 3.5 $ —

As of December 31, 2017, the remaining goodwill and indefinite-lived asset balances are $4.2 billion and $90.3 million, respectively (refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for additional information regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing results and assumptions used, respectively).

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets

Definite-lived intangible assets consist of a portfolio of developed product technology/formulation and product rights, distribution and license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and certain trademarks, trade names, and brands. The assets are amortized on either a straight-line basis or proportionately to the benefits derived from those relationships or agreements.

For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We recorded the following impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

-------------------------------- ----------------- ---- ----------------- - -----

 Year Ended
 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
Definite-lived Intangible assets $ 19.7 $ 665.5

To the extent we experience additional unanticipated competitive market entrants or major adverse macro-economic events, we may incur additional impairment losses (refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for a more detailed discussion of the impaired definite-lived intangible assets and assumptions used, respectively).
