Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. Our discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report.

Management Overview

We generated diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) of $6.42 during 2017 compared to $6.20 for 2016. Comparable store sales were down 2.0% in 2017. The lower than expected sales performance was driven by the following factors:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Short-term disruptions resulting from our transformation actions taken in 2017;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• Macroeconomic pressures on the automotive aftermarket industry; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Weather-related impacts in our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and North Central markets.

The softness in the industry over the last year resulted from higher gas prices and a significantly lower number of new cars sold during 2008 and 2009 resulting in an abnormal trough of vehicles of that age and their typical parts, maintenance items and accessories needs. Our analysis shows that short-term volatility is not unusual in the industry. We have completed a number of transformation actions in 2017, including the restructuring and reduction in the number of Advance Auto Parts (“AAP”) and Carquest US (“CQUS”) store regions, implementation of improved pricing discipline in our stores and reduction in inventory. While we believe these actions are needed for the long term, there were some short-term disruption impacts during the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Despite stronger performance in our Western and Southern markets, we experienced softness in our cooling parts and chemicals category sales across many of our other markets as a result of the milder summer weather. Partially offsetting the softness in our AAP/CQUS business was the performance of certain aspects of our Professional and Canadian businesses, which grew their sales during the year, as well as an increased demand in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from more favorable winter weather.

Our operating profit margin reflects deliberate choices to invest in our business and improve productivity over the long term despite the sales softness. We believe these investments are necessary as we build a foundation for sustainable, long-term performance improvement.

When adjusted for the following non-operational items, our adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) in 2017 was $5.37 compared to $7.15 during 2016:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating income for 2017 was $570.2 million, a decrease of $217.4 million from 2016. As a percentage of total sales, operating income was 6.1%, a decrease of 215 basis points as compared to 2016, due to a decrease in comparable store sales and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Inventories as of December 30, 2017 decreased $157.4 million, or 3.6%, from inventories as of December 31, 2016. This decrease was driven by our inventory optimization efforts.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We generated operating cash flow of $600.8 million million during 2017, an increase of 14.8% compared to 2016, primarily due to a decrease in inventory levels generated by the focus on inventory optimization across the Company.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Provision for income taxes decreased $234.5 million to $44.8 million in 2017 as compared to $279.2 million in 2016 primarily due to a net $143.8 million of one-time benefits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.

Refer to “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further details of our income statement and cash flow results.

Business Update

We continue to make progress on the various elements of our strategic business plan, which is focused on improving the customer experience and driving consistent execution for both Professional and DIY customers. To achieve these improvements, we have undertaken planned transformation actions to help build a foundation for long-term success across the entire company. These transformation actions initiated during 2017 include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A continued roll-out of our common catalog across all four banners - Advance Auto Parts, Carquest, Worldpac and Autopart International. This expanded catalog leverages our enterprise-wide assortment to all of our customers and will be fully enabled through each banner’s point-of-sale system. This capability also provides the customer more flexibility in originating orders across banners.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Development of a demand-driven assortment, leveraging purchase history and look-ups from the common catalog, versus our existing push-down supply approach. This technology is a first step in moving from a supply-driven to a demand-driven assortment.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Progression in the early development of a more efficient end-to-end supply chain to deliver our broad assortment.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expanded use of Telematics, a fleet management and tracking platform, that is critical for real-time fleet management and accurate measurement and management of customer order and delivery commitments.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Creation of new DIY omni-channel capabilities to reach our customers in the manner that is most desirable for them, including the launch of our enhanced website during the third quarter and eventual launch of a mobile app.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Entered into a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries where Advance Auto Parts and Carquest stores will be the only retailer in the nation to carry a complete range of Interstate Batteries in store and online.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Acceleration of Worldpac branch openings to drive Professional growth while investing in online and digital to drive DIY improvements.

Industry Update

Operating within the automotive aftermarket industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors, many of which are similar to those affecting the overall retail industry. These factors include, but are not limited to:

- ----------
• Fuel costs

- ------------------
• Unemployment rates

- -------------------
• Consumer confidence

- -----------
• Competition

- -------------------------------------------
• Reduction in new car sales in 2008 and 2009

2017 Compared to 2016

Net Sales

Net sales for 2017 were $9,373.8 million, a decline of $193.9 million, or 2.0%, from net sales in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline of 2.0%. During 2017, we consolidated 16 stores and closed 50 stores, which was partially offset by the opening of 60 new stores. Our decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decrease in overall transactions in 2017 and mild summer weather conditions, which was partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value and favorable weather in the fourth quarter of the year that drove a stronger demand across the business.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for 2017 was $4,085.0 million, or 43.6% of net sales, as compared to $4,255.9 million, or 44.5% of net sales, in 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by unfavorable commodity prices and the negative impact related to the continued inventory optimization efforts, partially offset by continued material cost improvement.

SG&A

SG&A for 2017 were $3,514.8 million, or 37.5% of net sales, as compared to $3,468.3 million, or 36.3% of net sales, for 2016, an increase of 125 basis points. This increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the continued transformation plan and higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and higher medical costs. Partially offsetting these costs were lower GPI integration, store closure and consolidation costs and expenses in 2017 compared to the prior year and continued focus on expense management throughout the year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for 2017 was $58.8 million, as compared to $59.9 million in 2016. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower outstanding balances of our credit facilities during 2017, as compared to 2016.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2017 was $44.8 million, as compared to $279.2 million for 2016. Our effective income tax rate was 8.6% and 37.8% for 2017 and 2016. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to a net $143.8 million benefit related to the Act. Refer to discussion in Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information relating to impact of the Act in 2017.

2016 Compared to 2015

Net Sales

Net sales for 2016 were $9,567.7 million, a decline of $169.3 million, or 1.7%, over net sales for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline of 1.4% and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated. During 2016, we consolidated 159 stores and closed 23 stores, which was partially offset by the opening of 78 new stores. Our decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in overall transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value. While the number of comparable store transactions decreased from the comparable period in all four quarters of 2016, we saw improving trends in the second half of the year.

Our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by challenges with product availability and service levels, particularly in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. On a quarterly basis our comparable store sales decreased 1.9%, 4.1% and 1.0% in the first, second and third quarters of 2016 and increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. We attribute the improvement in our comparable store sales in the last half of the year to our efforts to improve our focus on the customer, including sustained investments in availability, customer service and incentives for front line employees, as well as improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain. We also benefited in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the timing of the Christmas and New Years holidays.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for 2016 was $4,255.9 million, or 44.5% of net sales, as compared to $4,422.8 million, or 45.4% of net sales, in 2015, a decrease of 94 basis points. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by significantly higher inventory levels in the first half of 2016 and disruption in our distributions centers located in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets resulting from changes in delivery frequency.

SG&A

SG&A for 2016 was $3,468.3 million, or 36.3% of net sales, as compared to $3,597.0 million, or 36.9% of net sales, for 2015, a decrease of 69 basis points. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower GPI integration, store closure and consolidation and support center restructuring costs in 2016 compared to the prior year. Excluding these costs, SG&A decreased 14 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs partially offset by higher customer facing costs, including store labor and incentives and inventory availability support costs.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2016 was $787.6 million, representing 8.2% of net sales, as compared to $825.8 million, or 8.5% of net sales, for 2015, a decrease of 25 basis points. This decrease was due to a lower gross profit rate, partially offset by a decrease in our SG&A rate. These changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and SG&A drivers previously discussed.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for 2016 was $59.9 million, as compared to $65.4 million in 2015. The decrease in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2016 was $279.2 million, as compared to $279.5 million for 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 37.8% and 37.1% for 2016 and 2015. Our income tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to $7.8 million of settlements recorded in 2016 related to income tax audits of GPI for time periods prior to our acquisition of GPI. These settlements were largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with GPI and therefore recorded corresponding income of $7.3 million in Other Income, net.

Net Income

Net income was $459.6 million, or $6.20 per diluted share, for 2016 as compared to $473.4 million, or $6.40 per diluted share, for 2015. As a percentage of net sales, net income for 2016 was 4.8%, as compared to 4.9% for 2015. The decrease in diluted EPS was driven primarily by the decrease in net income.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude (1) non-operational expenses associated with the integration of GPI and store closure and consolidation costs; (2) non-cash charges related to the acquired GPI intangibles; (3) transformation expenses under our strategic business plan; and (4) nonrecurring impact of the Act, is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size, nature and significance and/or relate to the integration of GPI and store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels. These measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry. The disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation. Included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the GAAP measures.

GPI Integration Expenses—We acquired GPI for $2.08 billion in 2014 and are in the midst of a multi-year plan to integrate the operations of GPI with AAP. This includes the integration of product brands and assortments, supply chain and information technology. The integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years. The integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015, which our focus then shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems. Due to the size of the acquisition, we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business. Therefore, we believe providing additional information in the form of non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is complete.

Store Closure and Consolidation Expenses—Store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with our plans to convert and consolidate the Carquest stores acquired from GPI. The conversion and consolidation of the Carquest stores is a multi-year process that began in 2014. As of December 30, 2017, 346 Carquest stores acquired from GPI had been consolidated into existing AAP stores and 422 stores had been converted to the AAP format. While periodic store closures are common, these closures represent a major program outside of our typical market evaluation process. We believe it is useful to provide additional non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance. We also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our non-GAAP measures.

Transformation Expenses—We expect to recognize a significant amount of transformation expenses over the next several years as we transition from integration of our AAP/CQUS businesses to a plan that involves a more holistic and integrated transformation of the entire Company across all four banners, including Worldpac and AI. These expenses will include, but not be limited to, restructuring costs, third-party professional services and other significant costs to integrate and streamline our operating structure across the enterprise. We focused our initial transformation efforts on our AAP/CQUS field structure in the second quarter and are reviewing other areas throughout the Company, such as supply chain and information technology.

U.S. Tax Reform—On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. The Act amends the Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the reduction to the corporate tax rate, which is effective on January 1, 2018, the Company is required to re-value deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period of enactment. The Company also recorded an estimated charge to income tax expense for the nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and it is the Company’s intention to bring back the accumulated foreign earnings held as cash in the near term.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits, inventory purchases, contractual obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan. In addition, we may use available funds for acquisitions, to repay borrowings under our credit agreement, to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends. Historically, we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed. We believe funds generated from our expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next year.

Capital Expenditures

Our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development (leased and owned locations), maintenance of existing stores, and investments in supply chain and information technology. We lease approximately 84% of our stores. Our capital expenditures were $189.8 million in 2017, a decrease of $69.8 million from 2016. This decrease in capital expenditures was due to disciplined capital spending by the Company to focus on priority projects in an effort to optimize cash flow for 2017.

Our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new store development (leased and owned locations) within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores, information technology and supply chain network. In 2018, we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will be up to $250 million, but may vary with business conditions.

Analysis of Cash Flows

The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:

---------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ----- ----------------- ------ --------------- ----- ------ - - ----- -

 Year Ended
(in millions) December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 January 2, 2016
Cash flows from operating activities $ 600.8 $ 523.3 $ 702.6
Cash flows from investing activities (178.6 ) (262.0 ) (253.4 )
Cash flows from financing activities (14.9 ) (217.1 ) (459.0 )
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 4.5 0.3 (4.2 )
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 411.8 $ 44.4 $ (13.9 )

Operating Activities

For 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased $77.5 million to $600.8 million. This net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of payments within working capital. Our inventory balance as of December 30, 2017 decreased $157.4 million, or 3.6%, over the prior year primarily driven by the focus on inventory optimization across the Company.

For 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $179.3 million to $523.3 million. This net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable, lower net income and the timing of payments within working capital, partially offset by the timing of income tax deductions. Our inventory balance as of December 31, 2016 increased $151.1 million, or 3.6%, over the prior year driven mainly by the build-up of transitional inventory associated with our Carquest product and store integration and the opening of new locations, including a new Worldpac distribution center.

Investing Activities

For 2017, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $83.4 million to $178.6 million compared to 2016. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment.

For 2016, net cash used in investing activities increased by $8.7 million to $262.0 million compared to 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used for purchases of property and equipment.

Financing Activities

For 2017, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $202.2 million to $14.9 million. This decrease was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year.

For 2016, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $241.9 million to $217.1 million. This decrease was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year.

Long-Term Debt

For detailed information refer to Note 7, Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

As of December 30, 2017, we had a credit rating from Standard & Poor’s of BBB- and from Moody’s Investor Service of Baa2. The current outlooks by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are both stable. The current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings. If these credit ratings decline, our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited. In addition, it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby third-party institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating, which could result in increased working capital requirements. Conversely, if these credit ratings improve, our interest rate may decrease.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of December 30, 2017, other than as disclosed in Note 7, Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, we had no other off-balance-sheet arrangements. We include other off-balance-sheet arrangements in our Contractual Obligations table including operating lease payments and interest payments on our Notes, revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding.

Contractual Obligations

In addition to our Notes and revolving credit facility, we utilize operating leases as another source of financing. The amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our Contractual Obligations table.

(2) We lease certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment and vehicles. Our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions. These provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments that are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations.

(4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

The preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Effective in the third quarter of 2017, the Company realigned its three geographic divisions, which included the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names, into two U.S. geographic divisions. As a result of this realignment and change in the operating structure of its Carquest Independent and Carquest Canada businesses, the Company has increased its number of operating segments from four to five. As each operating segment represents a reporting unit, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach.

Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If a reporting unit’s fair value has historically significantly exceeded its carrying value, then a risk-based market approach of determining the reporting unit’s fair value is utilized. The Company uses a valuation specialist to determine the fair value for the remaining reporting units. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of the Carquest and Worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of GPI in 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level. Indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value, we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.

We complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our Company and our reporting units. These assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units. Critical assumptions include projected sales growth, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates, royalty rates and terminal growth rates. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.

Inventory Reserves

Our inventory consists primarily of parts, batteries, accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives. Although the risk of obsolescence is minimal, we consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for managing slower moving inventory. We establish reserves when the expected net proceeds are less than carrying value.

Future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory, changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations. A 10% difference in actual inventory reserves at December 30, 2017 would result in a change in expense of approximately $11.1 million for 2017.

Self-Insurance Reserves

Our self-insurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed, claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims, and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience. Specific factors include, but are not limited to, assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims. Generally, claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle. We classify the portion of our self-insurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in long-term liabilities.

While we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates, our self-insurance reserves and corresponding SG&A could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions. A 10% change in our self-insurance liabilities at December 30, 2017 would result in a change in expense of approximately $15.3 million for 2017.

Vendor Incentives

We receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations. Many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year, while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less. Volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in SG&A are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory. These deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

Vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to SG&A when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes.

Similarly, we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales. However, these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement. Short-term incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements.

Amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue. Management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in Other current liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in Receivables, net except for that portion expected to be received after one year, which is included in Other assets, net. We regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations. Historically, the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant. A 10% difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at December 30, 2017 would result in a change in deferred incentives of approximately $17.9 million for 2017.
