2017 Operations Summary

Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017, compared to
$2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. The 2017 results include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricanes Harvey
and Irma on our Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina facilities and an increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the
enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. The 2017 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted
share, and losses on retirement of debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. The 2016 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or
$0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and $162 million, or
$0.41 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. Our provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal
income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 372.221 million shares and
395.851 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.

Revenues increased to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. Revenues increased 5.1% and 3.8%,
respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2017, compared to 2016. The consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in
equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

During 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2016. Inpatient
surgical volumes increased 1.7% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.3% on a same facility basis during
2017, compared to 2016. Emergency room visits increased 2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016.

For 2017, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million, compared to 2016. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $710 million and $1.473 billion, respectively, for 2017, compared to 2016. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts,
uninsured discounts

and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017, compared to 33.0% for 2016. Same facility
uninsured admissions increased 5.9% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% for 2017, compared to 2016. Same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for
2016, compared to 2015.
Interest expense totaled $1.690 billion for 2017, compared to $1.707 billion for 2016.
The $17 million decline in interest expense for 2017 was due to the decline in the average interest rate.
Cash flows
from operating activities declined $227 million, from $5.653 billion for 2016 to $5.426 billion for 2017. The decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the net impact of the decline of net income of
$689 million, offset by positive changes related to depreciation and amortization of $165 million and income taxes of $310 million.

Business Strategy
We are
committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our
efforts around the following growth agenda:
Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets. We believe we are well
positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating
with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various
outpatient access points, including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and walk-in clinics.

Achieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical and Satisfaction Measures. Achieving high levels of patient safety,
patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information
technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these
initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.

Recruit and Employ Physicians to Meet the Needs for High Quality Health Services. We depend on the quality and
dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other
professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our
continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Business Strategy (continued)

Continue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to Enhance
Profitability. We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. We are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care
navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to
leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our Parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue
cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
Pursue a Disciplined
Development Strategy. We continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market
opportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. We believe the
challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. We have a strong record of
successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other
assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from
payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject
to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.
Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have
invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to
improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”)
requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the

55

Revenues (continued)

hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the
individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations, including but
not limited to EMTALA, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore,
these amounts are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured amounts related to patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. After the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a
significant portion of uninsured patients’ accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the
estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and
disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $41 million, $31 million and $48 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $56 million, $90 million and $85 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. We expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to Medicare and Medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients
is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. Our collection
policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary
internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months).
Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as
charity care.
The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical
writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly
changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion and 98% of the $5.116 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due
accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable
balance.
To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view
the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended December 31, follows
(dollars in millions):

------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- - ------ ---- - ------
 2017 2016 2015
Charity care $ 4,861 $ 4,151 $ 3,682
Uninsured discounts 14,520 13,047 10,692
Provision for doubtful accounts 4,039 3,257 3,913

Totals $ 23,420 $ 20,455 $ 18,287

Patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization) $ 37,557 $ 35,304 $ 33,760

Cost-to-charges ratio (patient care costs as percentage of gross patient charges) 12.9 % 13.5 % 14.5 %

Total uncompensated care $ 23,420 $ 20,455 $ 18,287
Multiply by the cost-to-charges ratio 12.9 % 13.5 % 14.5 %

Estimated cost of total uncompensated care $ 3,021 $ 2,761 $ 2,652

The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a
percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 34.9% for 2017, 33.0% for 2016 and 31.5% for 2015. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 52 days, 50 days and 53 days at
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage,
increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general

economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts

Professional Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities
are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability
risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks
were $466 million, $430 million and $344 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred
through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or
corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim
payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident
years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred
extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number

of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These
methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation
process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional
liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
Reserves and provisions for
professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.456 billion to $1.743 billion at December 31, 2017 and
$1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at December 31, 2016. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the
volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely
outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and
would increase the reserve estimate by $30 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $29 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $106 million or
reduce the reserve estimate by $98 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide
range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,500 and 2,700 individual claims at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period between the
occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an
occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.627 billion and $1.539 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $429 million and $391 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance
contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $24 million and
$45 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) were $1.603 billion and $1.494 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The estimated total net
reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are comprised of $751 million and $830 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $852 million and $664 million, respectively, of
reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

Net reserves for professional liability claims, December 31 $ 1,603 $ 1,494 $ 1,421

Income Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our
income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
Although we believe we have properly
reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain
tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax
positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results may vary from our
estimates.
Results of Operations

Revenue/Volume Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and
provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with
third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges.
We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.

Revenue/Volume Trends (continued)

Revenues increased 5.1% to $43.614 billion for 2017 from
$41.490 billion for 2016 and increased 4.6% for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. The increase in revenues in 2017 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in
equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2016 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the
prior year.
Same facility revenues increased 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016 and increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The 3.8% increase for 2017 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility
revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 4.1% increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase
in same facility equivalent admissions.
Consolidated admissions increased 2.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased
1.2% during 2016 compared to 2015. Consolidated surgeries increased 0.8% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 2.1% during 2016 compared to 2015. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 2.9% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 4.1%
during 2016 compared to 2015.
Same facility admissions increased 1.1% during 2017 compared to 2016 and during 2016
compared to 2015. Same facility surgeries declined 0.7% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 1.3% during 2016 compared to 2015. Same facility emergency room visits increased 1.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 3.8% during 2016
compared to 2015.
Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% and same facility uninsured admissions
increased 5.9% during 2017 compared to 2016. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015.

The approximate percentages of our admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care
and other insurers, and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are set forth below.

At December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the
state of Florida. Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $10.168 billion, $9.522 billion and $9.059 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we owned and
operated 46 hospitals and 27 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $10.634 billion, $9.898 billion and $9.517 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, 56% of our admissions and 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 70%, 69% and 68% of our
uninsured admissions during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We receive a significant portion of our revenues from
government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In December 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced that it
will phase out federal matching funds for Designated State Health Programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act due to concerns that the funds were not used as an integral part of Medicaid demonstrations focused on
delivery system reform or coverage reform.
Texas currently operates its Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement
Program pursuant to a Medicaid waiver (the “Texas Waiver Program”). In December 2017, CMS approved an extension of this waiver through September 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. As currently
structured, the Texas Waiver Program includes two primary components: an uncompensated care component and a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (“DSRIP”) component. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide incentive
payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. CMS will provide level DSRIP
funding for two years, decreased funding for the following two years, and no DSRIP funding beginning October 1, 2021. In addition, the disbursement methodology for uncompensated care pool funding will be revised to align with federal policies.
Beginning October 1, 2019, Texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until CMS approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for the state that will govern how hospitals’
uncompensated care entitlement is calculated and the size of the statewide uncompensated care pool. Based on the waiver renewal terms, we expect the statewide uncompensated care pool size will ultimately be reduced, but

it is presently unclear whether our share of the pool and its corresponding uncompensated care payments will increase or decrease. We provide charity care services directly to patients in several
communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. As a result of additional charitable care being provided directly to patients by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in Texas have available funds that were
previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these
available funds to the state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal Medicaid funds, as they
have been for the past twelve years in Texas. The state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional
indigent care services.
Our Texas Medicaid revenues included $351 million ($108 million DSRIP related and
$243 million uncompensated care related), $370 million ($101 million DSRIP related and $269 million uncompensated care related) and $347 million ($95 million DSRIP related and $252 million uncompensated care
related) during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of Medicaid supplemental waiver payments. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended or revised beyond September 30, 2022.

In addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs are
currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such
supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any,
may have on our results of operations.

(b) Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016

Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017, compared to
$2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. Financial results for 2017 include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the impact of
hurricanes Harvey and Irma on our Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina facilities and an increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. Financial results for 2017 also include tax benefits of $82 million, or
$0.22 per diluted share, related to employee equity award settlements, net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Financial
results for 2016 include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to employee
equity award settlements. Financial results for 2016 also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits
of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the settlement of the Health Midwest litigation. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings
per share were 372.221 million shares and 395.851 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of
our common stock.
During 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%
compared to 2016. Consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 1.7% and same facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.3% during 2017 compared to 2016. Consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 0.3%, and same facility outpatient surgeries declined
1.3% during 2017 compared to 2016. Emergency room visits increased 2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017 compared to 2016.

Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 6.5% to $47.653 billion for 2017 from $44.747 billion for
2016. The provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million from $3.257 billion in 2016 to $4.039 billion in 2017. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts
due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased
$710 million and $1.473 billion, respectively, during 2017 compared to 2016. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts,
uninsured discounts and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017 compared to 33.0% for 2016. At December 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including
accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased 5.1% to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. The increase in revenues was due
to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2016. Same facility revenues increased 3.8% due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same
facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2016.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.0% in 2017 and 45.5% in 2016. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
admission increased 3.1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Same facility labor rate increases

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.4% in 2017 and 18.1% in 2016. Other operating expenses are
primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for losses related to professional liability
risks were $466 million and $430 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was
$45 million for 2017 and $54 million for 2016.
Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was
4.9% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2016. Depreciation expense was $2.111 billion for 2017 and $1.946 billion for 2016.

Interest expense declined to $1.690 billion for 2017 from $1.707 billion for 2016. The decline in interest expense
was due to a decline in the average interest rate. Our average debt balance was $32.082 billion for 2017 compared to $31.048 billion for 2016. The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.5% for 2016 to 5.3% for 2017.

Net gains on sales of facilities were $8 million and $23 million, respectively, for 2017 and 2016 and related
to sales of real estate and other investments.
During 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of
5.500% senior secured notes due 2047. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain hospital acquisitions, and the redemption of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of our existing
8.000% senior notes maturing in October 2018. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $39 million. During 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds for
general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion
senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.

The effective tax rates were 42.5% and 32.3% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included increases of $301 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due
to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $14 million related to reductions in interest expense (net of tax). Our provision for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 also included tax benefits of $82 million and $162 million,
respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. Our provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years.
Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 would have been 37.2% and 37.3%, respectively.

36.325 million and 31.991 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
During 2016, consolidated
admissions increased 1.2% and same facility admissions increased 1.1% compared to 2015. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries each increased 1.4% during 2016 compared to 2015. Consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 2.5%, and same
facility outpatient surgeries increased 1.2% during 2016 compared to 2015. Emergency room visits increased 4.1% on a consolidated basis and increased 3.8% on a same facility basis during 2016 compared to 2015.

Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 2.7% to $44.747 billion for 2016 from $43.591 billion for
2015. The provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million from $3.913 billion in 2015 to $3.257 billion in 2016. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts
due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased
$469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, during 2016 compared to 2015. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts,
uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016 compared to 31.5% for 2015. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion total patient due accounts receivable
balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased 4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. The increase in revenues was due
primarily to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2015. Same facility revenues increased 4.1% due to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same
facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2015.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.7% in both 2016 and 2015.
Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in 2016 compared to 2015. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.6% for medical devices and 3.4% for pharmacy supplies and declined 0.1% for general medical and surgical items in 2016
compared to 2015.
Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.1% in 2016 and 17.8% in 2015. Other
operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for losses related to
professional liability risks were $430 million and $344 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in provision for losses related to professional liability risks for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $64 million
of favorable development related to prior years’ claims recorded in 2015.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was
$54 million for 2016 and $46 million for 2015.
Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was
4.8% in both 2016 and 2015. Depreciation expense was $1.946 billion for 2016 and $1.880 billion for 2015.

Interest expense increased to $1.707 billion for 2016 from $1.665 billion for 2015. The increase in interest expense
was due to an increase in the average debt balance. Our average debt balance was $31.048 billion for 2016 compared to $29.718 billion for 2015. The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6% for 2015 to 5.5% for 2016.

Net gains on sales of facilities were $23 million for 2016 and related to sales of real estate and other
investments. Net losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2015 and related to sales of real estate and other investments.

During 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net
proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new
$1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million. During 2015, we redeemed all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of
7 3⁄4 % senior notes due 2021 and all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.500% senior notes due 2016. We also entered into
a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans. The pretax losses on retirement of debt related to these redemptions were $135 million.

We reached a settlement agreement with the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City related to a previously disclosed
contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The settlement agreement enabled us to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million
and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million related to this litigation for 2016. We recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related to this matter. We also recorded $120 million of legal
claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action lawsuit and related derivative actions.
The effective tax
rates were 32.3% and 37.2% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.

Our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and
$162 million related to excess tax benefits from employee equity award settlements. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2016 would have been 37.3%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $567 million for 2015 to $542 million for 2016.
The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our United Kingdom market, a Texas market and an Oklahoma market.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing
properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities,
issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
Cash provided by
operating activities totaled $5.426 billion in 2017 compared to $5.653 billion in 2016 and $4.734 billion in 2015. Working capital totaled $3.819 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.252 billion at December 31,
2016. The $227 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily related to the $689 million decline in net income, offset by increases related to depreciation and amortization of
$165 million and income taxes of $310 million. The $919 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income. Cash payments for
interest and income taxes declined $16 million for 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015.

Cash used in investing activities was $4.279 billion, $3.240 billion and $2.583 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $3.015 billion in 2017, $2.760 billion in 2016 and $2.375 billion in 2015. We expended $1.212 billion, $576 million and $351 million for acquisitions of
hospitals and health care entities during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $3.5 billion in 2018. At December 31, 2017, there were projects under construction which had an estimated
additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $3.1 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.061 billion in 2017, $2.508 billion in 2016 and $1.976 billion in
2015. During 2017, we had a net increase of $1.509 billion in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.051 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2016, we had a net increase of $815 million in our indebtedness and used cash of
$2.751 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2015, we had a net increase of $778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.397 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we made distributions
to noncontrolling interests of $448 million, $434 million and $495 million, respectively. We paid debt issuance costs of $26 million, $40 million and $50 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We, or our
affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other
legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. At December 31, 2017, $1.802 billion of
share repurchase authorization remained available under the $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors during October 2017. Funds for the

repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds. On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors
initiated and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors,
including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate
laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured
credit facilities ($2.047 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $1.827 billion as of January 31, 2018) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.

Investments of our insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $472 million and
$385 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $194 million and $215 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our
facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured
professional liability risks retained were $1.409 billion and $1.279 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate
$424 million. We estimate that approximately $378 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $33.058 billion and
$31.376 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our interest expense was $1.690 billion for 2017 and $1.707 billion for 2016.

During March 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. We used
the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new
$1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March 2023.
During August 2016, we issued
$1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement
to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.

During June 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior secured notes due 2047. We used
the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain hospital acquisitions, and the redemption, during July 2017, of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 8.000% senior notes maturing
in October 2018. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $39 million.

During
June 2017, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facilities by (i) increasing the commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to $3.750 billion, (ii) extending the maturity date of the revolving
credit commitments to June 28, 2022, (iii) amending the incremental facility provisions to permit the incurrence of additional incremental credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and (iv) providing that
the commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility shall be 0.250% per annum.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

(a) We have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $439 million at December 31, 2017, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b) Estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at December 31, 2017, remain constant during the period presented.

(c) The estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.

(d) Amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

(e) Amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover utility and construction deposits and Medicaid provider bonds.

(f) In consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians’ practices. The actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians’ private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. The physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at December 31, 2017.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in our 100% owned insurance
subsidiaries were $472 million at December 31, 2017. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2017, we had a
net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.
We are exposed to
market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require
significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might
otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market
valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
We are also exposed
to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.
Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized
in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $5.072 billion of long-term debt at December 31,
2017 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.986 billion at December 31, 2017 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior
secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR
rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our
long-term debt declined from 5.5% for 2016 to 5.3% for 2017.
The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was
$34.689 billion at December 31, 2017. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the
potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $51 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

We are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk
related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading
or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and
losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare patients are established under the federal government’s prospective payment system. Total
fee-for-service Medicare revenues were 21.7%, 21.4% and 21.8% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because
of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain
operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.
Tax Examinations

During 2016, the IRS completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax
years. We are subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2014 and later as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities.

Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However,
if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
