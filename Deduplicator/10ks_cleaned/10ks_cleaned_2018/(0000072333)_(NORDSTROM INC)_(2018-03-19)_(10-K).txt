Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Retail Business is not a reportable segment.
We continually monitor and review our segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact our reportable segments. As a result of the evolution of our operations, our reportable segments have become progressively more integrated such that we will change our reportable segments to one reportable segment to align with how management will view the results of our operations in the first quarter of 2018.
Accounting Policy
In general, we use the same measurements to compute earnings before income taxes for reportable segments as we do for the consolidated Company. However, redemptions of our Nordstrom Notes are included in net sales for our Retail segment. The sales amount in our Corporate/Other column includes an entry to eliminate these transactions from our consolidated net sales. The related Nordstrom Notes expenses are included in our Retail segment at face value. Our Corporate/Other column includes an adjustment to reduce the Nordstrom Notes expense from face value to their estimated cost. In addition, our sales return reserve and other corporate adjustments are recorded in the Corporate/Other column. Other than as described above, the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The following table sets forth information for our reportable segments:

------------------------------------------------ ------ ------- --------------- - ----- --------------- - ------- - ----- -- -------

Accounting Policy
In general, we use the same measurements to compute earnings before income taxes for reportable segments as described above, the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Self-Insurance
We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to employee health and welfare, workers compensation and other liability claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include undiscounted estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost using an actuarially-based analysis of claims experience, regulatory changes and other relevant factors.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs, marketing, supply chain, technology and, prior to our credit card receivable transactions in October 2015 and November 2017, bad debt expense related to our credit card operations.

Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock-based awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2010 Plan ), 2002 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan ( 2002 Plan ) and Trunk Club Value Creation Plan ( VCP ), and employees may purchase our stock at a discount under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ). We predominantly recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based awards at their estimated grant date fair value, recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for certain award holders is accelerated based upon age and years of service. The total compensation expense is reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur over the vesting period of the awards.
We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Lattice option valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense related to the VCP is based on the grant date fair value of the payout scenario we believe is probable using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is recognized on an accelerated basis due to performance criteria and graded vesting features of the plan. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the estimated present value of dividends over the vesting period. Performance share units granted prior to 2016 are classified as liabilities and revalued using the quoted price of our common stock as of each reporting date. Performance share units granted in 2016 and beyond are classified as equity and the fair value is determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model.

Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs include payments to third-party shippers and costs to hold, move and prepare merchandise for shipment. These costs do not include in-bound freight to our distribution centers, which we include in the cost of our inventory. Shipping and handling costs of $523, $453 and $428 in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

NOTE 11: SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY
The following is a summary of the activity related to our share repurchase programs in 2015, 2016 and 2017:

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ ---------------------- ----- ------ ------ ------ -

 Shares Average priceper share Amount
Capacity at January 31, 2015 $1,075
October 2015 authorization (ended March 1, 2017) 1,000
Shares repurchased 19.1 $63 (1,191 )
Expiration of unused capacity in March 20151 (73 )
Capacity at January 30, 2016 811
Shares repurchased 5.9 $48 (282 )
Capacity at January 28, 2017 529
February 2017 authorization (ending August 31, 2018) 500
Shares repurchased 4.6 $45 (206 )
Expiration of unused October 2015 authorization capacity in March 2017 (409 )
Capacity at February 3, 2018 $414

1 Expiration relates to the February 2013 program.
The actual timing, price, manner and amounts of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable SEC rules.
We paid dividends of $1.48 per share in 2017 and 2016 and $6.33 per share in 2015. Dividends paid in 2015 included a special cash dividend of $905, or $4.85 per share of outstanding common stock, in addition to our quarterly dividends totaling $1.48 per share. The special dividend was authorized by our Board of Directors on October 1, 2015, and was paid using proceeds from the sale of our credit card receivables (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction).
In February 2018, subsequent to year end, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which will be paid on March 20, 2018.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - --- ---- - ---

Fiscal year 2017 2016 2015
Unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $32 $19 $15
Gross increase to tax positions in prior periods 2 16 6
Gross decrease to tax positions in prior periods (7 ) — (2 )
Gross increase to tax positions in current period 5 2 2
Lapses in statute (1 ) (5 ) (2 )
Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $31 $32 $19

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. Uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Our most significant accounting judgments and estimates include revenue recognition, inventory, long-lived assets, goodwill, stock-based compensation and income taxes.

One week of the Anniversary Sale, historically our largest event of the year, shifted into the third quarter. Combined second and third quarter comparable sales, which removes the impact of the event shift, increased 0.4% compared with the same period last year.

Other retail includes Nordstrom Canada full-line stores, Trunk Club and Jeffrey boutiques.

Quarterly totals may not foot across due to rounding.

Loss per basic and diluted share included the impact of the Trunk Club goodwill impairment charge of $1.14 and $1.12 per share in the third quarter of 2016.

The 53rd week is not included in comparable sales calculations (see Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information about the 53rd week).

Deductions consist of actual returns, net of the value of the merchandise returned and any sales commission.

The statutory rate in 2017 is reduced due to tax reform.

Other unsecured debt includes our Puerto Rico unsecured borrowing facility partially offset by deferred bond issue costs.

Expiration relates to the February 2013 program.

Other includes Nordstrom.com and Jeffrey goodwill.

Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss in the third quarter of 2016, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the weighted-average shares outstanding has been omitted from the quarterly calculation of loss per diluted share. The impact of these potentially dilutive securities has been included in the calculation of weighted-average shares for all other periods in 2016.

Nordstrom full-line stores - U.S. includes Nordstrom Local.
