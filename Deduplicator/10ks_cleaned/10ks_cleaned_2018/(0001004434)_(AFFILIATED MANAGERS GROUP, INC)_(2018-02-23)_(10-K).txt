Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-Looking Statements” section set forth in Part I and the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any more recent filings with the SEC, each of which describes these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.

Executive Overview
The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition. This overview and the remainder of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our “Affiliates.” Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate’s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of December 31, 2017, our assets under management were $836.3 billion in more than 550 investment products across a broad range of active return-oriented strategies.
We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates and maintain the same partnership approach, provide support and assistance in substantially the same manner, and our operating model is generally the same for all Affiliates. Furthermore, our Affiliates are all impacted by similar marketplace factors and operational trends. Therefore, our aggregate operating measures of assets under management, average assets under management and aggregate fees, which incorporate the assets under management and fees of all of our Affiliates, are important in providing management with a more comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business.
 The following table presents our key operating performance measures:

(1) Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate's financial and operating results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Aggregate fees consists of the total asset and performance based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Aggregate fees is an operating measure and is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we renamed our operating measure formerly referred to as aggregate revenue to aggregate fees. There was no change in the calculation of this measure.

Assets under Management

Through our Affiliates, we manage active return-oriented strategies, rather than passively-managed products, which typically carry lower fee rates. We continue to see client demand for active return-oriented strategies, particularly in alternative and multi-asset strategies, reflecting continued investor demand for returns that are less correlated to traditional equity and fixed income markets. In addition, we see both U.S. and non-U.S. investors increasing their allocations to global equities strategies. Investor demand for passively-managed products has continued, particularly for the large cap U.S. equity portions of client portfolios, and we have experienced outflows in U.S. equity strategies consistent with this industry-wide trend. We

expect client demand for alternative, global equities and multi-asset strategies to continue, and believe the best-performing active equity managers (whether global-, regional- or country-specific) will continue to have significant opportunities to grow from net client cash inflows. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

The following charts provide information regarding the composition of our assets under management by active return-oriented strategy as of December 31, 2016 and 2017:

(1) Alternatives primarily include assets under management in fixed income, equity relative value, systematic diversified, private equity and real assets, and other alternative strategies. Alternative strategies generate earnings from (i) asset based fees from products subject to lock-ups or similar restrictions, (ii) asset based fees from products not subject to such restrictions and/or (iii) performance fees and carried interest.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Global equities include emerging markets strategies, which accounted for 9% of our aggregate assets under management as of December 31, 2016 and 2017.

(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating into U.S. dollars the assets under management of Affiliates whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

In addition to assets under management, we also report average assets under management. This measure provides a more meaningful relationship to aggregate fees as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial and operating results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management were $779.2 billion in 2017, an increase of $123.6 billion or 19% compared to 2016.

Aggregate Fees

Aggregate fees consists of the total asset and performance based fees earned by all of our Affiliates. Asset based fees include advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined as a percentage of the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are based on investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, and are recognized when they are earned (i.e., when they become billable to customers and are not subject to claw-back). Our ratio of asset based fees to average assets under management (“asset based fee ratio”) is calculated as asset based fees divided by average assets under management. Our asset based fee ratios may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange or changes in contractual fees.

Our aggregate fees are generally determined by the level of our average assets under management, the composition of these assets across our active return-oriented strategies that realize different asset based fee ratios, and performance fees. Aggregate fees were $5,545.8 million in 2017, an increase of $1,249.5 million or 29% compared to 2016. The increase in our

21

Table of Contents

aggregate fees was the result of an increase in asset based fees of $778.4 million or 18% due to a 19% increase in our average assets under management and an increase in performance fees of $471.1 million or 11%.

In 2017, we experienced increases in average assets under management across all of our active return-oriented strategies, and, in particular, our alternative strategies, where average assets under management increased 31%. Assets under management in our alternative strategies increased due to investments in new Affiliates, net client cash inflows, market changes and foreign exchange. Our alternative strategies generally have higher asset based fee ratios than our other strategies, which resulted in an increase in our total asset based fee ratio.

Financial and Supplemental Financial Performance Measures
The following table presents our key financial and supplemental financial performance measures:

--------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ----- ---- ------- -------- ----- -- - -- -

 For the Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2016 2017 % Change
Net income (controlling interest) $ 472.8 $ 689.5 46 %
Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)(1) 945.5 1,116.2 18 %
Economic net income (controlling interest)(1) 703.6 824.4 17 %

__________________________

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) and Economic net income (controlling interest) are non-GAAP performance measures and are discussed in “Supplemental Financial Performance Measures.”

Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. Conversely, our most directly comparable GAAP performance measures, Operating income and Income before income taxes, include the non-controlling interest’s share of financial performance.
Our economic interest in Affiliates in which we own a controlling interest is generally greater than in Affiliates in which we do not own a controlling interest. While our aggregate fees increased 29% in 2017, our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $170.7 million or 18%, as we experienced a greater proportion of growth in aggregate fees at Affiliates in which we do not own a controlling interest and, therefore, own less of an economic interest, including our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.
While Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased $170.7 million or 18% in 2017, our Net income (controlling interest) increased $216.7 million or 46%, primarily due to a provisional one-time net benefit from changes in U.S. tax laws of $194.1 million, partially offset by a $93.1 million expense ($57.4 million net of tax), associated with the impairment of one of our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method.
We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) to be an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance after tax and before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates.  Our Economic net income (controlling interest), which excludes impairments and the impact of changes in U.S. tax laws, among other things, increased $120.8 million or 17% in 2017, consistent with the increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest).

Results of Operations
The following discussion includes the financial results of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates’ financial results are included in our Revenue, Operating expenses and Non-operating (income) and expenses, and our share of our equity method Affiliates’ financial results is reported (net of intangible amortization and impairments) in Income from equity method investments in Operating income.
Revenue
We derive most of our Revenue from asset and performance based fees from investment management services provided by our consolidated Affiliates. Asset based fees include advisory and other fees, which are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are based on investment performance,

22

Table of Contents

typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, and are recognized when they are earned (i.e., when they become billable to customers and are not subject to claw-back). Performance fees are generally billed less frequently than asset based fees and, although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our Revenue.
Our Revenue is generally determined by the level of our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management, the composition of these assets across our Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize different asset based fee ratios and performance fees. Consolidated Affiliate average assets under management reflects the particular billing patterns of products and client accounts and, therefore, provides a more meaningful relationship to the asset based fee portion of our Revenue. Our ratio of consolidated Affiliate asset based fees to consolidated Affiliate average assets under management (“consolidated Affiliate asset based fee ratio”) may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange rate changes or changes in contractual fees.
The following table summarizes our consolidated Affiliate average assets under management and Revenue:

-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ------- ---- -------- ------- ---- -------- -- - ------- - -

 For the Years Ended December 31,
(in millions, except as noted) 2015 2016 % Change 2017 % Change
Consolidated Affiliate average assets under management (in billions) $ 396.4 $ 373.4 (6 )% $ 406.5 9 %
Revenue $ 2,484.5 $ 2,194.6 (12 )% $ 2,305.0 5 %

Our Revenue increased $110.4 million or 5% in 2017, due to a $129.1 million or 6% increase from asset based fees, partially offset by a $18.7 million or 1% decrease from performance fees. The increase in asset based fees was due to a 9% increase in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management where we experienced increases in assets under management, primarily from market changes and foreign exchange, partially offset by net client cash outflows. The increase in asset based fees was partially offset by a 3% decline in our consolidated Affiliate asset based fee ratio. The decline in our consolidated Affiliate asset based fee ratio was due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management between Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively higher asset based fee ratios and Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively lower asset based fee ratios.
Our Revenue decreased $289.9 million or 12% in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in consolidated Affiliate average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset based fees $186.2 million or 7%. This decrease was also the result of a decline in our consolidated Affiliate asset based fee ratio at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset based fees $126.0 million or 5%, including a reduction in asset based fees related to renewal commissions at one of our Affiliates in the UK. The reduction in asset based fees related to renewal commissions was the result of a regulatory change and was offset by a decline in distribution expenses at the Affiliate that reduced our Selling, general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Revenue from the full-year impact of our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $16.8 million or 1%, as well as an increase in performance fees at existing Affiliates of $5.5 million. The decline in our consolidated asset based fee ratios and Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively lower asset based fee ratios, as well as the aforementioned decline in renewal commissions.

Operating Expenses
The following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses:

--------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ------- ---- ----- -------- ------- ---- -- -------- ----- - ------- -- - -

 For the Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2015 2016 % Change 2017 % Change
Compensation and related expenses $ 1,027.7 $ 932.4 (9 )% $ 979.0 5 %
Selling, general and administrative 443.8 398.1 (10 )% 373.1 (6 )%
Intangible amortization and impairments 115.4 110.2 (5 )% 86.4 (22 )%
Depreciation and other amortization 18.8 19.5 4 % 20.3 4 %
Other operating expenses (net) 43.8 29.1 (34 )% 40.5 39 %
Total operating expenses $ 1,649.5 $ 1,489.3 (10 )% $ 1,499.3 1 %

23

Table of Contents

Our operating expenses are primarily attributable to the non-controlling interests of our consolidated Affiliates in which we share in revenue without regard to expenses. For these Affiliates, the amount of their operating expenses attributable to the non-controlling interests, including compensation, is generally determined by the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses as part of the structured partnership interests in place at the respective Affiliate. Accordingly, increases in revenue generally will increase a consolidated Affiliates’ expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest and decreases in revenue will generally decrease a consolidated Affiliates’ expenses attributable to the non-controlling interest.
Compensation and related expenses increased $46.6 million or 5% in 2017, primarily due to increases in compensation expenses at Affiliates of $35.0 million or 4% and compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions of $8.5 million or 1%. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.
Compensation and related expenses decreased $95.3 million or 9% in 2016, primarily due to decreases in compensation expenses at existing Affiliates of $78.3 million or 8% and compensation expenses associated with Affiliate equity transactions of $28.7 million or 3%. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses from the full-year impact in 2016 of our 2015 investments in new Affiliates of $7.0 million or 1%. These changes primarily relate to the non-controlling interests.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $25.0 million or 6% in 2017, primarily due to a 2016 expense recorded by and attributable to Third Avenue Management, LLC in connection with claims relating to the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund of $15.0 million or 4%, which did not recur in 2017, as well as a $5.8 million or 1% reduction of expenses related to wealth management initiatives and a $5.7 million or 1% reduction in distribution expenses, related to commissions at certain of our Affiliates in the UK.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $45.7 million or 10% in 2016, primarily due to decreases in sub-advisory and distribution expenses, including renewal commissions, of $57.7 million or 13% at our Affiliates sponsoring retail products. This decrease was partially offset by a reserve of $15.0 million or 3% recorded by and attributable to Third Avenue Management, LLC in connection with a proposed resolution of claims relating to the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund.
Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $23.8 million or 22% in 2017, due to a $16.0 million or 15% decrease from a change in the pattern of economic benefit for certain assets and a $7.8 million or 7% decrease from certain assets being fully amortized.
Intangible amortization and impairments decreased $5.2 million or 5% in 2016, primarily due to certain assets being fully amortized in 2015, which decreased intangible amortization $13.2 million or 11%, partially offset by increases in intangible amortization of definite-lived assets at existing Affiliates of $5.5 million or 5%.
There were no significant changes in Depreciation and other amortization in 2017 or 2016.
Other operating expenses (net) increased $11.4 million or 39% in 2017 and decreased $14.7 million or 34% in 2016. In 2017, this increase was primarily due to a decrease in net gains on Affiliates’ consolidated investment products of $8.1 million. In 2016, this decrease was primarily due to net gains on Affiliates’ consolidated investment products of $12.5 million.
Income from Equity Method Investments
When we do not own a controlling interest in an Affiliate, but have significant influence, we account for our interest in the Affiliate under the equity method. For these Affiliates, we use structured partnership interests in which our share of the Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated, allocated and distributed using a formula whereby our share is based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. This type of partnership interest allows us to benefit from any increase in revenue or any decrease in the expenses that are included in the calculation, but also directly exposes us to any decrease in revenue or any increase in such expenses. We also use structured partnership interests in which our share of the Affiliate’s earnings or losses is contractually calculated, allocated and distributed using a formula whereby our share is based on a percentage of the Affiliate’s revenue without regard to expenses. In this type of partnership interest, our contractual share of revenue generally has priority over distributions to Affiliate management. Our share of earnings from these Affiliates, net of amortization and impairments, is included in Income from equity method investments in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Our equity method Affiliates derive most of their revenue from asset and performance based fees from investment management services. Asset based fees include advisory and other fees, which are typically determined as a percentage fee charged on the value of a client’s assets under management. Performance fees are based on investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark, and are recognized when they are earned (i.e., when they become billable to customers and are not subject to claw-back). Performance fees are generally billed less frequently than asset based fees and,

Table of Contents

although performance fees inherently depend on investment performance and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees will be a recurring component of our Income from equity method investments.
Equity method revenue incorporates the total asset and performance based fees earned by all our equity method Affiliates. Equity method revenue is an operating measure and is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Income from equity method investments or other financial performance measures. Our equity method revenue is generally determined by the level of our equity method Affiliate average assets under management, the composition of these assets across our Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize different asset based fee ratios and performance fees. Equity method Affiliate average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to the asset based fee portion of our equity method revenue, as it reflects the particular billing patterns of products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial and operating results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our ratio of equity method Affiliate asset based fees to equity method Affiliate average assets under management (“equity method Affiliate asset based fee ratio”) may change as a result of new investments, client cash flows, market changes, foreign exchange rate changes or changes in contractual fees.
Additional investments in new or existing equity method Affiliates will generally impact our financial results in the year of investment and, depending upon the timing, in the following year when the full-year financial results of the investment are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table summarizes equity method Affiliate average assets under management and equity method revenue, as well as equity method earnings and equity method intangible amortization and impairments, which in aggregate form Income from equity method investments.

(1) Equity method revenue is not derived from and differs from the revenue of our equity method Affiliates reported in Note

13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as it does not include the financial impact of any sponsored investment products or entities that may need to be consolidated by our equity method Affiliates under GAAP and it excludes asset and performance based fees of new equity method Affiliates prior to the date of closing of the respective investment.

Our equity method revenue increased $1,139.1 million or 54% in 2017, due to a $649.1 million or 31% increase from asset based revenue and a $490.0 million or 23% increase from performance fees. The increase in asset based revenue was due to a 32% increase in equity method Affiliate average assets under management where we experienced increases in assets under management from investments in new Affiliates, net client cash flows, market changes and foreign exchange. The increase in asset based revenue was also due to a 3% increase in our equity method Affiliate asset based fee ratio due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management between Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively higher asset based fee ratios and Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively lower asset based fee ratios. Performance fees increased due to the full-year impact in 2017 of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates and due to increases in performance fees at existing Affiliates.
While equity method revenue increased 54% in 2017, equity method earnings increased $113.4 million or 29%, primarily due to our 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the economic interests.
Equity method intangible amortization and impairments increased $140.0 million in 2017, primarily as a result of a $93.1 million impairment of one of our Affiliates (see “Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments”) and a $41.0 million increase from the full-year impact in 2017 of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.

Table of Contents

Our equity method revenue increased $446.1 million or 27% in 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from the full-year impact of our 2015 investments and the partial-year impact of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates of $352.5 million or 21%. The increase was also the result of an increase in equity method Affiliate average assets under management at existing Affiliates, which increased asset based fees $133.3 million or 8%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our equity method Affiliate asset based fee ratio at existing Affiliates, which reduced asset based fees $21.7 million or 1%, as well as a decrease in performance fees at existing Affiliates of $18.0 million or 1%. The decline in our equity method Affiliate asset based fee ratio was due to a change in the composition of our average assets under management between Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively higher asset based fee ratios and Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts that realize comparatively lower asset based fee ratios.
While equity method revenue increased 27% in 2016, equity method earnings increased $64.8 million or 20% in 2016, primarily due to our 2015 and 2016 investments in new Affiliates, in which we own less of the economic interests, and an increase in expenses at Affiliates where our structured partnership interest is calculated by reference to the Affiliate’s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses.
Equity method intangible amortization and impairments increased $24.9 million or 73% in 2016, primarily as a result of a $21.5 million increase from the full-year impact in 2016 of our 2015 investments in new Affiliates and the partial-year impact of our 2016 investments in new Affiliates.

--- ------------------------------------
(1) Percentage change is not meaningful.

Investment and other income increased $26.2 million or 78% in 2017, due to a $19.5 million increase in the fair value of Affiliates’ investments and a $6.7 million increase in net realized gains.
Investment and other income increased $18.5 million or 121% in 2016, primarily due to a $11.9 million increase in net realized gains and a $7.0 million increase in the fair value of Affiliates’ investments.
Interest expense decreased $4.1 million or 5% in 2017, primarily due to the redemption of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2042 in August 2017, which decreased Interest expense $5.3 million. There was no significant change in our Interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015.
Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $11.6 million in 2017, primarily due to a $6.6 million expense on the revaluation of our contingent payment arrangements as compared to a $2.8 million gain recorded in 2016.
Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements decreased $44.2 million in 2016, primarily due to a $44.7 million gain on the revaluation of our contingent payment arrangements in 2015 as compared to a $2.8 million gain recorded in 2016.
Income tax expense decreased $177.2 million or 75% in 2017, primarily due to a provisional one-time net benefit of $194.1 million from changes in U.S. tax laws, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense due to an increase in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest. The net benefit from changes in U.S tax laws was primarily due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets and convertible securities.
Income tax expense decreased $27.8 million or 11% in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in Income before income taxes attributable to the controlling interest, as well as the effect of foreign operations.

Supplemental Financial Performance Measures
Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest)
As supplemental information, we provide a non-GAAP measure to which we refer as Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management as it provides a comprehensive view of our share of the financial performance of our business before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures.

Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per Share
As supplemental information, we also provide non-GAAP performance measures to which we refer as Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share to be important measures of our financial performance, as we believe they best represent performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates, and they are, therefore, employed as our principal performance measures. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as substitutes for, Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures.
Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets and other economic items, which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we have also excluded from Economic net income (controlling interest) a provisional one-time net benefit from changes in U.S. tax laws. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements to better reflect our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. We have excluded the one-time impact of the changes in U.S. tax laws to ensure comparability with prior and future periods.
Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these convertible securities in excess of par, if any, is deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
In 2017, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash during the year were, and for the foreseeable future are expected to be, for repayments of senior debt, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, repurchases of common stock, Affiliate equity repurchases, the payment of cash dividends on our common stock and general working capital purposes. We also expect that a principal use of cash will be investments in new and existing Affiliates. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with borrowings under our revolver and proceeds from our equity distribution program, will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.
Cash and cash equivalents were $439.5 million and $430.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table summarizes our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities:

------------------- -------------------------------- ------- ---- -------- ---- ------- -------- - - -------

 For the Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2015 2016 2017
Operating cash flow $ 1,213.2 $ 1,050.3 $ 1,170.4
Investing cash flow (324.5 ) (1,332.2 ) 13.8
Financing cash flow (857.7 ) 200.9 (1,189.7 )

Operating Cash Flow
In 2017, operating cash flows were $1.2 billion, of which approximately 70% was attributable to the controlling interest. Operating cash flows increased $120.1 million, of which approximately 90% of the total change was attributable to the controlling interest, primarily from cash distributions of our share of equity method earnings.
In 2016, operating cash flows were $1.1 billion, of which approximately 70% was attributable to the controlling interest. Operating cash flows decreased $162.9 million, of which approximately 50% of the total change was attributable to the controlling interest, primarily due to a timing difference between cash distributions received by the controlling interest of our share of equity method earnings and the recording of such earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2016, the net effect of these timing differences decreased cash flows to the controlling interest $64.5 million.
Investing Cash Flow
Investing cash flows increased $1.3 billion in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in cash used to make investments in Affiliates, which was attributable to the controlling interest.
Investing cash flows decreased $1.0 billion in 2016, primarily due to a $1.1 billion increase in cash used to make investments in Affiliates, which was attributable to the controlling interest.
Financing Cash Flow
Financing cash flows decreased $1.4 billion in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $485.0 million change in senior debt activity (from net borrowings of $225.0 million in 2016 to net repayments of $260.0 million in 2017), a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $423.9 million and an increase in the repurchase of our common stock of $359.8 million, all of which were attributable to the controlling interest.

29

Table of Contents

Financing cash flows increased $1.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily a result of a $408.0 million increase in the issuance of our common stock, a $380.3 million decrease in repurchases of our common stock and a $227.7 million increase in net borrowings of senior debt, all of which were attributable to the controlling interest.  We used available cash, proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and borrowings under our credit facilities to finance our investments in new Affiliates in 2016.

Senior Debt and Convertible Securities
The following table summarizes the carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness:

---------------------- ------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - -----

 December 31,
(in millions) 2015 2016 2017
Senior bank debt $ 645.0 $ 870.0 $ 810.0
Senior notes 944.6 945.1 745.7
Convertible securities 305.2 307.5 309.9

Senior Bank Debt
We have a senior unsecured multicurrency revolving $1.45 billion credit facility (the “revolver”) and a senior unsecured $385.0 million term loan facility (the “term loan” and, together with the revolver, the “credit facilities”). The credit facilities mature on September 30, 2020.
Subject to certain conditions, we may further increase the commitments under the revolver by up to $350.0 million and borrow up to an additional $65.0 million under the term loan. We pay interest on any outstanding obligations under the revolver and on the term loan at specified rates, based either on the LIBOR rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time.
Under the terms of our credit facilities we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants. The first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA (the “bank leverage ratio”) of 3.25x. The second covenant is a minimum EBITDA to cash interest expense ratio of 3.00x (the “bank interest coverage ratio”). For purposes of calculating these ratios, share-based compensation and Affiliate equity expense are added back to EBITDA. As of December 31, 2017, our bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were 1.3x and 14.5x, respectively, and we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1 billion of remaining capacity under our revolver, and could borrow all such capacity and remain in compliance with our credit facilities.
Our ability to draw funding from the debt and capital markets globally is a significant source of liquidity for us, and our credit ratings, among other factors, allow us to access these sources of funding on favorable terms. We are currently rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by S&P Global Ratings.

Senior Notes
In 2017, we redeemed, canceled and retired all $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2042 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount. At December 31, 2017, we had two senior notes outstanding, and their respective principal terms are summarized below.

Convertible Securities
At December 31, 2017, we had junior convertible trust preferred securities outstanding (the “junior convertible securities”) with a carrying value of $309.9 million. The carrying value is accreted to the principal amount at maturity ($430.8 million) over a remaining life of approximately 20 years. The junior convertible securities bear interest at 5.15% per annum, payable quarterly in cash. Each $50 security is convertible, at any time, into 0.25 shares of our common stock, which represents a conversion price of $200 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the junior convertible securities have no rights to put these securities to us. Upon conversion, holders will receive cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. We may redeem the junior convertible securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $260 per share for 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The junior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations, which require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense. These deductions result in annual deferred tax liabilities of $7.2 million. These deferred tax liabilities will be reclassified directly to stockholders’ equity if our common stock is trading above certain thresholds at the time of the conversion of the securities.

Equity Distribution Program
We have equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major securities firms under which we, from time to time, may issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to $500.0 million (the “equity distribution program”). As of December 31, 2017, no sales have occurred under the equity distribution program.

Affiliate Equity
Many of our consolidated Affiliate agreements provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. For equity method Affiliates, we do not typically have such put and call arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate’s cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.
As of December 31, 2017, our current redemption value of $811.9 million for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we paid $174.7 million for repurchases and collected $9.0 million for issuances of Affiliate equity during 2017. We expect to pay approximately $125 million for repurchases in 2018. In the event of a repurchase, we become the owner of the cash flow associated with the repurchased equity.

Commitments
We have committed to co-invest in certain Affiliate sponsored investment products. As of December 31, 2017, these unfunded commitments were $98.8 million and may be called in future periods.
As of December 31, 2017, we were contingently liable, upon achievement by certain Affiliates of specified financial targets, to make payments through 2019 related to our investments in these Affiliates. For our consolidated Affiliates, we were contingently liable for up to $18.2 million in payments, and expected to make payments of $10.2 million ($8.2 million in 2018). The present value of these expected payments was $9.4 million. For our equity method Affiliates, we were contingently liable to make payments up to $170.0 million through 2018, and expected to make no payments.
In addition, in connection with an investment in an Affiliate accounted for under the equity method, we entered into an arrangement with a minority owner of the Affiliate that gives such owner the right to sell a portion of its ownership interest in the Affiliate to us annually beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018. The purchase price of these conditional purchases will be at fair market value on the date of the transaction.
We and certain of our Affiliates operate under regulatory authorities that require the maintenance of minimum financial or capital requirements.

Share Repurchases
Our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs in January 2018, January 2017 and May 2015, authorizing us to repurchase up to 3.4 million, 1.9 million and 3.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively, and these

31

Table of Contents

authorizations have no expiry. Purchases may be made from time to time, at management’s discretion, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of derivatives and accelerated share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, we had repurchased all of the shares of the May 2015 authorized amount. As of the January 2018 authorization, there were a total of 5.0 million shares remaining available for repurchase under the January 2018 and January 2017 programs.

Changes in U.S. Tax Laws
On December 22, 2017, changes in U.S. tax laws were enacted, which significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings and profits. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a provisional one-time net benefit of $194.1 million from the changes in U.S. tax laws, primarily due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, principally deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets and convertible securities, partially offset by a transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings and profits. The re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities was primarily a non-cash item, and the transition tax was not significant and is payable over an eight year period. We do not expect the transition tax to have any significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We expect the changes in U.S. tax laws to result in an ongoing net benefit to our earnings and cash flows due to lower U.S. tax rates. The impact of the changes in U.S. tax laws may be refined as further guidance, interpretations or information become available or from further evaluation of the impact of the changes in U.S. tax laws. See Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Recent Accounting Developments
See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

32

Table of Contents

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.
The following are our critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and due to their nature, actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported.
Fair Value Measurements
Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
We make judgments to determine the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and equity interests when allocating the purchase price of our new investments, when revaluing our contingent payment arrangements, when we issue or repurchase Affiliate equity interests and when we test our intangible assets or equity and cost method investments for impairment.
In determining fair values for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, we typically use valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses, where we make assumptions about growth rates of assets under management, profitability and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts. In these analyses, we also consider historical and current market multiples, tax benefits, credit risk, interest rates, tax rates and discount rates. We consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to observed market transactions and, in certain instances, consulting with third-party valuation firms.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Our goodwill impairment assessments are performed annually (as of September 30th) at the reporting unit level which, in our case, is also our single global asset management operating segment, or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying value. If we determine that the fair value has declined below our related carrying value, an impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. For purposes of our assessment, we considered various qualitative factors (including market multiples for asset management businesses) and determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount, including goodwill.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Indefinite-lived intangible assets include investment advisory contracts between our Affiliates and their mutual funds and other retail-oriented investment products. Because the contracts are with the investment products themselves, and not with the underlying investors, and the contracts between our Affiliates and the investment products are typically renewed on an annual basis, industry practice under GAAP is to consider the contract life to be indefinite and, as a result, not amortizable.
We perform indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests annually, or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying value. If we determine that the fair value has declined below our related carrying value, an impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We completed our annual impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. For purposes of our assessment, we considered various qualitative factors (including market multiples) and determined that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each asset was greater than its carrying amount.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Definite-lived intangible assets include investment advisory contracts between our Affiliates and their underlying investors, and are amortized over their expected period of economic benefit. We monitor the expected period of economic benefit of these assets and revise it, if necessary. We review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future period of economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships. Significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed.
We perform definite-lived intangible asset impairment tests annually, or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying value. If we determine that the fair value has declined below our related carrying value, an impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We assess each of our definite-lived acquired

33

Table of Contents

client relationships for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired client relationships. We completed our annual assessment and noted that projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets exceed their carrying value and, accordingly, no impairments were identified.
Equity and Cost Method Investments
We evaluate equity and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other-than-temporary. If we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value.
During 2017, we determined that the fair value of an Equity method investment had declined below its carrying value. The decline in the fair value of this investment was the result of a cumulative decline in assets under management, coupled with the recent loss of a significant client, which has decreased the forecasted revenue of the firm. The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The significant assumptions used in the cash flow analysis include a projected growth rate of 10.0%, discount rates of 14.0% and 25.0% for asset and performance based fees, respectively, and a market participant tax rate of 25.0%. We considered the decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment of $93.1 million. For our remaining equity and cost method investments, we completed our annual evaluation and no impairments were identified.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. We measure our deferred taxes based on enacted tax rates and projected state apportionment percentages for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period in which the change in tax rates is enacted.
Our principal deferred tax assets relate to deferred compensation, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards and the indirect benefits of uncertain foreign tax positions. We regularly assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, considering all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.
We record unrecognized tax benefits based on whether it is more-likely-than-not that uncertain tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position. If it is determined an uncertain tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
Share-Based Compensation and Affiliate Equity
We have share-based compensation arrangements covering directors, senior management and employees (including our Affiliates). We calculate share-based compensation using the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Our share-based compensation arrangements typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment and, in some cases, are further subject to certain performance or market conditions. We recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, including grants that are subject to graded vesting.
We estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility and dividend yield of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options. In measuring expected volatility, we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock, as well as the current implied volatility from traded options.
For restricted stock awards with service or performance conditions, we determine the fair value of the awards using our share price on the date of grant and the number of awards that are expected to be delivered. For awards with market conditions, the fair value of the award is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation with inputs for expected volatility, a risk-free rate and expected dividends. Our estimate of expected volatility is developed in a manner consistent with that of our stock options.
From time to time, we grant equity interests in our Affiliates to Affiliate management and our officers, with vesting, forfeiture and repurchase terms established at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity interests is determined as of the date

of grant using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key valuation assumptions include projected assets under management, fee rates, tax rates and discount rates.
Redeemable non-controlling interests represent the currently redeemable value of Affiliate equity interests. We may pay for these Affiliate equity purchases in cash, shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration, at our election.
We generally value these interests upon their transfer or repurchase by applying market multiples to cash flows, which is intended to represent fair value. The use of different assumptions could change the value of these interests, including the amount of compensation expense, if any, that we may report upon their transfer or repurchase.
