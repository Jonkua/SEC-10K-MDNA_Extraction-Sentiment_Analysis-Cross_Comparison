Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Geographic Area Information. Northern Trust s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.
For purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest expense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding. Allocations of indirect noninterest expenses, when made, are based on various methods such as time, space, and number of employees.
The table below summarizes Northern Trust s performance based on the allocation process described above without regard to guarantors or the location of collateral.

Share-Based Compensation Plans. Northern Trust recognizes as compensation expense the grant-date fair value of stock and stock unit awards and other share-based compensation granted to employees within the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of stock and stock unit awards, including performance stock unit awards and director awards, are based on the closing price of the Corporation s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model utilizes weighted-average assumptions regarding the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding (expected term) based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants, the estimated yield from dividends paid on the Corporation s stock over the expected term of the options, the historical volatility of Northern Trust s stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Northern Trust stock, and a risk free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.
Compensation expense for share-based award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule, whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance stock unit awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on expected achievement of the performance condition.
Northern Trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur. Dividend equivalents are paid on performance stock unit awards granted prior to February 16, 2016 and restricted stock units granted prior to February 21, 2017 that are not yet vested. Dividend equivalents are accrued on performance stock unit awards granted on or after February 16, 2016, restricted stock units granted on or after February 21, 2017 and director awards not yet vested, and are paid upon vesting. Cash flows resulting from the realization of excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows.

Stockholders Equity
Preferred Stock. The Corporation is authorized to issue 10 million shares of preferred stock without par value. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the particular designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions for each series of preferred stock issued.
As of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had issued and outstanding 500,000 depositary shares (the Depositary Shares ), each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series D Preferred Stock ) issued in August 2016.

Common Stock. Stock repurchases through July 18, 2017 were made pursuant to the repurchase program announced by the Corporation on April 21, 2015, under which the Corporation s Board of Directors authorized the Corporation to repurchase up to 15.0 million shares of the Corporation s common stock. This program was terminated and replaced with a new repurchase program, announced on July 18, 2017, under which the Corporation s Board of Directors authorized the Corporation to repurchase up to 9.5 million shares of the Corporation s Common Stock. Repurchases after July 18, 2017 were made pursuant to the new repurchase program, which has no expiration date. Shares repurchased by the Corporation are used for general purposes, including management of the Corporation s capital levels and the issuance of shares under stock option and other incentive plans of the Corporation.

Floating Rate Capital Debt
In January 1997, the Corporation issued $150 million of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series A, through a statutory business trust wholly owned by the Corporation (NTC Capital I). In April 1997, the Corporation also issued, through a separate wholly owned statutory business trust (NTC Capital II), $120 million of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series B. The sole assets of the trusts are subordinated debentures of Northern Trust Corporation that have the same interest rates and maturity dates as the corresponding distribution rates and redemption dates of the Floating Rate Capital Securities. The Series A Securities were issued at a discount to yield 60.5 basis points above the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and are due January 15, 2027. The Series B Securities were issued at a discount to yield 67.9 basis points above the three-month LIBOR and are due April 15, 2027.
Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the regulatory capital treatment of these securities is required to be phased out over a period that began on January 1, 2013. In 2017, 50% of these securities are eligible for Tier 2 capital treatment, declining at an incremental 10% a year until they are fully phased out in 2022.
The Corporation has fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed all payments due on the Series A and B securities. The holders of the Series A and B securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions quarterly in arrears (based on the liquidation amount of $1,000 per security) at an interest rate equal to the rate on the corresponding subordinated debentures. The interest rate on the Series A and Series B securities is equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.52% and 0.59%, respectively. Subject to certain exceptions, the Corporation has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly periods provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity date. If interest is deferred on the subordinated debentures, distributions on the Series A and B securities will also be deferred and the Corporation will not be permitted, subject to certain exceptions, to pay or declare any cash distributions with respect to the Corporation s capital stock or debt securities that rank the same as or junior to the subordinated debentures, until all past due distributions are paid. The subordinated debentures are unsecured and subordinated to substantially all of the Corporation s existing indebtedness.
The Corporation has the right to redeem the Series A and Series B subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The following table summarizes the book values of the outstanding subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Variable Interest Entities
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Leveraged Leases. In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20-30% of the asset s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 70-80% provided by third party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs.
Northern Trust s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the leveraged lease trust VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets, were $131.0 million and $183.5 million, respectively. Northern Trust s funding requirements relative to the VIEs are limited to its invested capital. Northern Trust has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose Northern Trust to a loss.

Tax Credit Structures. Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs.
Northern Trust s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with community development projects is limited to the carrying amounts of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amounts of these investments in community development projects that generate tax credits, included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $415.3 million and $218.9 million, respectively, of which $386.1 million and $186.5 million are VIEs as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, liabilities related to unfunded commitments on investments in tax credit community development projects, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $241.1 million and $82.9 million, respectively, of which $215.2 million and $56.7 million related to undrawn commitments on VIEs as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Northern Trust s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. Northern Trust has no exposure to loss from liquidity arrangements and no obligation to purchase assets of the community development projects.
Tax credits and other tax benefits attributable to community development projects totaled $57.9 million and $48.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Investment Funds. Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.
Some of the funds for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and therefore the funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 810-10. Northern Trust voluntarily waived $1.0 million and $8.1 million of money market mutual fund fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Northern Trust does not have any contractual obligations to provide financial support to the funds. Any potential future support of the funds will be at the discretion of Northern Trust after an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances.
Periodically, Northern Trust makes seed capital investments to certain funds. As of December 31, 2017, Northern Trust had a $10.0 million investment, valued using net asset value per share and included in other assets, and no unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments. As of December 31, 2016, Northern Trust had no seed capital investments and no unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments.
