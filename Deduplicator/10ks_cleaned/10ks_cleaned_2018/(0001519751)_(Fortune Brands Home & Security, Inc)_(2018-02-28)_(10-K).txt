Overview
The Company is a leader in home and security products focused on the design, manufacture and sale of
market-leading branded products in the following categories: kitchen and bath cabinetry, plumbing and accessories, entry door systems, and security products.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales based on country of destination were:

------------------- - ------- --- -

(In millions)
United States $ 4,492.2 85 %
Canada 427.6 8
China 202.3 4
Other international 161.2 3
Total $ 5,283.3 100 %

We believe the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a diversified mix of customer channels,
lean and flexible supply chains, a decentralized business model and a strong capital structure as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in
order to drive increased shareholder value. We believe the Company’s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. As consumer demand and the housing market continue to grow after the
2007-2009 recession, we expect the benefits of operating leverage and strategic spending to support increased manufacturing capacity and long-term growth initiatives will help us to continue to achieve profitable organic growth.

We believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives. We also believe
that as the market grows, we have the potential to generate additional growth from leveraging our cash flows and balance sheet strength by pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, and by returning cash to shareholders through a
combination of dividends and repurchases under our share repurchase program as explained in further detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
The U.S. market for our home products consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing homes, with the substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of
repair and remodel spending. We believe that the U.S. market for our home products is in the midst of an elongated recovery from the U.S. economic recession that ended in mid-2009 and that a continued recovery
will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, home prices, stable mortgage rates and credit availability.
We may be impacted by fluctuations
in raw material, transportation costs, foreign exchange rates and promotional activity among our competitors. We strive to offset the potential unfavorable impact of these items with productivity improvements initiatives and price increases.

During the three years ended December 31, 2017, our net sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 7% as we benefited from an improving U.S. home
products market, acquisitions, and growth in international markets. Operating income grew at a compounded annual rate of 18% with consolidated operating margins improving from 10% in 2014 to 13% in 2017. Growth in operating income was primarily due
to higher sales volume, changes to our portfolio of businesses, control and leverage of our operating expenses and the benefits of productivity programs.

During 2017, the U.S. home products market grew due to increases in new home construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction
experienced 7.4% growth in 2017 compared to 2016 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased about 5%. In 2017, net sales grew 6% and operating income increased 9% due to higher sales volume primarily resulting from U.S. home products
market growth, the acquisitions in our Plumbing segments, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, the effect of favorable foreign exchange and productivity improvements.

During 2016, the U.S. home products market grew due to increases in new home construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction
experienced low double-digit growth in 2016 compared to 2015 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased about of 5%. In 2016, net sales grew 9% and operating income increased 28% due to higher sales volume primarily resulting from U.S.
home products market growth, the acquisitions in our Cabinets and Plumbing segments, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange and productivity improvements.

In October 2017, we acquired Victoria +Albert, a UK-based premium brand of standalone bathtubs, sink, tub fillers, faucets
and other accessories. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws, a UK-based luxury plumbing products company that specializes in manufacturing. The combined purchase price was approximately $125 million, net of
cash acquired and deferred acquisition payments and subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed both of the acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility. These transactions broadened our plumbing
portfolio and enhanced future growth opportunities.
During the third quarter of 2016, we announced the creation of GPG, which was designed to support
the growth of multiple plumbing brands with an enhanced set of products and brands, while leveraging Moen’s existing global supply chain and broad distribution network.
In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based luxury plumbing company and in a related transaction, we acquired TCL Manufacturing Ltd, which gave us ownership of Perrin & Rowe, a UK

manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We
financed both acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility. These transactions broadened the plumbing portfolio and enhanced future growth opportunities.
In June 2016, we amended and restated our credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Terms and
conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same. The revolving credit facility will mature in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes.

In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company specializing in premium showroom bath and shower fittings, for a total purchase price of
$94.6 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.
In September 2015, we completed the sale of Waterloo Industries, Inc. (“Waterloo”), our tool storage business which was included in our security segment for approximately $14 million in cash, subject
to certain post-closing adjustments.
In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes”) in a registered
public offering. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general purposes.
In May 2015,
we acquired Norcraft Companies, Inc. (“Norcraft”), a leading publicly-owned manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a total purchase price of $648.6 million. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings
under our existing credit facilities.

Certain items had a significant impact on our results in 2017, 2016 and 2015. These included the acquisitions of Victoria +Albert, Shaws, Riobel, ROHL,
Perrin & Rowe and Norcraft, the disposition of Waterloo, defined benefit plan recognition of actuarial losses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairment charges and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

In 2017, financial results included:

> the benefit of the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment,

> restructuring and other charges of $18.5 million before tax ($12.3 million after tax), primarily related to losses on disposal of inventory associated with exiting a product line in our Security segment and exiting a customer relationship in our Cabinets segment, as well as severance costs within our Security, Plumbing and Cabinets segments,

> impairment charge of $7.0 million pertaining to a cost method investment in a development stage home products company due to other-than-temporary decline in its fair value,

> the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian dollar, which had a favorable impact compared to 2016, of approximately $4 million on net sales, approximately $5 million on operating income and approximately $4 million on net income and

> an estimated net tax benefit of $25.7 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”).

In 2016, financial results included:

2017 Compared to 2016

Total Fortune Brands
Net sales

Net sales increased $298.4 million, or 6.0%. The increase was due to higher sales volume primarily from the continuing improvement in U.S. market conditions
for home products, new product introductions, the benefit from the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases as well as the benefit from favorable foreign exchange of
approximately $4 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher sales promotions, and sales rebates.
Cost of products
sold
Cost of products sold increased $170.5 million, or 5.4%, due to higher net sales, including the impact of the acquisitions in our
Plumbing segment and raw material cost increases, partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvements.

22

Table of Contents

Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.9 million, or 5.7%, due to higher employee-related costs and advertising costs as well as the impact of the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment.

Amortization of intangible assets
Amortization
of intangible assets increased $3.6 million primarily due to the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment, partially offset by a decrease relating to a definite-lived customer relationship intangible in our Doors segment that was fully amortized
during the second quarter of 2017.
Loss on sale of product line
In April 2017, we completed the sale of Field ID, our cloud-based inspection and safety compliance software product line included in our Security segment. We recorded a
pre-tax loss of $2.4 million as the result of this sale.
Asset impairment charges

Asset impairment charges of $3.2 million relate to our decision in the first quarter of 2017 to sell Field ID.

Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges of
$8.3 million in 2017 primarily related to severance costs within our Security, Plumbing and Cabinets segments as well as charges associated with a plant relocation in our Cabinets segment. Restructuring charges of $13.9 million in 2016
primarily related to the severance costs and charges associated with the relocation of a manufacturing facility within our Security segment.

Operating income
Operating income increased
$59.4 million or 9.4%. Operating income increased due to higher net sales, including the benefit from acquisitions in our Plumbing segment and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher
employee-related costs, raw material, labor inflation and advertising costs.
Interest expense

Interest expense of $49.4 million was $0.3 million higher as compared to last year primarily due to higher average interest rates which
was partially offset by lower average borrowings and the absence of the write-off of debt issuance costs incurred in 2016.
Other (income) expense, net
Other (income) expense, net, was expense of $7.9 million in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2017 compared to expense of $1.5 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $6.4 million was due to a $7.0 million impairment charge in 2017 pertaining to a cost method
investment.
Income taxes
The effective income
tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were 25.1% and 29.2% respectively. The 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, (the “Tax Act”).The effective income tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were favorably
impacted by the tax benefit attributable to share-based compensation (ASU 2016-09) deduction ($23.9 million and $27.8 million, respectively), the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code
Section 199) deduction ($10.9 million and

23

Table of Contents

$13.0 million, respectively) and favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions ($8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively), offset by state and local taxes and increases to
uncertain tax positions ($11.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively).
The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, generally providing for an exemption from federal income tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and imposing a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on our 2017 effective
income tax rate based upon available information, limited timing and our understanding of the Tax Act, as well as the facts and guidance available at our assessment date of January 22, 2018. The Company has recorded a provisional net benefit of
$25.7 million related to the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which it was enacted. This provisional amount includes an estimated reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of $62.4 million resulting
from the decrease in the federal income tax rate; an estimated deemed repatriation tax liability of $28.5 million; and an estimated net increase to our provision for taxes on foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested of
$8.2 million. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, refinement of calculations due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations, assumptions made and additional
guidance that may be issued. Any subsequent adjustment, related to the aforementioned, will be recorded in current tax expense when such analysis is completed or such guidance is issued.
Income from continuing operations
Net income from continuing operations was $475.3 million in 2017
compared to $412.4 million in 2016. The increase of $62.9 million was primarily due to higher operating income.
(Loss) income from
discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations of $2.6 million in 2017 primarily related to the prior sale of the Waterloo tool
storage business and Simonton window businesses. The income from discontinued operations of $0.8 million in 2016 included the effect of tax adjustments relating to the Waterloo business.
Results By Segment
Cabinets
Net sales increased $69.3 million, or 2.9%, due to higher sales volume driven primarily by continuing improvement in the U.S. home products market and the benefit from new product introductions, price
increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and a $3 million benefit from favorable foreign exchange. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher sales promotions.

Operating income increased $9.4 million, or 3.6%, due to the increase in net sales and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by
unfavorable mix, higher employee-related costs, higher labor inflation and higher transportation costs.
Plumbing

from new product introductions, higher sales in international markets, principally China, and the benefit from the acquisitions of Riobel, ROHL and Perrin & Rowe in 2016 as well as Shaws and Victoria +Albert in 2017. These benefits
were partially offset by higher sales rebates.
Operating income increased $37.3 million, or 11.4%, due to higher net sales, productivity
improvements and favorable mix as well as a $4 million benefit from favorable foreign exchange. These benefits were partially offset by employee-related costs, higher raw materials costs and higher advertising costs.

and leveraging sales on our existing fixed cost base.

net sales, the benefits from productivity improvements, lower restructuring and other charges (approximately $6 million) relating to the completion in 2016 of a manufacturing facility relocation, favorable foreign exchange and the related cost
savings resulting from the facility relocation.
Corporate
Corporate expenses increased by $5.7 million mainly due to the impairment of a long lived asset and recognition of an actuarial gain versus an actuarial loss in 2016 and higher defined benefit plan income
during 2017 compared to 2016.

In future periods the Company may record, in the Corporate segment, material expense or income associated with actuarial gains and
losses arising from periodic remeasurement of our liabilities for defined benefit plans. At a minimum the Company will remeasure its defined benefit plan liabilities in the fourth quarter of each year. Remeasurements due to plan amendments and
settlements may also occur in interim periods during the year. Remeasurement of these liabilities attributable to updating our liability discount rates and expected return on assets may, in particular, result in material income or expense
recognition.

$27 million and higher sales rebates.

$10.7 million, or 19% due to higher net sales and the benefits of productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of approximately $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.

Corporate

Corporate expenses in 2016 benefited from the absence of transaction costs associated with the Norcraft acquisition ($15.1 million in 2015). This benefit was
offset by higher employee-related costs and lower defined benefit plan income.

---------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- - ----- -

(In millions) 2016 2015
General and administrative expense $ (80.9 ) $ (70.1 )
Defined benefit plan income 2.9 6.1

Total Corporate expenses $ (79.9 ) $ (81.6 )

(a) Represents external costs directly related to the acquisition of Norcraft and primarily includes expenditures for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.

In future periods the Company may record,
in the Corporate segment, material expense or income associated with actuarial gains and losses arising from periodic remeasurement of our liabilities for defined benefit plans. At a minimum the Company will remeasure its defined benefit plan
liabilities in the fourth quarter of each year. Remeasurements due to plan amendments and settlements may also occur in interim periods during the year. Remeasurement of these liabilities attributable to updating our liability discount rates and
expected return on assets may, in particular, result in material income or expense recognition.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and service indebtedness, as well as
to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, availability under our credit
facility and debt issuances in the capital markets. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. In December 2017,
our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.20 per share of our common stock. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when
and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions to increase shareholder value. However, we cannot predict
whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or dispositions, make any purchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties, including those described in the section “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its credit
agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. This amendment and restatement of the credit agreement was a
non-cash transaction for the Company. Terms and conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same as under the 2011 credit agreement. The revolving credit
facility will mature in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under these facilities were $615.0 million and
$540.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the current portion of long-term debt was zero. Interest rates under the facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the

28

Table of Contents

borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.9% to LIBOR + 1.5%. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under this
facility. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote off prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3 million as of June 30, 2016. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” on January 1, 2016, resulting in the reclassification of approximately $3 million of debt issuance costs from other current assets and other assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.
Adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company’s equity, results of operations or cash flows.
On December 8, 2017, our Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of shares of our common stock over the two years ending December 8, 2019. As of December 31, 2017, total remaining available share repurchase authorization was
$558.4 million which included amounts pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization on February 16, 2016 for the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our common stock over the two years ended February 16, 2018. The share
repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In 2017, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the
Company’s share repurchase programs for $214.8 million.
We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide for
unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $23.5 million and $25.7 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which zero were outstanding, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The weighted-average
interest rates on these borrowings were zero, 1.5% and 1.0% in 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
Acquisitions and divestitures in 2017, 2016 and 2015
include:

> In October 2017, the Company acquired Victoria + Albert, a UK manufacturer of luxury freestanding tubs and basins. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws, a UK-based luxury plumbing products company that specializes in manufacturing and selling fireclay sinks. The combined purchase price was approximately $125 million, net of cash acquired and deferred acquisition payments and subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the Plumbing segment from the date of acquisitions. We financed the transactions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

> In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based luxury plumbing company. We also acquired Perrin & Rowe, a UK manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

> In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company for a purchase price of $94.6 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

> In September 2015, we completed the sale of the Waterloo tool storage business for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.

> In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft, a leading manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a purchase price of $648.6 million. We financed this transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

In 2017, we invested approximately $40 million
in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. We expect capital spending in 2018 to be in the range of $150 to $160 million.
On
December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $323.0 million, of which $260.5 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering
(i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record tax expense on those funds that are repatriated.

Our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our businesses. We typically generate most
of our operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
In June 2015, we issued $900 million of Senior Notes in a registered
public offering. The Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due 2020 with a coupon of 3% and $500 million of ten-year notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4%. We used the
proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of the Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions and price discounts, was
$892.6 million.
Cash Flows
Below is a
summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

--------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ------ ---- - ------ -

(In millions) 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 600.3 $ 650.5 $ 429.2
Net cash used in investing activities (287.7 ) (385.1 ) (766.6 )
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (250.1 ) (250.4 ) 398.8
Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash 9.0 (2.0 ) (14.8 )
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 71.5 $ 13.0 $ 46.6

Net cash provided by operating activities was $600.3 million in 2017 compared to $650.5 million in 2016 and
$429.2 million in 2015. The $50.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to higher build in working capital, primarily driven by higher inventory purchases in 2017, partially offset by
a higher net income. The $221.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in working capital in 2016 compared to 2015 and higher net income.

Net cash used in investing activities was $287.7 million in 2017 compared to $385.1 million in 2016 and $766.6 million in 2015. The decrease of
$97.4 million from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due lower cost of acquisitions of $115.1 million, partially offset by $15.7 million of higher capital expenditures. The decrease of $381.5 million from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due
the decrease in cost of acquisitions of $413.1 million, partially offset by $20.8 million of higher capital spending.
Net cash used in
financing activities was $250.1 million in 2017 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $250.4 million in 2016 and net cash provided by in financing activities of $398.8 million in 2015. The change of $649.2 million
in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $372.8 million of higher share repurchases and lower net borrowings of $240.8 million.

Pension Plans
Subsidiaries of Fortune Brands sponsor their
respective defined benefit pension plans that are funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within our benefit plan trust. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we contributed $28.4 million, zero and $2.3 million, respectively, to qualified
pension plans. In 2018, we expect to make pension contributions of approximately $12.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was $656.6 million, representing funding of 79% of the
accumulated benefit obligation liability. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.

Foreign Exchange
We have operations in various foreign
countries, principally Canada, China, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Japan. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

The following table describes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent
commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2017.

-------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ------- ---------------- - ----- --------- - --------- ------------- ----- - -----

(In millions) Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2017

Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years
Long-term debt $ 1,507.6 $ — $ 398.3 $ 615.0 $ 494.3
Interest payments on long-term debt(a) 238.0 49.0 91.0 48.0 50.0
Operating leases 158.2 31.0 47.6 28.9 50.7
Purchase obligations(b) 397.3 371.3 21.1 2.9 2.0
Deferred acquisition payments(c) 33.0 13.7 19.3 — —
Defined benefit plan contributions(d) 12.9 12.9 — — —
Total $ 2,347.0 $ 477.9 $ 577.3 $ 694.8 $ 597.0

(a) Interest payments on long-term debt were calculated using the borrowing rate in effect on December 31, 2017.

(b) Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures.

(c) In addition to deferred acquisition payments relating to Victoria + Albert and Shaws, the acquisition of Victoria + Albert includes certain payments up to $9.6 million that are contingent on continued employment for one year after the acquisition date.

(d) Pension and postretirement contributions cannot be determined beyond 2018.

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of
the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $87.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above. In addition, we are still
evaluating our options regarding the timing of the payment of the deemed repatriation tax liability resulting from the Tax Act. Therefore we have excluded the provisional $28.5 million deemed repatriation tax liability from the Contractual
Obligations table above. See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments listed and described above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently
liable as of December 31, 2017. Other corporate commercial commitments include standby letters of credit of $42.9 million, in the aggregate, all of which expire in less than one year, and surety bonds of $5.1 million, of which
$5.0 million matures in less than 1 year and $0.1 million matures in 1-3 years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial condition or results
of operations.
Foreign Currency Risk
Certain
anticipated transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan. We regularly monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to
maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. For additional information on this risk, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Derivative Financial Instruments
In accordance with ASC requirements for Derivatives and Hedging, we recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, and the measurement of those instruments is at fair

31

Table of Contents

value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in
the consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as an effective economic hedge of the
net investment in a foreign operation, the changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment section of OCI. Similar to foreign currency translation adjustments, these changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings only when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.

Deferred currency gains/(losses) of $0.4 million, (3.5) million and $3.6 million (before tax impact) were reclassified into earnings for the year ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that $3.0 million of net currency derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2017 will be reclassified
to earnings within the next twelve months.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, which clarifies the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and specifies the disclosures that an entity
should include in its financial statements. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (calendar year 2018 for Fortune Brands). During 2016, the FASB issued certain amendments to the standard
relating to the principal versus agent guidance, accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations as well as the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and
other similar taxes. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as those of the original ASU. Our key considerations pursuant to ASU 2014-09 during the assessment period
were the control of goods (i.e., timing of revenue recognition), separate performance obligations and customer rights of return (i.e., the reclassification on the balance sheet of the customer rights of return from accounts receivable to a refund
liability as well as the recognition of a corresponding asset). We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial
statements.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a “right-of-use”
asset and lease liability but recognize related expenses in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018 (calendar year 2019 for Fortune Brands) and earlier application is permitted. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Clarifying Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05 that clarifies the scope and application of various standards for the sale of nonfinancial assets (e.g. PP&E including real estate, intangible assets, materials and
supplies). The standard distinguishes between a sale to customer vs non-customer. Sales to customers are in scope of the new revenue standard. It also clarifies a derecognition model for nonfinancial assets
that do not represent a business. We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018 consistent with the effective date for the new revenue recognition standard. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

32

Table of Contents

Stock Compensation Scope of Modification Accounting
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The
new guidance provides a relief to entities that make non-substantive changes to their share-based payment awards and will result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications.
We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Cost

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires entities to present the service cost component of the net
periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets.
Companies will present the other components (i.e., amortization of prior service cost/credits, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and actuarial gains/losses) separately from the line item(s) that includes the service cost and outside of
any subtotal of operating income. We will retrospectively adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Clarifying the Definition of a Business
In January 2017,
the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, which changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business and therefore business combination
guidance would apply. The new standard requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset (i.e., a business) or a group of similar identifiable assets
(i.e., not a business). The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs (e.g., revenues with customers). We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The
adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, according to which entities are no longer required to present transfers
between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The prior standard did not address the classification of activity related to restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the
statement of cash flows and this has resulted in diversity in cash flows presentation. We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than
inventory (e.g., intangible assets) when the transfer occurs. Under the current guidance companies are required to defer the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise
recognized (e.g., depreciated, amortized or impaired). We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018 using a “modified retrospective” (i.e., with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at adoption). The adoption of
this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

In September 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which changes how an entity classifies certain cash receipts and cash
payments on its statement of cash flows. The key changes that may potentially impact

33

Table of Contents

our financial statements include the following: 1) Cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs would be classified as financing cash outflows; 2) Contingent consideration payments
that are not made within three months after the consummation of a business combination would be classified as financing (if the payment is made up to the acquisition date fair value of liability) or operating outflows (if in excess of acquisition
fair value). Cash payments made “soon after” the consummation of a business combination generally would be classified as cash outflows for investing activities; 3) Insurance settlement proceeds would be classified based on the nature of
the loss; and 4) Company-owned life insurance settlement proceeds would be presented as investing cash inflows, and premiums would be classified as investing or operating cash outflows, or a combination of both. We will retrospectively adopt the new
standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
which requires entities to measure investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) at fair value through the income statement. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (with changes in fair value reported in Other Comprehensive Income). In addition, the cost method is eliminated for equity investments without readily determinable fair
values. We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 that amends current hedge accounting model. The new standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a
hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item (which is consistent with our current practice). The change in fair value for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges will be included in Other
comprehensive income (until they are reclassified into the income statement). The standard also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The standard is effective as of January 1, 2019 and earlier application is permitted. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance applies to most financial assets measured
at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables and loans as well as off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments and standby letters of credit). The standard will replace the
“incurred loss” approach under the current guidance with an “expected loss” model that requires an entity to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss.” The standard is effective January 1, 2020 and early
application is permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets
and liabilities reflected in the financial statements and revenues and expenses reported for the relevant reporting periods. We believe the policies discussed below are the Company’s critical accounting policies as they include the more
significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates made when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with
potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency) or discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include provisions for certain customers
where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined that the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet
be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience and existing economic conditions.
In accordance with this policy, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.3 million and $7.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Inventories
Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value for
obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage and specific identification of items, such as product
discontinuance, engineering/material changes, or regulatory-related changes. In accordance with this policy, our inventory provision was $45.0 million and $36.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Long-lived Assets
In accordance with ASC requirements for
Property, Plant and Equipment, a long-lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group held for use is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not
be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. The cash
flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is
estimated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows on a market-participant basis.
Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth
quarter, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is performed if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a weighting of the income (80%) and market (20%) approaches. For the income approach, we use a discounted cash
flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates and then discounting the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived weighted-average cost of capital. In determining the estimated future cash
flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on management’s plans for that business; business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions; and market-participant considerations. Furthermore, our cash flow
projections used to assess impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets are significantly influenced by our projection for the continued recovery of the U.S. home products market, our annual operating plans finalized in the fourth quarter
of each year, and our ability to execute on various planned cost reduction initiatives supporting operating income improvements. Our projection for the U.S. home products market is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors, such as
employment, home prices, credit availability, new home starts and the rate of home foreclosures.

35

Table of Contents

For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to the current operating results of the reporting units to determine each reporting unit’s fair value. The Company’s
reporting units are operating segments. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss based on that difference, if any.

The significant assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for goodwill impairment testing include the following: third-party market forecasts
of U.S. new home starts and home repair and remodel spending; management’s sales, profit and cash flow forecasts; peer company EBITDA earnings multiples; the market-participant-based weighted-average cost of capital; and the perpetuity growth
rate. Our estimates of reporting unit fair values are based on certain assumptions that may differ from our historical and future actual operating performance. Specifically, assumptions related to growth in the new construction and repair and
remodel segments of the U.S. home products markets drive our forecasted sales growth. The market forecasts are developed using independent third-party forecasts from multiple sources. In addition, estimated future profit margins and cash flow
consider our historical performance at similar levels of sales volume and management’s future operating plans as reflected in annual and long-term plans that are reviewed and approved by management.

Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. The determination of the
useful life of an intangible asset other than goodwill is based on factors including historical and tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing tradename support and
promotion, customer attrition rates, and other relevant factors. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth
quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impairment of that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
The significant assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for indefinite-lived intangible asset testing are third-party market forecasts of U.S. new home starts and home repair and remodel spending; management’s sales and
profit margin forecasts; the market-participant weighted-average cost of capital; and the perpetuity growth rate. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
We measure fair value of our indefinite-lived tradenames using the standard relief-from-royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the
remaining useful life. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors include changes in volume, customers and the industry. If it is
deemed more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired, we will perform a quantitative impairment test.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not
record any asset impairment charges in operating income associated with goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of two tradenames in the Cabinets segment exceeded their carrying values by less
than 10%. Accordingly, a reduction in the estimated fair value of these tradenames could trigger an impairment. As of December 31, 2017, the total carrying value of these tradenames was $217.8 million.

Defined Benefit Plans
We have a number of pension plans in
the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees. In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees. Service cost for 2017 relates to benefit accruals in an hourly Union
defined benefit plan in our Security segment. Benefit accruals under all other defined benefit pension plans were frozen as of December 31, 2016.

We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of
10 percent of the greater of the fair value of pension plan assets or each plan’s projected benefit obligation (the “corridor”) in earnings immediately upon remeasurement, which is at least annually in the fourth quarter of each
year. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the assumptions used to value defined benefit plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and
losses are changes in the discount rate used to value obligations as of the measurement date and the differences between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets. This accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult
to forecast gains and losses. The pre-tax recognition of actuarial (gains) losses was $(0.5) million, $1.9 million and $2.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total net actuarial
losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for all defined benefit plans were $67.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $73.4 million as of December 31, 2016.

We record amounts relating to these defined benefit plans based on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation
increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. We believe that the assumptions utilized in
recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect our financial condition or
results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and our expectations for long-term rates of return. The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. The
discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot-rate yield curve on a plan-by-plan basis that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate
interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the discount rate is from the top quartile of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and
includes only non-callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable with a Moody’s credit rating of Aa or higher. The weighted-average discount rate for defined benefit liabilities as
of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 3.8% and 4.3%, respectively.
For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on
historical cost increases and expectations for long-term increases. As of December 31, 2017, for postretirement medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.1% for pre-65 retirees and 8.4% for post-65 retirees, declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 4.5% per year in 2026. As of December 31, 2016, for
postretirement medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.3% for pre-65 retirees and 8.2% for post-65 retirees,
declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 4.5% per year in 2026.
Below is a table showing
pre-tax pension and postretirement expenses, including the impact of actuarial gains and losses:

--------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ----- ---- - ----- -

(In millions) 2017 2016 2015
Total pension expense $ (2.5 ) $ 6.8 $ 8.0
Actuarial loss component of expense above 0.9 — 2.9
Total postretirement income (6.5 ) (11.3 ) (13.2 )
Actuarial (gain) loss component of expense above (1.4 ) 1.9 (0.4 )
Amortization of prior service credit component of expense above (5.1 ) (13.5 ) (13.5 )

The actuarial gains in 2017 were principally due to normal re-measurement of prior year
defined benefit plan liabilities. The actuarial losses in 2016 were principally due to the re-measurement relating to a retiree medical plan. The actuarial losses in 2015 were due to lower asset returns,
partially offset by higher

discount rates. Discount rates in 2017 used to determine benefit obligations decreased by an average of 50 basis points for pension benefits. Discount rates for postretirement benefits remained
the same in 2017. Discount rates in 2016 used to determine benefit obligations decreased by an average of 30 basis points for pension benefits and an average of 70 basis points for postretirement benefits. Discount rates in 2015 used to
determine benefit obligations increased by an average of 40 basis points for pension benefits and an average of 50 basis points for postretirement benefits. The changes in discount rates was due to changes in interest rates for the bond portfolio
that comprises our spot-rate yield curve. Our spot-rate yield curve is based on high quality bond interest rates. Our actual return on plan assets in 2017 was 16.3% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 6.4% expected return. Our
actual return on plan assets in 2016 was 10.0% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 6.6% expected return. Significant actuarial losses in future periods would be expected if discount rates decline, actual returns on plan assets are
lower than our expected return, or a combination of both occurs.
A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or
decrease in our pension and postretirement liability of approximately $27 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term rate of return on plan assets used in accounting for our pension plans would have a $1.6 million impact
on pension expense. In addition, if required, actuarial gains and losses will be recorded in accordance with our defined benefit plan accounting method as previously described. It is not possible to forecast or predict whether there will
be actuarial gains and losses in future periods, and if required, the magnitude of any such adjustment. These gains and losses are driven by differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions that are beyond our control, such as
changes in interest rates and the actual return on pension plan assets.
Income Taxes
In accordance with ASC requirements for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect
changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We record a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is recognition, where
we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax
positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the
benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to
individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2017, we had
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $87.5 million. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $1.5 million to $21.5 million in the
next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.
On December 22, 2017, Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued regarding the application of U.S. GAAP to situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable
detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have calculated and included our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in our year end income tax provision. In accordance with our
understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available, a provisional net tax benefit of $25.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. This provisional amount includes a tax benefit of $62.4 million due to the remeasurement of the
Company’s net deferred tax liabilities, tax expense on

deemed repatriation of foreign earnings of $28.5 million and tax expense of $8.2 million on foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested. The impact of the Tax Act may differ
from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, refinement of calculations due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations, assumptions made and additional guidance that may be issued. Any subsequent adjustment, related
to the aforementioned, will be recorded in current tax expense when such analysis is completed or such guidance is issued.
Customer Program Costs

Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in our businesses. Our businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product
placement, to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for in either “net sales” or the category
“selling, general and administrative expenses” at the time the program is initiated and/or the revenue is recognized. The costs are predominantly recognized in “net sales” and include, but are not limited to, volume allowances
and rebates, promotional allowances, and cooperative advertising programs. These costs are recorded at the later of the time of sale or the implementation of the program based on management’s best estimates. Estimates are based on historical
and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Volume allowances are accrued based on management’s estimates of customer volume achievement and other factors incorporated into customer agreements, such as new products, store
sell-through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume
expectations). The costs typically recognized in “selling, general and administrative expenses” include product displays, point of sale materials and media production costs.
Litigation Contingencies
Our businesses are subject to risks related to threatened or pending litigation and
are routinely defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of business. Liabilities and costs associated with litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and
circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record liabilities for litigation-related losses when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in accordance with ASC requirements for
Contingencies. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period based on the then-current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of
litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at any particular balance sheet date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.

Environmental Matters
We are involved in remediation
activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from
other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate
to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of
December 31, 2017, eleven such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In 2017, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in a new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved.
In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for
PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,

cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had accruals of $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, relating to environmental compliance and cleanup
including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").
