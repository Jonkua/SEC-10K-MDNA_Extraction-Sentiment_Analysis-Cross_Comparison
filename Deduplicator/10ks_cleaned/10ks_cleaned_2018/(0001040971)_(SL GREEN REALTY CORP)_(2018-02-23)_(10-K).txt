ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
SL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as SL Green or the Company, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Company is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management and operation of commercial and residential real estate properties, principally office properties, located in the New York metropolitan area. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership.
Reckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the SL Green Realty Corp.
The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Leasing and Operating
In 2017, our same-store Manhattan office property occupancy based on leases signed was 95.3% compared to 95.9% in the prior year. We signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing approximately 1.5 million square feet, of which approximately 0.9 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. Our mark-to-market on these approximately 1.5 million square feet of signed Manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was 11.3% for 2017.
According to Cushman & Wakefield, new leasing activity in Manhattan in 2017 totaled approximately 30.5 million square feet. Of the total 2017 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 19.7 million square feet, or approximately 64.6%. Manhattan's overall office vacancy decreased from 9.3% at December 31, 2016 to 8.9% at December 31, 2017. Overall average asking rents in Manhattan decreased in 2017 by 0.8% from $72.82 per square foot at December 31, 2016 to $72.25 per square foot at December 31, 2017, while Manhattan Class A asking rents increased to $79.05 per square foot, up 0.8% from $78.43 one year ago.
Acquisition and Disposition Activity
Overall Manhattan sales volume decreased by 45.5% in 2017 to $21.6 billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2016. Consistent with our multi-faceted approach to property acquisitions, we selectively sourced the purchase of an interest in Worldwide Plaza, a Class A asset located in Midtown Manhattan.
We also continued to take advantage of significant interest by both international and domestic institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in Manhattan properties to sell assets, disposing of a significant volume of properties that were non-core or had more limited growth opportunities, raising efficiently priced capital that was used primarily for debt reduction and stock repurchases. During the year, we sold all or part of our interest in 680-750 Washington Boulevard, 102 Greene Street, 520 White Plains Road, 16 Court Street, and 125 Chubb for total gross valuations of $362.0 million, and sold a 30.13% interest in 1515 Broadway at a gross valuation of $1.95 billion, which did not meet the criteria for sale accounting in 2017. We achieved sale accounting upon adoption of ASC 610-20 in January 2018 and closed on the sale of an additional 12.87% interest in this property in February 2018. Additionally, in 2017 we entered a contract to sell 600 Lexington Avenue for a gross asset valuation of $305.0 million. This transaction closed in January 2018.
Debt and Preferred Equity
In 2016 and 2017, in our debt and preferred equity portfolio we continued to focus on the origination of financings, typically in the form of mezzanine debt, for owners, acquirers or developers of properties in the markets in which we operate, primarily the New York metropolitan area. This investment strategy provides us with the opportunity to fill a need for additional debt financing, while achieving attractive risk adjusted returns to us on the investments and receiving a significant amount of additional information on the New York metropolitan area real estate market. The typical investments made by us during 2016 and 2017 were to reputable owners or acquirers which have sizable equity subordinate to our last dollar exposure. During 2017, our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations, inclusive of advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization, of $1,287 million, and sales, redemption and participations of $813 million.

For descriptions of significant activities in 2017, refer to "Part I, Item 1. Business - Highlights from 2017."

Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Investment in Commercial Real Estate Properties
Real estate properties are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs directly related to the development or redevelopment of properties are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
We recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity at their respective fair values on the acquisition date.
We incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year after major construction activity ceases. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.
On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be other than temporarily impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property.
We also evaluate our real estate properties for impairment when a property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation expense is no longer recorded. See Note 4, "Properties Held for Sale and Dispositions."
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control or which are variable interest entities (each, a "VIE") and where we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. In all these joint ventures, the rights of the joint venture partner are both protective as well as participating. Unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, these participating rights preclude us from consolidating these VIE entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. Equity in net income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on our ownership or economic interest in each joint venture. When a capital event (as defined in each joint venture agreement) such as a refinancing occurs, if return thresholds are met, future equity income will be allocated at our increased economic interest. We recognize incentive income from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as income to the extent it is earned and not subject to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support. None of the joint venture debt is recourse to us. The Company has performance guarantees under master leases at two joint ventures. See Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures."
We assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint ventures' projected discounted cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired at December 31, 2017.

We may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction, where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with the accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.
Revenue Recognition
Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. We establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future potential tenant credit losses, which may occur against this account. The balance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is net of such allowance.
We record a gain on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer, subject to the buyer's financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and provided that we have no substantial economic involvement with the buyer.
Interest income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when, in the opinion of management, it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt.
Deferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to the interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield.
Debt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition on any non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is resumed when such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Interest is recorded as income on impaired loans only to the extent cash is received.
We may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we derecognize the loan sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income.
Asset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If the financial condition of a specific tenant were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
Reserve for Possible Credit Losses
The expense for possible credit losses in connection with debt and preferred equity investments is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for possible credit losses to the level that we estimate to be adequate, based on Level 3 data, considering delinquencies, loss experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered include geographic trends, product diversification, the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions. Based upon these factors, we establish a provision for possible credit loss on each individual investment. When it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, the investment is considered impaired.
Where impairment is indicated on an investment that is held to maturity, a valuation allowance is measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral. Any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the calculated value of the collateral is charged to expense. We continue to assess or adjust our estimates based on circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral. If additional information reflects increased recovery of our investment, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. There were no loan reserves recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

Debt and preferred equity investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its net carrying value to debt and preferred equity investments held to maturity. For these reclassified investments, the difference between the current carrying value and the expected cash to be collected at maturity will be accreted into income over the remaining term of the investment.
Derivative Instruments
In the normal course of business, we use a variety of commonly used derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. Effectiveness is essential for those derivatives that we intend to qualify for hedge accounting. Some derivative instruments are associated with an anticipated transaction. In those cases, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract.
To determine the fair values of derivative instruments, we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives, long-term investments and long-term debt, standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Reconciliation of Net Income to Same-Store Operating Income
We present Same-Store Operating Income because we believe that this measure, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and our reconciliation, provides investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP. Same-Store Operating Income provides information on trends in the revenue generated and expenses incurred in operating our properties, unaffected by the cost of leverage, depreciation, amortization, and other net income components. We use this metric internally as a performance measure. This measure is not an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and same-store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance.

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues
Rental revenues decreased primarily as a result of Disposed Properties ($239.7 million), which included 388-390 Greenwich Street and the effect of the partial sale and deconsolidation of 11 Madison Avenue in the third quarter of 2016. This decrease was offset by increased rental revenue at Same-Store Properties ($19.1 million), and by 1515 Broadway which, in 2016, recognized accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale following the tenant's bankruptcy.

Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $35.19 per rentable square feet for 96,688 rentable square feet.

Investment Income
Investment income decreased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million) in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by income related to our preferred equity investment in 885 Third Avenue ($16.9 million) and a larger weighted average book balance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.9 billion and 9.3% excluding our investment in Two Herald Square which was put on non-accrual in August 2017, respectively, compared to $1.5 billion and 9.7%, respectively, for the same period in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the debt and preferred equity investments had a weighted average term to maturity of 2.2 years excluding extension options and our investment in Two Herald Square.
Other Income
Other income decreased primarily as a result of the termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citigroup, Inc. at 388-390 Greenwich in 2016 ($94.0 million) and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33

Beekman in the second quarter of 2016 ($10.8 million). The decrease was partially offset by net fees recognized in connection with the One Vanderbilt venture in 2017 ($13.3 million).
Property Operating Expenses
Property operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of Disposed Properties ($33.4 million) partially offset by increased real estate taxes at our Same-Store Properties ($8.2 million).
Transaction Related Costs
The decrease in transaction related costs in 2017 is primarily due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 in 2017, which clarified the definition of a business and provided guidance to assist in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. Following the adoption of the guidance, most of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions and transaction costs are therefore capitalized to the investment basis when they would have previously been expensed under the previous guidance. Transaction costs expensed in 2017 relate primarily to transactions that are not moving forward for which any costs incurred are expensed.
Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $100.5 million, including a $4.1 million charge related to forfeiture of the Company's 2014 Outperformance Plan awards, or 5.3% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $99.8 million, or 4.7% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2016.
Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income
Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the Disposed Properties ($72.2 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding was $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The consolidated weighted average interest rate was 4.00% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the Disposed Properties ($448.9 million), partially offset by accelerated amortization at 5-7 Dey Street, 183 & 187 Broadway upon the commencement of demolition of the properties ($32.0 million).
Equity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate
Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased primarily as a result of the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($13.0 million), as well as higher net income contributions from 1745 Broadway ($7.3 million) and 605 West 42nd Street ($3.5 million) in 2017. These increases were partially offset by lower net income contributions from 280 Park Avenue ($5.7 million) as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs in conjunction with the refinancing of the debt on the property, reduced occupancy at 3 Columbus Circle ($3.9 million), and revenues from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016, and repaid in the second quarter of 2017 ($2.7 million).
Equity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
During the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale related to our interests in 747 Madison Avenue ($13.0 million), 102 Greene Street ($0.3 million) and part of our interest in the Stonehenge Portfolio ($0.9 million). The sale of 747 Madison, which occurred in 2014, did not meet the criteria for sale accounting at that time and, therefore, remained on our consolidated financial statement until the criteria was met in the second quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, in which we recognized a gain on the sale of our interests in 33 Beekman Street ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($3.1 million).
Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of the property at 16 Court Street ($64.9 million), and the partial sale of the property at 102 Greene Street ($4.9 million). This gain was partially offset by a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($8.8 million) which closed in 2016, but was only recognized in the second quarter of 2017 due to the sale not meeting the criteria for sale accounting under the full accrual method in ASC 360-20 until the second quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 388-390 Greenwich ($206.5 million), a 49% interest in 400 East 57th Street ($23.9 million), 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), and a 40% interest in 11 Madison Avenue ($3.6 million), partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million).

Rental, Escalation and Reimbursement Revenues
Rental revenues increased primarily as a result of the properties acquired ($98.2 million), which included the acquisition of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($59.2 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($19.3 million), and an increase in rents at our Same-Store Properties ($19.1 million). In addition, rental revenues increased as a result of the accelerated recognition of non-cash deferred income from 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citigroup, Inc. ("Citi") exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($37.1 million). This increase was partially offset by the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the third quarter of 2015 ($18.3 million), the sale of 885 Third Avenue in the first quarter of 2016 ($11.9 million), as well as accounting write-offs ($17.4 million) and decreased cash revenue ($2.0 million) related to the space previously leased to Aeropostale at 1515 Broadway following the tenant's bankruptcy.
Escalation and reimbursement revenue increased primarily as a result of higher real estate tax recoveries at the Same-Store Properties ($14.9 million) and Acquisition Properties ($7.6 million) attributable to an increase in the related tax expense. This was partially offset by decreased real estate tax recoveries due to the sale of 120 West 45th Street ($2.3 million), and 140 Grand Street ($1.3 million).
Occupancy in our Same-Store Manhattan consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced was 95.9% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2015. Occupancy for our Same-Store Suburban consolidated office operating portfolio, excluding leases signed but not yet commenced, increased to 84.4% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 81.4% at December 31, 2015.
The following table presents a summary of the commenced leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 in our Manhattan and Suburban portfolio:

Average starting office rent for office space (leased and early renewals, excluding new tenants replacing vacancies) was $35.86 per rentable square feet for 63,040 rentable square feet.

Investment Income
Investment income increased primarily as a result of additional income recognized from the recapitalization of a debt investment ($41.0 million). This increase was partially offset by a lower weighted average yield and balance for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the weighted average debt and preferred equity investment balance outstanding and weighted average yield were $1.5 billion and 9.7%, respectively, compared to $1.7 billion and 10.3%, respectively, for the same period in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the debt and preferred equity investments had a fully extended weighted average term to maturity of 3.0 years.
Other Income
Other income increased primarily as a result of the lease termination fee earned in connection with the termination of the lease with Citi at 388-390 Greenwich Avenue ($94.0 million), and promote income earned in connection with the sale of 33

52

Table of Contents

Beekman ($10.8 million), which was partially offset by a lease termination fee received at 919 Third Avenue in 2015 ($11.3 million).
Property Operating Expenses
Property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of properties acquired ($25.9 million), which includes the acquisition 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($9.9 million), the consolidation of 600 Lexington Avenue ($8.6 million) in the fourth quarter if 2015, and higher operating expenses at the Same-Store Properties ($15.5 million) primarily driven by real estate taxes ($13.5 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses stemming from our sold properties ($17.7 million), which included the sale of 120 West 45th St in the third quarter of 2015 ($9.8 million).
Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $99.8 million, or 4.7% of total combined revenues, including our share of joint venture revenues, and 53 basis points of total combined assets, including our share of joint venture assets compared to $94.9 million, or 5.0% of total revenues including our share of joint venture revenues, and 44 basis points of total combined assets including our share of joint venture assets for 2015.
Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income
Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 388-390 Greenwich Street in the second quarter of 2016 ($16.5 million), and the sale of 120 West 45th Street in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($7.7 million). These decreases were partially offset by the mortgage related to the acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue in the third quarter of 2015 ($20.8 million). The weighted average consolidated debt balance outstanding increased to $9.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate was 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the accelerated depreciation expense related to 388-390 Greenwich Street as a result of Citi exercising its option to purchase the property and entering into an agreement to accelerate the sale ($329.7 million). The increase is also driven by the acquisition of 100% interest of 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2015 together with the subsequent sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016 ($52.5 million). These increases were partially offset by the accelerated depreciation in 2015 related to vacating the properties that comprise the One Vanderbilt development site ($146.6 million).
Equity in Net Income in Unconsolidated Joint Venture/Real Estate
Equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased primarily as a result of the sale of a 40% interest in 11 Madison in the third quarter of 2016. The sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting until December 2016 resulting in recognition of the other partner's share of depreciation ($8.4 million) in addition to our share of the operations of the property. The decrease was partially offset by an increase at 1552-1560 Broadway ($4.6 million) as a result of the settlement in February 2016 of arbitration regarding a tenant's rent at the property and revenue from a debt and preferred equity investment that was contributed to a joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 ($4.5 million), and from the increase at 650 Fifth Avenue as a result of the loan refinance in the third quarter of 2016 ($3.6 million).
Equity in Net Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
During the year ended December 31, 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale of 33 Beekman Street ($33.0 million), 7 Renaissance Square ($4.2 million), 1 Jericho ($3.3 million) and EOP Denver ($3.1 million), compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sale of our joint venture interest at 315 West 36th Street ($16.3 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of our joint venture interest at the Meadows ($1.6 million).
Purchase Price Fair Value Adjustment
The purchase price fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in 600 Lexington Avenue.
Gain on Sale of Real Estate
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of 388-390 Greenwich ($206.5 million), a 49% interest in 400 East 57th Street ($23.9 million), 248-252 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, New York ($15.3 million), and a 40% interest in 11 Madison Avenue ($3.6 million), partially offset by the loss on the sale of 7 International Drive, Westchester County, NY ($6.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recognized a gain on sale associated with the sales of an 80% interest in 131-137 Spring Street ($101.1 million), 120 West 45th Street ($58.6 million), 570 & 574 Fifth Avenue ($24.6 million), partially offset by a loss on the sale of 885 Third Avenue ($6.6 million).

Depreciable Real Estate Reserves
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of 500 West Putnam ($10.4 million), as compared to the same period in 2015 when we recognized depreciable real estate reserves related to the sale of two properties ($19.2 million).
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the gain recognized on the sale of 180 Maiden Lane ($17.0 million) and the related results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2015 which raised the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations to dispositions which represent a strategic shift in an entity’s operations. The guidance was applied prospectively for new disposals. As a result, the results of operations for 388-390 Greenwich Street, which was classified as held for sale at March 31, 2016, 500 West Putnam Avenue, which was classified as held for sale at June 30, 2016 and 400 East 57th Street which was held for sale at September 30, 2016, are included in continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital, acquisitions, development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, common share repurchases, repurchases or repayments of outstanding indebtedness (which may include exchangeable debt) and for debt and preferred equity investments may include:

--- --------------------------
(1) Cash flow from operations;

--- -------------
(2) Cash on hand;

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Net proceeds from divestitures of properties and redemptions, participations and dispositions of debt and preferred equity investments;

--- ------------------------------------------
(4) Borrowings under the 2017 credit facility;

--- --------------------------------------------------
(5) Other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Proceeds from common or preferred equity or debt offerings by the Company, the Operating Partnership (including issuances of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and Trust preferred securities) or ROP.

Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. Additionally, we believe that our debt and preferred equity investment program will continue to serve as a source of operating cash flow.
The combined aggregate principal maturities of our property mortgages and other loans payable, corporate obligations and our share of joint venture debt, including as-of-right extension options, as of December 31, 2017 were as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2017, we had $156.5 million of consolidated cash on hand, inclusive of $28.6 million of marketable securities. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to divest of properties or interests in properties or access private and public debt and equity capital when the opportunity presents itself, although there is no guarantee that this capital will be made available to us at efficient levels or at all. Management believes that these sources of liquidity, if we are able to access them, along with potential refinancing opportunities for secured debt, will allow us to satisfy our debt obligations, as described above, upon maturity, if not before.
We also have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners who we consider to be financially stable and who have the ability to fund a capital call when needed. Most of our joint ventures are financed with non-recourse debt. We believe that property level cash flows along with unfunded committed indebtedness and proceeds from the refinancing of outstanding secured indebtedness will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our joint venture properties.

Cash Flows
The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the years presented below.
Cash and cash equivalents were $127.9 million and $279.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a decrease of $151.5 million. The decrease was a result of the following changes in cash flows (in thousands):

--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -------- ---- ------------------ ---------- - - ---------- -

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 (Decrease)Increase
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 548,373 $ 634,714 $ (86,341 )
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (18,851 ) $ 2,122,570 $ (2,141,421 )
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (681,077 ) $ (2,733,240 ) $ 2,052,163

Our principal source of operating cash flow is related to the leasing and operating of the properties in our portfolio. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service, and fund quarterly dividend and distribution requirements. Our debt and preferred equity investments and joint venture investments also provide a steady stream of operating cash flow to us.
Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills, and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, we used cash primarily for the following investing activities (in thousands):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- ---------- -

Acquisitions of real estate $ 24,080
Capital expenditures and capitalized interest 76,697
Escrow cash-capital improvements/acquisition deposits/deferred purchase price (95,873 )
Joint venture investments (304,793 )
Distributions from joint ventures 123,534
Proceeds from sales of real estate/partial interest in property (1,830,037 )
Debt and preferred equity and other investments (135,029 )
Increase in net cash used in investing activities $ (2,141,421 )

Funds spent on capital expenditures, which are comprised of building and tenant improvements, decreased from $412.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $335.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in capital expenditures relates primarily to lower costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment of properties.
We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, our credit facilities, our MRA facilities, senior unsecured notes, convertible or exchangeable securities, and construction loans. From time to time, the Company may issue common or preferred stock, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, we used cash for the following financing activities (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------- -------- ---------

Proceeds from our debt obligations $ 1,921,465
Repayments of our debt obligations 977,665
Net distribution to noncontrolling interests (4,706 )

2011 Outperformance Plan
In August 2011, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2011 Outperformance Plan, or the 2011 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2011 Outperformance Plan could earn, in the aggregate, up to $85.0 million of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2011. Under the 2011 Outperformance Plan, participants were entitled to share in a "performance pool" comprised of LTIP Units with a value equal to 10% of the amount by which our total return to stockholders during the three-year period exceeded a cumulative total return to stockholders of 25%, subject to the maximum of $85.0 million of LTIP Units; provided that if maximum performance was achieved, one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the second year and an additional one-third of each award could be earned at any time after the beginning of the third year. LTIP Units earned under the 2011 Outperformance Plan were subject to vesting requirements, with 50% of any awards earned vesting on August 31, 2014 and the remaining 50% vesting on August 31, 2015, based on continued employment with us through such dates. Participants were not entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2011 Outperformance Plan unless and until they were earned. For LTIP Units that were earned, each participant was also entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions are paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested. In June 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved during the third year of the performance period and, accordingly, 560,908 LTIP Units, representing two-thirds of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan. In September 2014, the compensation committee determined that maximum performance had been achieved for the full three-year performance period and, accordingly, 280,454 LTIP units, representing the final third of each award, were earned, subject to vesting, under the 2011 Outperformance Plan.
The cost of the 2011 Outperformance Plan ($26.7 million, subject to forfeitures) was amortized into earnings through the final vesting period. We recorded no compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2017,no compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, and $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the 2011 Outperformance Plan.
2014 Outperformance Plan
In August 2014, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors approved the general terms of the SL Green Realty Corp. 2014 Outperformance Plan, or the 2014 Outperformance Plan. Participants in the 2014 Outperformance Plan could earn, in the aggregate, up to 610,000 LTIP Units in our Operating Partnership based on our total return to stockholders for the three-year period beginning September 1, 2014. Under the 2014 Outperformance Plan, two-thirds of the LTIP Units were subject to performance based vesting based on the Company’s absolute total return to stockholders and one-third of the LTIP Units were subject to performance based vesting based on relative total return to stockholders compared to the constituents of the MSCI REIT Index. LTIP Units earned under the 2014 Outperformance Plan were to be subject to continued vesting requirements, with 50% of any awards earned vesting on August 31, 2017 and the remaining 50% vesting on August 31, 2018, subject to continued employment with us through such dates. Participants were not entitled to distributions with respect to LTIP Units granted under the 2014 Outperformance Plan unless and until they are earned. If LTIP Units were earned, each participant would have been entitled to the distributions that would have been paid had the number of earned LTIP Units been issued at the beginning of the performance period, with such distributions being paid in the form of cash or additional LTIP Units. Thereafter, distributions were paid currently with respect to all earned LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested.
Based on our performance, none of the LTIP Units granted under the 2014 Outperformance Plan were earned pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Outperformance Plan, and all units issued were forfeited in 2017.
The cost of the 2014 Outperformance Plan ($27.9 million subject to forfeitures), based on the portion of the 2014 Outperformance Plan granted prior to termination, was amortized into earnings through December 31, 2017. We recorded compensation expense of $13.6 million, $8.4 million, and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to the 2014 Outperformance Plan.
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors
Under our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to 100% of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of (i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of our common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director’s account as additional phantom stock units.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, 12,727 phantom stock units were earned and 9,509 shares of common stock were issued to our board of directors. We recorded compensation expense of $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2017, there were 99,853 phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2007, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to encourage our employees to increase their efforts to make our business more successful by providing equity-based incentives to eligible employees. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, and has been adopted by the board to enable our eligible employees to purchase the Company's shares of common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of 500,000 shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be three months in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of December 31, 2017, 104,597 shares of our common stock had been issued under the ESPP.
Market Capitalization
At December 31, 2017, borrowings under our mortgages and other loans payable, 2017 credit facility, senior unsecured notes, trust preferred securities and our share of joint venture debt represented 49.4% of our combined market capitalization of $20.4 billion (based on a common stock price of $100.93 per share, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2017). Market capitalization includes our consolidated debt, common and preferred stock and the conversion of all units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, and our share of joint venture debt.

Corporate Indebtedness
2017 Credit Facility
In November 2017, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility, referred to as the 2017 credit facility, that was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, or the 2012 credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the 2017 credit facility consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $1.3 billion term loan (or "Term Loan A"), and a $200.0 million term loan (or "Term Loan B") with maturity dates of March 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, and November 21, 2024, respectively. The revolving credit facility has two six-month as-of-right extension options to March 31, 2023. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity of the credit facility to $4.5 billion at any time prior to the maturity dates for the revolving credit facility and term loans without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions.
As of December 31, 2017, the 2017 credit facility bore interest at a spread over 30-day LIBOR ranging from (i) 82.5 basis points to 155 basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility, (ii) 90 basis points to 175 basis points for loans under Term Loan A, and (iii) 150 basis points to 245 basis points for loans under Term Loan B, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company.
At December 31, 2017, the applicable spread was 100 basis points for the revolving credit facility, 110 basis points for Term Loan A, and 165 basis points for Term Loan B. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a 12.5 to 30 basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the facility fee was 20 basis points.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $11.8 million of outstanding letters of credit, $40.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion outstanding under the term loan facilities, with total undrawn capacity of $1.4 billion under the 2017 credit facility. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of $30.3 million and $(6.3) million, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. The December 31, 2016 carrying value represents deferred financing costs and is presented within other liabilities. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the term loan facilities had a carrying value of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, net of deferred financing costs.
The Company and the Operating Partnership are borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2017 credit facility. ROP is a guarantor under the 2017 credit facility.
The 2017 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below).
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Facility
The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, a New York licensed captive insurance company, was a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. In January 2017, all funds borrowed from the FHLBNY were repaid and Belmont's membership was terminated in February 2017.
Master Repurchase Agreements
The Company has entered into two Master Repurchase Agreements, or MRAs, known as the 2016 MRA and 2017 MRA, which provide us with the ability to sell certain debt investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreement by managing the credit quality of our assets, early repayments, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value. The margin call provisions under our repurchase facilities permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity, and are not limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with our debt investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolio and is in contact with our borrowers in order to monitor the collateral and enforce our rights as necessary. The risk associated with potential margin calls is further mitigated by our ability to recollateralize the facility with additional assets from our portfolio of debt investments, our ability to satisfy margin calls with cash or cash equivalents and our access to additional liquidity through the 2017 credit facility, as defined above.
In June 2017, we entered into the 2017 MRA, with a maximum facility capacity of $300.0 million. The facility bears interest on a floating rate basis at a spread to 30-day LIBOR based on the pledged collateral and advance rate and has an initial one year

term, with two one year extension options. At December 31, 2017, the facility had a carrying value of $90.1 million, net of deferred financing costs.
In July 2016, we entered into a restated 2016 MRA, with a maximum facility capacity of $300.0 million. The facility bears interest ranging from 225 and 400 basis points over 30-day LIBOR depending on the pledged collateral and has an initial two-year term, with a one year extension option. Since December 6, 2015, we have been required to pay monthly in arrears a 25 basis point fee on the excess of $150.0 million over the average daily balance during the period when the average daily balance is less than $150.0 million. At December 31, 2017, the facility had a carrying value of $(1.2) million, representing deferred financing costs presented within other liabilities.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the gross book value of the properties and debt and preferred equity investments collateralizing the mortgages and other loans payable, not including assets held for sale, was approximately $4.8 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively.

The terms of the 2017 credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that, we will not during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures
In June 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership issued $100.0 million in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The securities mature in 2035 and bear interest at a floating rate of 125 basis points over the three-month LIBOR. Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to eight consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations are managed through either the use of interest rate derivative instruments and/or through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2017 would increase our consolidated annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt and preferred equity investments, by $2.7 million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by $17.2 million. At December 31, 2017, 61.5% of our $2.1 billion debt and preferred equity portfolio is indexed to LIBOR.
We recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.
Our long-term debt of $4.3 billion bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. Our variable rate debt and variable rate joint venture debt as of December 31, 2017 bore interest based on a spread of LIBOR plus 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 415 basis points.
Contractual Obligations
The combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other loans payable, the 2017 credit facility, senior unsecured notes (net of discount), trust preferred securities, our share of joint venture debt, including as-of-right extension options and put options, estimated interest expense, and our obligations under our capital lease and ground leases, as of December 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have off-balance sheet investments, including joint ventures and debt and preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. Substantially all of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments" and Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Capital Expenditures
We estimate that for the year ending December 31, 2018, we expect to incur $147.3 million of recurring capital expenditures and $108.8 million of development or redevelopment expenditures, net of loan reserves, (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on existing consolidated properties, and our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties, net of loan reserves, will be $502.7 million. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with operating cash flow, existing liquidity, or incremental borrowings. We expect our capital needs over the next twelve months and thereafter will be met through a combination of cash on hand, net cash provided by operations, potential asset sales, borrowings or additional equity or debt issuances.

Dividends/Distributions
We expect to pay dividends to our stockholders based on the distributions we receive from our Operating Partnership primarily from property revenues net of operating expenses or, if necessary, from working capital.
To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Based on our current annual dividend rate of $3.25 per share, we would pay $316.1 million in dividends to our common stockholders on an annual basis. Before we pay any dividend, whether for Federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under the 2017 credit facility and senior unsecured notes, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable.

Related Party Transactions
Cleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services
Alliance Building Services, or Alliance, and its affiliates are partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, the chairman of our board of directors, and provide services to certain properties owned by us. Alliance’s affiliates include First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, Classic Security LLC, Bright Star Couriers LLC and Onyx Restoration Works, and provide cleaning, extermination, security, messenger, and restoration services, respectively. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. The Service Corporation has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements.
Income earned from the profit participation, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was $3.9 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We also recorded expenses, inclusive of capitalized expenses, of $22.6 million, $23.4 million and $21.3 million the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for these services (excluding services provided directly to tenants).
Management Fees
S.L. Green Management Corp., a consolidated entity, receives property management fees from an entity in which Stephen L. Green owns an interest. We received management fees from this entity of $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively.
One Vanderbilt Investment
In December 2016, we entered into agreements with entities owned and controlled by Marc Holliday and Andrew Mathias, pursuant to which they agreed to make an investment in our One Vanderbilt project at the appraised fair market value for the interests acquired. This investment entitles these entities to receive approximately 1.50% - 1.80% and 1.00% - 1.20%, respectively, of any profits realized by the Company from its One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company’s capital contributions. The entities have no right to any return of capital. Accordingly, subject to previously disclosed repurchase rights, these interests will have no value and will not entitle these entities to any amounts (other than limited distributions to cover tax liabilities incurred) unless and until the Company has received distributions from the One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company’s aggregate investment in the project. In the event that the Company does not realize a profit on its investment in the project (or would not realize a profit based on the value at the time the interests are repurchased), the entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias will lose the entire amount of their investment. The entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias paid $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, which equal the fair market value of the interests acquired as of the date the investment agreements were entered into as determined by an independent third party appraisal that we obtained.
Messrs. Holliday and Mathias cannot monetize their interests until after stabilization of the property (50% within three years after stabilization and 100% three years or more after stabilization). In addition, the agreement calls for us to repurchase these interests in the event of a sale of One Vanderbilt or a transactional change of control of the Company. We also have the right to

62

Table of Contents

repurchase these interests on the seven-year anniversary of the stabilization of the project or upon the occurrence of certain separation events prior to the stabilization of the project relating to each of Messrs. Holliday’s and Mathias’s continued service with us. The price paid upon monetization of the interests will equal the liquidation value of the interests at the time, with the value of One Vanderbilt being based on its sale price, if applicable, or fair market value as determined by an independent third party appraiser.
Insurance
We maintain “all-risk” property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism ("NBCR")), within three property insurance programs and liability insurance. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as the development of One Vanderbilt. Additionally, our captive insurance company, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, provides coverage for NBCR terrorist acts above a specified trigger, although if Belmont is required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of Belmont's required payment. However, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. Further, if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. Additionally, our debt instruments contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance and we could default under debt our instruments if the cost and/or availability of certain types of insurance make it impractical or impossible to comply with such covenants relating to insurance. Belmont provides coverage solely on properties owned by the Company or its affiliates.
Furthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including properties held by joint ventures, or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss.

Funds from Operations
FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based bonuses for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.

Inflation
Substantially all of our office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations as well as operating expense recoveries based on increases in the Consumer Price Index or other measures such as porters' wage. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases will be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.

On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio.

The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of 500,000 shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be three months in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of December 31, 2017, 104,597 shares of our common stock had been issued under the ESPP.
Market Capitalization
At December 31, 2017, borrowings under our mortgages and other loans payable, 2017 credit facility, senior unsecured notes, trust preferred securities and our share of joint venture debt represented 49.4% of our combined market capitalization of $20.4 billion (based on a common stock price of $100.93 per share, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2017). Market capitalization includes our consolidated debt, common and preferred stock and the conversion of all units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, and our share of joint venture debt.
