ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.

The Utility’s base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast costs.  Differences between forecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials.  Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.  Generally, differences between actual costs and forecast costs affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations below).  However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension and other employee benefits, the Utility is authorized to track the difference between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).  The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for its customers.  Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).  See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1 for further discussion.

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  This combined MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wildfires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake, Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “Northern California wildfires”).  According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures.  Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44.

The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC, including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.  The Utility expects that Cal Fire will issue a report or reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the way that they progressed.  The CPUC’s SED is also conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted areas.  According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation management, and emergency preparedness and response.  It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings before its investigation is complete.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act.  Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities.

50

The Tax Act also required PG&E Corporation and the Utility to re-measure existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower federal tax rate.  During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation, on a consolidated basis, recorded a one-time provisional tax expense of $147 million to reflect the transitional impacts of the Tax Act.  Of this amount, $83 million is attributable to the re-measurement of PG&E Corporation’s net deferred tax asset comprised primarily of net operating loss carry-forwards and compensation-related items.  The remaining $64 million is related to the re-measurement of the Utility’s deferred taxes not reflected in authorized revenue requirements, such as disallowed plant.  The Utility also recorded a provisional $5.7 billion re-measurement of its deferred tax balances (related to flow-through and normalized timing differences for plant-related items) which was offset by a change from a net deferred income tax regulatory asset to a net regulatory liability.  The net deferred income tax regulatory liability will be refunded to customers over the regulatory lives of the related assets.  The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may materially vary from the above recorded amounts due to, among other things, future regulatory decisions from the CPUC that could differ from the Utility’s determination of how the impacts of the Tax Act are allocated between customers and shareholders.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Utility intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requirements and rate base in its 2017 GRC (for years 2018 and 2019) and 2015 GT&S rate case (for 2018) as well as a proposed implementation plan in connection thereto, and (ii) revised revenue requirement and rate base forecast in its 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision in connection with such filings.

On an aggregate basis, the Utility anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018, and incremental increases to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in 2019 as a result of the Tax Act.  The estimated benefit to customers is driven by the lower federal income tax rate applied to future earnings and the return of excess deferred income taxes.  These benefits are partially offset by earnings on higher rate base and lower tax benefits from flow-through items.

In addition to this reduction in future revenue requirements, the Tax Act is expected to accelerate when PG&E Corporation resumes paying federal taxes, primarily due to the elimination of bonus depreciation; although future taxes are expected to be lower due to the lower federal tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now expects to pay federal taxes starting in 2020, although that timing would be impacted by any significant changes to future results of operations.  Additionally, because the revenue reduction is expected to precede the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating cash flows will be negatively impacted resulting in additional financing needs.

Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share

The tables below include a summary reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s consolidated income available for common shareholders and EPS to earnings from operations and EPS based on earnings from operations for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and a summary reconciliation of the key drivers of PG&E Corporation’s earnings from operations and EPS based on earnings from operations for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  “Earnings from operations” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items impacting comparability.  “Items impacting comparability” represent items that management does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparability of financial results between periods.  PG&E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short and long-term operating plans, and employee incentive compensation.  PG&E Corporation believes that earnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance.  Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for GAAP measures such as income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(4)  The Utility incurred costs, net of insurance, of $15 million (before the tax impact of $6 million) and $60 million (before the tax impact of $24 million) during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, associated with the Butte fire.  This includes accrued charges of $350 million (before the tax impact of $143 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, related to estimated third-party claims.  The Utility also incurred charges of $15 million (before the tax impact of $6 million) and $60 million (before the tax impact of $25 million) during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, for legal costs.  These costs were partially offset by $350 million (before the tax impact of $143 million) recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, for expected insurance recoveries.

(5)  The Utility incurred costs of $12 million (before the tax impact of $5 million) and $89 million (before the tax impact of $37 million) during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, for pipeline related expenses incurred in connection with the multi-year effort to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights-of-way.

(6)  The Utility incurred costs of $2 million (before the tax impact of $1 million) and $10 million (before the tax impact of $4 million) during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, for legal and regulatory related expenses incurred in connection with various enforcement, regulatory, and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications.

(7)The Utility incurred costs of $71 million (before the tax impact of $24 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, for fines and penalties.  This includes costs of $32 million (before the tax impact of $13 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, associated with safety-related cost disallowances imposed by the CPUC in its April 9, 2015 San Bruno Penalty Decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigations.  The Utility also recorded $15 million (before the tax impact of $6 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, for penalty imposed by the CPUC in its final phase two decision of the 2015 GT&S rate case for prohibited ex parte communications.  In addition, the Utility recorded $24 million (before the tax impact of $5 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the PD in the OII into Compliance with Ex Parte Communication Rules.

(8)Consistent with the CPUC decision adopted on January 11, 2018 in connection with the retirement of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, the Utility recorded a disallowance of $47 million (before the tax impact of $15 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, comprised of cancelled projects of $24 million (before the tax impact of $6 million) and disallowed license renewal costs of $23 million (before the tax impact of $9 million).

(9)As a result of the CPUC’s final phase two decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Utility recorded revenues of $150 million (before the tax impact of $62 million) in excess of the 2017 authorized revenue requirement, which includes the final component of under-collected revenues retroactive to January 1, 2015.

(10) PG&E Corporation recorded proceeds from insurance, net of plaintiff payments, of $65 million (before the tax impact of $27 million) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, associated with the settlement agreement in connection with the shareholder derivative litigation that was approved by the court on July 18, 2017.  This includes $90 million (before the tax impact of $37 million) for insurance recoveries partially offset by $25 million (before the tax impact of $10 million) for plaintiff legal fees paid in connection with the settlement during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

 (11)  “Earnings from operations” is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Key Factors Affecting Financial Results

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the following factors:

The Impact of the Northern California Wildfires.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires.  The Utility incurred costs of $219 million for service restoration and repairs to the Utility’s facilities (including an estimated $97 million in capital expenditures) in connection with these fires.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover such costs through CEMA.  If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial.  In addition to such claims, as well as claims under other theories of liability, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  Further, the Utility also could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  If the Utility were to determine that it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recorded consistent with the principles discussed in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  To the extent not offset by insurance recoveries, the liability would affect the balance sheet equity of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The Applicability of the Doctrine of Inverse Condemnation in PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s Wildfire Litigation. The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential shareholder liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery even if a court decision imposes liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation.  In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard.  That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The Tax Cut and Jobs Act.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act.  Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminates bonus depreciation for utilities.  As a result of the Tax Act, beginning in 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility anticipate a reduction in revenues, lower effective income tax rates and lower income tax expense.  In addition, the Utility expects a rate base increase primarily due to the elimination of bonus depreciation.  (See “The Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017” and “Regulatory Matters” in this Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Outcome of Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters.  The Utility’s financial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including the impact of the Northern California wildfires, the Butte fire, the safety culture OII and any related fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools that could be imposed by the CPUC, including as a result of the phase two of the proceeding, the ex parte OII and the related proposed decision, the potential recommendations that the third-party monitor (retained by the Utility in the first quarter of 2017 as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal criminal conviction) may make, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking Proceedings.  The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its 2019 GT&S rate case, and FERC TO18 and TO19 rate cases, as well as the recent remand decision by the Ninth Circuit regarding an ROE adder for transmission facilities.  (See “Regulatory Matters – 2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters − FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases” below for more information.)  The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the Utility’s reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors.

The Ability of the Utility to Control and Recover Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures.  In any given year the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized rate of return depends on its ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized in rate case decisions.  The Utility forecasts that in 2018 it will incur unrecovered pipeline-related expenses ranging from $35 million to $60 million which primarily relate to costs to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Also, the CPUC decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case established various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the rate case cycle through 2018. (See “Disallowance of Plant Costs” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

55

The Amount and Timing of the Utility’s Financing Needs.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets, ability to borrow under its loan financing arrangements and the terms and rates of future financings could be materially affected by the outcome of, or market perception of, the matters discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including liabilities, if any, incurred in relation to the Northern California wildfires, adverse effects on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio covenants in their financing arrangements and regulatory capital structure requirements resulting therefrom, adverse changes in their respective credit ratings, general economic and market conditions, and other factors.  PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as needed to maintain the Utility’s CPUC-authorized capital structure.  In 2017, PG&E Corporation issued $416 million of common stock and made equity contributions of $455 million to the Utility.  PG&E Corporation forecasts that it will need to continue to issue a material amount of equity in future years, primarily to support the Utility’s capital expenditures.  PG&E Corporation may seek to issue additional equity to fund unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses and to pay claims, losses, fines, and penalties that may be required by the outcome of litigation and enforcement matters.  Additional issuances of equity, if any, could have a material dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS.

Changes in the Utility Industry.  The Utility is committed to delivering safe, reliable, sustainable, and affordable electric and gas services to its customers.  Increasing demands from state laws and policies relating to increased renewable energy resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the expansion of energy efficiency programs, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, and the development of energy storage technologies have increased pressure on the Utility to achieve efficiencies in its operations while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable service.  The utility industry is also undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.  California’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support California's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policy makers notwithstanding a recent change in the federal approach to such matters.  In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).  The Utility forecasts over $1 billion in grid investments through 2020, which would include increased remote control and sensor technology of the grid, integration investments in connection with DER bi-directional energy flows and voltage fluctuations, advanced grid data analytics, grid storage that enables renewable integration, expanded infrastructure for light, medium, and heavy-duty EVs, transmission integration for renewables, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.  In addition, these changes brought about by technological advancements and climate policy may cause a reduction in natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs.  The combination of reduced natural gas load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and potential cost recovery risk.

For more information about the factors and risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  In addition, this 2017 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management's knowledge of facts as of the date of this 2017 Form 10-K.  See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion presents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating results for 2017, 2016, and 2015.  See “Key Factors Affecting Financial Results” above for further discussion about factors that could affect future results of operations.

PG&E Corporation

The consolidated results of operations consist primarily of results related to the Utility, which are discussed in the “Utility” section below.  The following table provides a summary of net income available for common shareholders:

(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
------------------ ---- ----- ---- - ----- - ---
Consolidated Total $ 1,646 $ 1,393 $ 874
PG&E Corporation (31) 5 26
Utility $ 1,677 $ 1,388 $ 848

PG&E Corporation’s net income consists primarily of income taxes, interest expense on long-term debt, and other income from investments.  The decrease in PG&E Corporation’s net income for 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and interest expense, partially offset by the impact of the San Bruno Derivative Litigation.  Results include approximately $30 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment in SolarCity Corporation recognized in 2015, with no corresponding gains in 2016 or 2017.

Utility

The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2017, 2016, and 2015.  The table separately identifies the revenues and costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs, do not impact earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and the corresponding revenues the Utility is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs to own and operate its assets.

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings

The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2017, 2016, and 2015, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these periods.

Operating Revenues

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $144 million, or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher electric transmission revenues.

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $1.2 billion or 13% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of approximately $700 million of incremental revenues authorized in the 2015 GT&S rate case and approximately $425 million of additional base revenues as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO17 rate case.

58

Operating and Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $675 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016.  In 2017, the Utility incurred $455 million less in disallowed charges (the Utility recorded a $47 million disallowance related to the Diablo Canyon settlement in 2017 as compared to $502 million of disallowed capital charges related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision and 2015 GT&S rate case decision in 2016) and $447 million less in charges related to the Butte fire (the Utility recorded $410 million in charges in 2017 as compared to $857 million in 2016).  These decreases were partially offset by insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire decreasing by approximately $275 million (the Utility recorded $350 million in insurance recoveries in 2017 as compared to approximately $625 million in 2016).  (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $385 million, or 7%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $857 million in charges for third-party claims, Utility clean-up, repair, and legal costs related to the Butte fire, $219 million in permanently disallowed capital spending, $34 million in charges recorded in connection with the final CPUC decision related to the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping investigation, the federal criminal trial, and the atmospheric corrosion inspection self-report, $24 million in higher pipeline-related expenses and legal and regulatory related expenses during 2016, an escalation related to labor, benefits, and service contracts, and accelerated transmission and distribution project work.  These increases were partially offset by $500 million in charges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision for customer refunds and fines incurred in 2015 with no corresponding charges in 2016 and approximately $125 million in lower disallowed capital charges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision in 2016.  Additionally, the Utility recorded approximately $576 million more in insurance recoveries (in 2016, the Utility recorded $625 million in insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire as compared to $49 million of insurance recoveries for third-party claims related to the San Bruno accident in 2015).

The Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires and any additional charges associated with costs related to the Butte fire.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors above and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning

The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $100 million, or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016 and $143 million, or 5% in 2016 compared to 2015.  In 2017, the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in the 2017 GRC.  In 2016, the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions.

Interest Expense

The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $58 million, or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.  The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $56 million, or 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.

Interest Income and Other Income, Net

There were no material changes to interest income and other income, net for the periods presented.

Income Tax Provision

The Utility’s income tax provision increased $357 million in 2017 compared to 2016.  The increase in the tax provision was primarily the result of the statutory tax effect of higher pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016 and an adjustment required to record the change in deferred tax balances due to tax reform in 2017 with no comparable adjustment in 2016.   (For more information see “Tax Reform” below and Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Utility’s income tax provision increased $89 million in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increase in the tax provision was primarily the result of the statutory tax effect of higher pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by higher tax benefits from property-related timing differences in 2016 compared to 2015.  The higher effective tax rate was driven by higher pre-tax earnings in 2016, partially offset by rate impact from property-related timing differences.

59

The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision:

 2017 2016 2015
------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- ----- ---- ----- --
Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %
Increase (decrease) in income tax rate resulting from:
State income tax (net of federal benefit) (1) 1.6 (2.2 ) (4.8 )
Effect of regulatory treatment of fixed asset differences (2) (16.8 ) (23.4 ) (33.7 )
Tax credits (1.1 ) (0.8 ) (1.3 )
Benefit of loss carryback - (1.1 ) (1.5 )
Non-deductible penalties (3) 0.4 0.8 4.3
Tax Reform Adjustment (4) 3.0 - -
Other, net (5) (2.0 ) (3.5 ) (0.2 )
Effective tax rate 20.1 % 4.8 % (2.2 )%

(1) Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment.  In 2016 and 2015, amounts reflect an agreement with the IRS on a 2011 audit related to electric transmission and distribution repairs deductions.  The 2017 amount reflects an agreement with the IRS on a 2013 audit related to generation repairs deductions.

(2) Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs as authorized by the 2014 GRC decision in all periods presented and by the 2015 GT&S decision which impacted 2016 and 2017.  All amounts are impacted by the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.

(3) Primarily represents the effects of a non-tax deductible penalty associated with the Butte fire for 2017, non-tax deductible fines and penalties associated with the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping decision for 2016 and the effects of the San Bruno Penalty Decision for 2015.

(4) Represents the required adjustment to deferred tax balances, due to the federal income tax rate being lowered from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act.

(5) These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settlements.

Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs (see below for more detail).

Cost of Electricity

The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its own generation facilities, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity.

(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
---------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- - ------ - ------
Cost of purchased power $ 4,039 $ 4,510 $ 4,805
Fuel used in own generation facilities 270 255 294
Total cost of electricity $ 4,309 $ 4,765 $ 5,099
Average cost of purchased power per kWh (1) $ 0.140 $ 0.109 $ 0.100
Total purchased power (in millions of kWh) (2) 28,750 41,324 48,175

(1) Average cost of purchased power was impacted primarily by lower Utility electric customer demand due to their departure to CCAs or direct access providers and a larger percentage of higher cost renewable energy resources being allocated to fewer remaining Utility electric customers.  See further discussion in Item 7. MD&A, “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives - Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR”, below.

(2) The decrease in purchased power for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower Utility electric customer demand and an increase in generation from hydroelectric facilities.

60

Cost of Natural Gas

The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s cost of natural gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer demand.

(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
----------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- - ----
Cost of natural gas sold $ 627 $ 481 $ 518
Transportation cost of natural gas sold 119 134 145
Total cost of natural gas $ 746 $ 615 $ 663
Average cost per Mcf (1) of natural gas sold $ 2.97 $ 2.45 $ 2.74
Total natural gas sold (in millions of Mcf) (2) 211 196 189

(1) One thousand cubic feet

(2) The increase in natural gas sold for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to cooler temperatures and resulted in additional customer heating demand.

Operating and Maintenance Expenses

The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributions and public purpose programs costs.  If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 2017, 2016, and 2015, no material amounts were incurred above authorized amounts.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Overview

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, due to the uncertainty related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets.  The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital.  The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term senior unsecured debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock.  (See “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.

PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility, and declare and pay dividends primarily depends on the level of cash distributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.  PG&E Corporation’s equity contributions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.  PG&E Corporation has material stand-alone cash flows related to the issuance of equity and long-term debt, and issuances and repayments under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  PG&E Corporation relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.

61

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters, including the outcome of the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  Credit rating downgrades may increase the cost and availability of short-term borrowing, including commercial paper, the costs associated with credit facilities, and long-term debt costs.  In addition, some of the Utility’s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.   In December 2017, following PG&E Corporation’s announcement that it was suspending its dividend due to the uncertainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires, all of the ratings of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were placed under review for downgrade by Moody’s Investor Services.  Additionally, in December 2017, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings lowered the Utility’s preferred stock credit rating and placed all of the ratings of PG&E Corporation and the Utility on CreditWatch with negative implications.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability positions.  (See Notes 9 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s equity needs could increase materially and its liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by potential costs and other liabilities in connection with the Northern California wildfires.  The Utility’s equity needs will also continue to be affected by the timing and amount of disallowed capital expenditures, and by fines, penalties and claims that may be imposed in connection with the matters described in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  In addition, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets in a manner consistent with its past practices, if at all, could be adversely affected by such matters.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

As a result of the Tax Act, the Utility anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018.  In addition to this reduction in future revenue requirements, the Tax Act’s other provisions, in particular the elimination of bonus depreciation, are expected to accelerate when PG&E Corporation resumes paying federal taxes; although future taxes will be lower due to the lower federal tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now expects to pay federal taxes starting in 2020, although that timing would be impacted by any significant changes to future results of operations.  Additionally, because the revenue reduction is expected to precede the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating cash flows will be negatively impacted resulting in additional financing needs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.

Financial Resources

Debt Financings

In February 2017, the Utility’s $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in March 2016, matured and was repaid.  Additionally, in February 2017, the Utility entered into a $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan maturing on February 22, 2018.

In March 2017, the Utility issued $400 million principal amount of 3.30% senior notes due March 15, 2027 and $200 million principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due December 1, 2046.  The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the Utility’s outstanding commercial paper.

In November 2017, the Utility issued $1,150 million principal amount of 3.30% senior notes due December 1, 2027 and $850 million principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due December 1, 2047.  The proceeds were used to repay all of the $700 million outstanding principal amount of its 5.63% senior notes due November 30, 2017, all of the $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan maturing February 22, 2018 and $400 million of the 8.25% senior notes due October 15, 2018, and the balance, for general corporate purposes.

62

In November 2017, the Utility issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due November 28, 2018.  The proceeds were used towards repayment of the $250 million unsecured floating rate notes due November 30, 2017 and the balance was used to support the Northern California wildfire response efforts.

On January 9, 2018, the Utility sent a notice of redemption to redeem all $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% senior notes due October 15, 2018 on February 18, 2018.  On January 31, 2018, the Utility deposited with the trustee funds sufficient to effect the early redemption of these bonds and satisfy and discharge its remaining obligation of $400 million.

Equity Financings

In February 2017, PG&E Corporation amended its February 2015 EDA providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregate gross price of up to $275 million.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation sold 0.4 million shares of its common stock under the February 2017 EDA for cash proceeds of $28.4 million, net of commissions paid of $0.2 million. There were no issuances under the February 2017 EDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the remaining gross sales available under this agreement were $246.3 million.

PG&E Corporation also issued common stock under the PG&E Corporation 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and share-based compensation plans.  During 2017, 7.4 million shares were issued for cash proceeds of $366.4 million under these plans.

The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes, including the contribution of equity to the Utility.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation made equity contributions to the Utility of $455 million.

Pollution Control Bonds

In June 2017, the Utility repurchased and retired $345 million principal amount of pollution control bonds Series 2004 A through D.  Additionally, in June 2017, the Utility remarketed three series of pollution control bonds, previously held in treasury, totaling $145 million in principal amount.  Series 2008 F and 2010 E bear interest at 1.75% per annum.  Although the stated maturity date for Series 2008 F and 2010 E is November 1, 2026, these bonds have a mandatory redemption date of May 30, 2022.  Series 2008 G bears interest at 1.05% per annum and matures on December 1, 2018.

Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs

In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 to April 27, 2022.  At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $168 million and $2.9 billion available under their respective $300 million and $3.0 billion revolving credit facilities.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

PG&E Corporation and the Utility can issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had an average outstanding commercial paper balance of $81 million and $469 million, and a maximum outstanding balance of $161 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had outstanding commercial paper balances of $132 million and $50 million, respectively.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization was 50% and 49%, respectively.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the common stock and at least 70% of the voting capital stock of the Utility.  In addition, the revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions regarding events of default and covenants including covenants limiting liens to those permitted under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s senior note indentures, mergers, and imposing conditions on the sale of all or substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s assets and other fundamental changes.  At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility were in compliance with all covenants under their respective revolving credit facilities.

63

Dividends

The Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each has the authority to declare dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock and the Utility’s common and preferred stock, respectively.  Dividends are not payable unless and until declared by the applicable Board of Directors.  Each Board of Directors retains authority to change the respective common or preferred stock dividend policy and dividend payout ratio or rate at any time, especially if unexpected events occur that would change their view as to the prudent level of cash conservation.

PG&E Corporation

For the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.49 per share. In May 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation approved a new annual common stock dividend of $2.12 per share.  As a result, for the second and third quarters of 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 per share.  In 2017, total dividends declared were $1.55 per share.  For the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.455 per share.  For each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.49 per share.  In 2016, total dividends declared were $1.925 per share.  For each of the quarters in 2015, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.455 per share, for annual dividends of $1.82 per share.  Dividends paid to common shareholders by PG&E Corporation were $1.0 billion in 2017, $921 million in 2016, and $856 million in 2015.

Utility

For the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $244 million to PG&E Corporation.  For the second and third quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $270 million to PG&E Corporation.  In 2017, total dividends paid by the Utility to PG&E Corporation were $784 million.  For the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $179 million to PG&E Corporation.  For each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $244 million to PG&E Corporation.  In 2016, total dividends paid by the Utility to PG&E Corporation were $911 million.  For each of the quarters in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $179 million to PG&E Corporation for annual dividends paid of $716 million.  In addition, the Utility paid $14 million of dividends on preferred stock in each of 2017, 2016, and 2015.  The Utility’s preferred stock is cumulative and any dividends in arrears must be paid before the Utility may pay any common stock dividends.

Utility Cash Flows

The Utility’s cash flows were as follows:

 Year Ended December 31,
----------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- - ------- - -------
(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,916 $ 4,344 $ 3,747
Net cash used in investing activities (5,650) (5,526) (5,211)
Net cash provided by financing activities 110 1,194 1,468
Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 376 $ 12 $ 4

Operating Activities

The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.6 billion compared to 2016.  This increase was primarily due to additional electric and natural gas operating revenues collected as authorized by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate case, the $400 million refund to natural gas customers in the second quarter of 2016, as required by the San Bruno Penalty Decision (with no corresponding activity in 2017), and the receipt of approximately $300 million of insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire in 2017 as compared to $50 million of insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire during 2016.

64

During 2016, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $597 million compared to 2015.  This increase was partially due to the Utility receiving an additional $170 million in tax refunds in 2016 as compared to 2015.  The remaining increase was primarily due to fluctuations in activities within the normal course of business such as timing and amount of customer billings and vendor billings and payments.

Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:

the timing and amount of costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires, as well as potential liabilities in connection with third-party claims and fines or penalties that could be imposed on the Utility if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations;

the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with the current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including the impact of the Butte fire and the timing and amount of related insurance recoveries, the safety culture OII, including other ratemaking tools that could be imposed by the CPUC as a result of the phase two of the proceeding, the ex parte OII and the related proposed decision, costs associated with potential recommendations that the third-party monitor may make related to the Utility’s conviction in the federal criminal trial, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports;

the Tax Act, which is expected to accelerate the timing of federal tax payments and reduce revenue requirements, resulting in lower operating cash flows;

the timing and outcomes of the 2019 GT&S, TO18, and TO19 rate cases and other ratemaking and regulatory proceedings;

the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does not recover, associated with its electric and natural gas systems; and

the timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to pay.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures.  Net cash used in investing activities increased by $315 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase of approximately $440 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in restricted cash released from escrow by approximately $160 million.

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur approximately $6.3 billion in capital expenditures in 2018 and $6.0 billion in 2019.

Financing Activities

During 2017, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $1.1 billion as compared to 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to net commercial repayments of $972 million in 2017 as compared to net repayments of $9 million in 2016.  During 2016, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $274 million as compared to 2015.  Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issuances and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure, and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

The following table provides information about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s contractual commitments at December 31, 2017:

(1) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt.  Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2017 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument’s maturity.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

(2) See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

(3) See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements.  As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the amount shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension and other benefit plans.

(4) Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock were suspended.  While the timing of cumulative dividend payments is uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.  (See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The contractual commitments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits, PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot make reliable estimates of the amounts and periods of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognized tax benefits.  Matters relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, other than those discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (the Utility’s commodity purchase agreements) in Item 8.

ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION MATTERS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation matters described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Legal Proceedings in Item 3.  The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

66

REGULATORY MATTERS

The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies.  The resolutions of these and other proceedings may affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The Utility is still analyzing the impact of the Tax Act on revenue requirements and rate base for the 2017 GRC, the 2015 GT&S Rate Case, the recently submitted 2019 GT&S Rate Case, and the pending TO19 rate case.  However, on an aggregate basis, the Utility currently anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018, and incremental increases to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in 2019, as a result of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Utility intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requirements and rate base in its 2017 GRC (for years 2018 and 2019) and 2015 GT&S rate case (for 2018) as well as a proposed implementation plan in connection thereto, and (ii) revised revenue requirement and rate base forecast in its 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision in connection with such filings.  As discussed below, the 2017 GRC final decision established a tax memorandum account to track revenue differences resulting from tax law changes, among other items, for disposition in the 2020 GRC.  The March filings will accelerate that timing.  (See “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2017 General Rate Case

On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”) that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return.  The final decision approved, with certain modifications, the settlement agreement that the Utility, the ORA, TURN, and 12 other intervening parties jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016 (the “settlement agreement”).  Modifications from the settlement agreement to the final decision included a tax memorandum account and approval of a stand-alone application with the CPUC or a filing in the CPUC’s ongoing residential rate reform proceeding to recover customer outreach and other costs incurred as a result of residential rate reform implementation.  The new tax memorandum account will track any revenue differences resulting from changes in income tax expense caused by net revenue changes, mandatory or elective tax law changes, tax accounting changes, tax procedural changes, or tax policy changes during the 2017 through 2019 GRC period.  The account will remain open and the balance in the account will be reviewed in every subsequent GRC proceeding until a CPUC decision closes the account.

67

The final decision approved a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of $444 million in 2018 and $361 million in 2019, in line with the amounts proposed in the settlement agreement.  The following table shows the revenue requirement amounts approved in the final decision based on line of business and cost category as well as the differences between the 2016 authorized revenue requirements and the amounts approved in the final decision:

Total revenue requirements $ 8,004 $ 88

(1) Amounts approved in the final decision are the same as the amounts that were proposed in the settlement agreement.

As required by the final decision, the Utility has submitted a variety of compliance filings, including filings on June 12, 2017, which provides accounting for the January 2017 $300 million expense reduction announcement and on July 10, 2017, providing an update of the cost effectiveness study for the SmartMeter™ Upgrade project.  On February 8, 2018, the CPUC extended the statutory deadline for the 2017 GRC from February 8, 2018 to August 9, 2018, in order to allow for comments and CPUC action on any PD on the SmartMeterTM Upgrade cost effectiveness study, as well as one other remaining GRC compliance item.

2020 General Rate Case

The Utility expects to file the 2020 GRC by September 1, 2018. On November 30, 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal to the CPUC in advance of its 2020 GRC filing.  The RAMP is a new CPUC requirement directing each large energy utility to submit a report describing how it assesses its risks and how it plans to mitigate and minimize such risks in advance of the utility’s GRC application.  The objective of this filing is to inform the CPUC of the Utility’s top safety-related risks, risk assessment procedures, and proposed mitigations of those risks for 2020-2022.

The SED is expected to submit a report on the Utility’s RAMP submittal and hold a workshop on the report, after which parties will have the opportunity to file comments.  The RAMP results will be incorporated in the Utility’s 2020 GRC.

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case

During 2016, the CPUC issued final decisions in phase one and phase two of the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision adopted the revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016, to recover its costs of gas transmission and storage services for the 2015 GT&S rate case period (2015 through 2018).  The phase two decision determined the allocation of the $850 million penalty assessed in the San Bruno Penalty Decision and the revenue requirement reduction for the five-month delay caused by the Utility’s violation of the CPUC ex parte communication rules in this proceeding.

68

The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding.  A draft of the audit report is expected in the first quarter of 2018.  The decision established new one-way balancing accounts to track costs as well as various cost caps that will increase the risk of disallowance over the current rate case cycle.  The Utility would be required to take a charge in the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance.

In August 2016 and January 2017, TURN, ORA and Indicated Shippers filed applications for rehearing of the phase one and phase two decisions, respectively.  The Utility cannot predict when or if the CPUC will grant the rehearings or if it will adopt the parties’ recommendations.  Additionally, in June 2017, the Utility filed a PFM of the phase one decision to eliminate the requirement that the Utility install new cathodic protection systems in 2018 because the Utility is not in a position to identify the optimal location for such new systems in 2018.  Instead, the Utility requested to be allowed to continue its current cathodic protection program.  As directed by the CPUC, on August 23, 2017, the Utility provided supplemental information to the CPUC regarding the PFM.  The Utility is unable to predict if and when the CPUC would adopt the PFM.  In the event the PFM is not adopted and the Utility fails to perform the mandated new cathodic protection systems, the Utility could incur fines and penalties, the amount of which the Utility is unable to predict.

2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case

On November 17, 2017, the Utility filed its 2019 GT&S rate case application with the CPUC, covering the years 2019 through 2021.  While the Utility has not formally proposed a fourth year for this rate case, it provided a revenue requirement and rates for 2022, in the event the CPUC adopts an additional year.

In its application, the Utility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.59 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing natural gas transmission and storage services beginning on January 1, 2019.  This corresponds to an increase of $289 million over the Utility’s 2018 authorized revenue requirement of $1.30 billion.  The Utility’s request also includes proposed revenue requirements of $1.73 billion for 2020, $1.91 billion for 2021, and $1.91 billion for 2022 if the CPUC orders a fourth year for the rate case period.

The requested rate base for 2019 is $4.66 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $0.95 billion over the 2018 authorized rate base of $3.71 billion.  These rate base amounts exclude approximately $576 million of capital spending subject to audit by the CPUC related to 2011 through 2014 expenditures in excess of amounts adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case.  The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million, or a portion thereof, will ultimately be authorized by the CPUC and included in the Utility’s future rate base.  The Utility’s request also excludes rate base adjustments that the Utility requested with the CPUC on November 14, 2017, resulting from the IRS’s October 5, 2017 private letter ruling issued in connection with the CPUC’s final phase two decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case.  The Utility’s request is based on capital expenditure forecasts of $971 million for 2019, $963 million for 2020, and $804 million for 2021 (which exclude common capital allocations).

The increase in revenue requirement is largely attributable to increased infrastructure investment and costs related to new natural gas storage safety and environmental regulations.  Such new regulations were issued by: (1) the DOGGR, which issued six new safety and reliability natural gas storage measures in 2016 in response to the 2015 Southern California natural gas storage leak in Aliso Canyon; (2) the PHMSA, which issued interim final rules, effective January 18, 2017, that address pipeline safety issues and mandate certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities; and (3) the CPUC, which issued General Order 112-F that became effective on January 1, 2017, and requires additional expenditures in the areas of gas leak repair, leak survey, and high consequence area identification, among other things.

In addition, DOGGR is planning to complete its final rulemaking on new gas storage safety rules.  The draft rules, that were released for comments on May 19, 2017, include a requirement for natural gas storage operators to perform well integrity assessments every two years and to eliminate possible single points of failure from natural gas storage wells.  The implementation timeframe and requirements under the PHMSA’s proposed regulations currently are being challenged in federal courts.  In its application, the Utility proposes a new two-way Gas Storage Balancing Account to address uncertainty around the anticipated DOGGR regulations, and also proposes a new memorandum account to track costs related to other anticipated new regulations.

69

As a result of the existing and anticipated gas storage safety requirements, the Utility developed and proposed in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gas storage strategy which includes the discontinuation (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.  The discontinuation is expected to reduce long-term costs for customers and to reduce safety and environmental risks.

In addition to costs related to new natural gas storage safety and environmental regulations, the Utility proposed increased infrastructure investments over the 2019 to 2021 period to continue its efforts to improve overall system safety by: (1) making approximately 1,100 miles of transmission pipelines capable of in-line inspection; (2) performing in-line inspections of over 2,100 miles of transmission pipeline, or approximately one-third of total miles; (3) testing or replacing all pipeline without a test record (or with a test record that does not meet the Utility’s documentation requirements) by 2027; (4) replacing vintage pipeline for other safety or reliability issues; and (5) automating valves in areas where there is a significant potential impact.

A prehearing conference took place on January 4, 2018, and established a procedural schedule.  Testimony will be served near the end of second quarter of 2018 and evidentiary hearings, if needed, will begin in the third quarter of 2018. As stated above, the Utility expects to file an update of its revenue requirement forecast to reflect the Tax Act by the end of March 2018.

Transmission Owner Rate Cases

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18 rate case”)

On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a $387 million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 is $6.7 billion.  The Utility is also seeking a return on equity of 10.9%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the Utility forecasted that it will make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.

On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and set it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyance for settlement procedures.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  On March 17, 2017, the FERC chief judge issued an order terminating the settlement procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.

On August 22, 2017, the FERC trial staff submitted testimony.  The table below summarizes the differences between the amount of revenue requirement increases included in the Utility’s request and the testimony submitted by the FERC trial staff:

 Amounts Amounts
--------------------------- ------------ ----- - ---------------- - ----- -
 requested by proposed by the
(in millions) the Utility FERC trial staff
Revenue Requirement $ 1,718 $ 1,353
Return on Equity 10.90 % 8.46 %
Composite Depreciation Rate 3.26 % 2.08 %

Additionally, intervenors provided testimony on July 5, 2017 and the Utility submitted rebuttal testimony on October 9, 2017.  Hearings in this proceeding took place January 9 through January 30, 2018, and an initial decision is expected on or before June 1, 2018.

Also, on March 31, 2017, several of the parties that had already intervened in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC, and requested that the complaint be consolidated with the rate case.  The complaint asserts that the Utility’s revenue requirement request in TO18 is unreasonably high and should be reduced.  The complaint asks that, if the outcome of the litigation in TO18 is that the Utility’s revenue requirement should be set at a lower level than the revenue requirement from the TO17 settlement, that the FERC order refunds to that lower level determined in TO18 litigation.  On April 20, 2017, the Utility answered the complaint, requesting that FERC dismiss it. On November 16, 2017, FERC dismissed the complaint as the Utility had requested.  On December 18, 2017, the complainants filed a request for rehearing of that order, and on January 16, 2018, FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration.  That order does not address the merits of the complaint; it simply gives FERC more time to reconsider its prior order dismissing the complaint.  The Utility is unable to predict when FERC may issue an order on the merits of the complaint.

70

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19 rate case”)

On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.79 billion, a $74 million increase over the proposed 2017 revenue requirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 is $6.9 billion.  The Utility is also seeking an ROE of 10.75%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the Utility forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2017 filing, subject to hearing and refund, and established March 1, 2018, as the effective date for rate changes.  The next settlement conference is scheduled for May 16, 2018.  FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussion among the parties.

On September 29, 2017, several of the parties that have intervened in the TO19 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC, and requested that the complaint be consolidated with the TO19 rate case.  The complaint asserts that the Utility’s revenue requirement request in TO19 is unreasonably high and should be reduced.  The complaint asks that, if the outcome of the litigation in TO19 is that the Utility’s revenue requirement should be set at a lower level than the settled revenue requirement approved by FERC in TO17, FERC order refunds to that lower level determined in the TO18 litigation. On October 17, 2017, the Utility answered the complaint, requesting that FERC dismiss it.  The Utility is unable to predict when and how the FERC will respond to the complaint.

Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases)

On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases to grant the Utility a 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for continued participation in the CAISO.  The decision has been remanded to FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Court of Appeals’ opinion.  If FERC makes findings consistent with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ opinion, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively.  Alternatively, if FERC again concludes that the Utility should receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder and provides the additional explanation that the Ninth Circuit found the FERC’s prior decisions lacked, then the Utility would not owe any refunds for this issue for TO16 or TO17.  The Utility is unable to predict the outcome and timing of FERC’s response to this opinion.

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant

Joint Proposal for Plant Retirement

On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an application to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 and replace it with a portfolio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources.  The application implements a joint proposal between the Utility and the Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility Employees, and Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility (together, the “Joint Parties”).

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s proposal to retire Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025.  The CPUC also:

deferred consideration of replacement resources to the CPUC’s Integrated Resource Planning proceeding;

authorized rate recovery for up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retention program;

authorized rate recovery for an employee retraining program of $11.3 million requested by the Utility;

rejected rate recovery of the proposed $85 million for the community impacts mitigation program on the ground that rate recovery for such a program requires legislative authorization;

authorized rate recovery of $18.6 million of the total Diablo Canyon license renewal cost of $53 million and rate recovery of cancelled project costs equal to 100% of direct costs incurred prior to June 30, 2016, and 25% of direct costs incurred after June 30, 2016, based on a settlement agreement among the Utility, the Joint Parties, and certain other parties that the Utility filed with the CPUC in May 2017; and

approved the amortization of the book value for Diablo Canyon consistent with the Diablo Canyon closure schedule.

71

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Utility incurred pre-tax charges of $47 million related to the retirement of Diablo Canyon including $24 million for cancelled projects and $23 million for disallowed license renewal costs.  The Utility does not expect to incur additional charges as a result of the CPUC’s final decision, other than additional project cancellation costs that the Utility does not expect to be material.

The Joint Parties determined that they will not seek a rehearing on the CPUC final decision.  In accepting the CPUC's decision to retire Diablo Canyon, the Utility will withdraw its license renewal application at the NRC.

California State Lands Commission Lands Lease

On June 28, 2016, the California State Lands Commission approved a new lands lease for the intake and discharge structures at Diablo Canyon to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon’s current operating licenses, until Diablo Canyon Unit 2 ceases operations in August 2025.  The Utility believes that the approval of the new lease will ensure sufficient time for the Utility to identify and bring online a portfolio of GHG-free replacement resources.  The Utility will submit a future lease extension request to address the period of time required for plant decommissioning, which under NRC regulations can take as long as 60 years.  On August 28, 2016, the World Business Academy filed a writ in the Los Angeles Superior Court asserting that the State Lands Commission committed legal error when it determined that the short term lease extension for an existing facility was exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act and alleging that the State Lands Commission should be required to perform an environmental review of the new lands lease.  The trial took place on July 11, 2017, in Los Angeles Superior Court and the judge dismissed the petition on all grounds, ruling that the State Lands Commission properly determined the short term lease extension was subject to the existing facilities exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act. The World Business Academy appealed this decision and the matter is currently before the California Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, Second District.  The trial date has not been set.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Utility expects that the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses.  Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP.  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.

While the NDCTP forecast includes employee severance program estimates, it does not include estimated costs related to the final decision’s employee retention and retraining and development programs, and the San Luis Obispo County community mitigation program described above.  The Utility intends to conduct a site-specific decommissioning study to update the 2015 NDCTP forecast and to submit the study to the CPUC by mid-2019.

The Utility expects to file its 2018 NDCTP application in late 2018 or early 2019.  (See “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

CPUC Cost of Capital

On July 13, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting, with no modifications to it, the PFM filed in February 2017 by San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Southern California Gas Company, Southern California Edison, the ORA, TURN, and the Utility.

The final decision extends the Utility’s next cost of capital application filing deadline by two years to April 22, 2019, for the year 2020.  The final decision also reduces the Utility’s authorized ROE from 10.40% to 10.25%, effective January 1, 2018, and resets the Utility’s authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred stock effective January 1, 2018.  In addition, the decision suspends the cost of capital adjustment mechanism to adjust cost of capital for 2018, but allows the adjustment mechanism to operate for 2019 if triggered.  If the mechanism is activated for 2019, the Utility’s cost of capital, including its new ROE of 10.25%, will be adjusted according to the existing terms of the mechanism.  The Utility’s current capital structure of 52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred equity remains unchanged.

The final decision also leaves the proceeding open to facilitate gathering of information to inform the next cost of capital proceeding, as well as to provide a possible venue in which to consider whether the Utility’s ROE should be reduced until any recommendations that the CPUC may adopt in the second phase of its safety culture investigation are implemented, as described in the May 8, 2017 scoping memo and ruling issued in the Safety Culture OII.

72

On September 29, 2017, the Utility submitted an advice letter to the CPUC, updating its cost of capital and the estimated revenue requirement impacts with an effective date of January 1, 2018.  The long-term debt cost, reset to 4.89%, reflects actual embedded costs as of the end of August 2017 and forecasted interest rates for the new long-term debt expected to be issued for the remainder of 2017 and all of 2018.  Changes in market interest rates may have material effects on the cost of the Utility’s future financings, but will not affect the authorized cost of capital in 2018.

The Utility expects to file its next cost of capital application in 2019.

Application to Establish a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account

On July 26, 2017, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for the Utility to request recovery of wildfire costs in excess of insurance at a future date.  Concurrently with this application, the Utility also submitted a motion to the CPUC requesting that the WEMA be deemed effective as of July 26, 2017, such that the Utility may begin recording costs to the account while the application is pending before the CPUC.

Under the WEMA as proposed, the Utility would record costs related to wildfires, including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles, co-insurance and other insurance expense paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been authorized in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside legal costs incurred in the defense of wildfire claims; (3) premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts. Insurance proceeds, as well as any payments received from third parties, would be credited to the WEMA as they are received.  The WEMA would not include the Utility’s costs for fire response and infrastructure costs which are tracked in CEMA.  The Utility would be required to file an application to seek approval to recover costs tracked in WEMA.  A prehearing conference was held on December 8, 2017, and a scoping memo was issued on January 11, 2018.  The Utility filed opening briefs with the CPUC on January 25, 2018 and other parties’ briefs are expected to be filed in February 2018.  The Utility cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Applications

The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events through a CEMA.  The CEMA tariff authorizes the utilities to recover costs incurred in connection with a catastrophic event that has been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. In 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetation management work in response to the severe drought in California.  The costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA.  While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA applications are subject to CPUC approval.

In 2016, the Utility submitted a request to the CPUC to authorize recovery under the CEMA tariff revenue requirement of approximately $146 million for recorded capital and expense costs related to drought mitigation and emergency response activities for declared disasters that occurred from December 2012 through March 2016.  On January 4, 2018, ORA, TURN, and the Utility filed an all-party motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement these parties have entered into.  The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility’s total CEMA tariff revenue requirement request be reduced by $29 million, from $146 million to $117 million.  The Utility has requested that these costs be recovered through rates in 2018 and 2019.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

The Utility expects to submit its 2018 CEMA application to the CPUC in the second quarter of 2018.

Other Regulatory Proceedings and Initiatives

Electric Distribution Resources Plan

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s plan identifies optimal locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to be integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service.

73

On February 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a ruling that seeks the development of a process for incorporating DER forecasts into the DRP that takes into consideration the coordination with other statewide planning and forecasting processes such as the CEC’s Integrated Energy Policy Report.  This ruling mandated the Utility, along with the other California IOUs, to develop a draft joint proposal for the CPUC and stakeholder consideration on the process for developing DER forecasts.  On June 9, 2017, the IOUs submitted a draft joint proposal for CPUC and stakeholder consideration. The CPUC issued a PD on December 8, 2017, requiring the IOUs to use the CEC’s DER forecast for the 2018-2019 distribution planning cycle.  The Utility has historically used the CEC forecast for planning and will have the opportunity to adjust forecasts for EV, photovoltaic, and energy storage during the intermediate years.  The PD also requires the IOUs to develop an alternate planning forecast scenario in 2018 to establish a method for calculating costs and benefits for DER grid integration to better inform DER sourcing policies.  Workshops to discuss the joint proposal will continue in early 2018 and a final decision is expected from the CPUC by the end of the first quarter of 2018.

On June 30, 2017, the CPUC issued another ruling soliciting stakeholder responses on questions set forth in a CPUC staff white paper on proposing a DIDF.  The DIDF aims to establish a process for identifying distribution deferral opportunities for DERs.  Stakeholder comments on DIDF were submitted on August 7, 2017, with reply comments submitted on August 18, 2017. On December 8, 2017, the CPUC issued a PD requiring an annual grid needs assessment and an annual distribution deferral opportunity report, as part of the annual DRP for greater transparency on infrastructure investments. The grid needs assessment report will identify critical overload areas on the grid.  The distribution deferral opportunity report will document the Utility’s proposed distribution needs and identify DER deferral opportunities to be reviewed by the Distribution Planning Advisory Group for prioritizing DER deferral projects.  The PD proposes to adopt the regulatory incentive mechanism being piloted in the Integrated Distributed Energy Resources Proceeding where the Utility can earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on the annual payments for DER deferral contracts.  The Utility expects a final decision from the CPUC in the first quarter of 2018.

Integrated Distributed Energy Resources Proceeding – Regulatory Incentives Pilot Program

On April 4, 2016, the CPUC issued a ruling proposing to establish, on a pilot basis, an interim program offering regulatory incentives to the Utility and the other two large California IOUs for the deployment of cost-effective DERs.  The ruling stated that it did not intend for this phase to adopt a new regulatory framework or business model for the California electric utilities.  On December 22, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision in the proceeding which authorizes a pilot to test a regulatory incentive mechanism through which the Utility will earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on annual payments for DERs, as well as test a regulatory process that will allow the Utility to competitively solicit DER services to defer distribution infrastructure.  Each IOU is required to conduct at least one pilot, but may conduct up to three additional pilots.

In June 2017, the Utility submitted a pilot project proposal to the CPUC for approval to begin solicitations.  The pilot aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an earnings opportunity in motivating utilities to source DERs.  On October 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a draft resolution that proposed modifications to the Utility’s pilot program. On December 14, 2017, the CPUC granted the Utility’s November 20, 2017 request to cancel the current pilot project proposal due to the damage of the Utility’s facilities in the area of the Northern California wildfires and propose a new pilot program location by May 1, 2018.

2015 – 2016 Energy Efficiency Incentive Awards

On December 14, 2017, the CPUC approved a final 2015 – 2016 energy savings performance incentive award of $21.9 million, compared to the Utility’s request of $24.7 million. The award was fully offset by a portion of the remaining reduction approved in the settlement agreement related to the rehearing of the 2006 – 2008 risk/reward incentive mechanism.  The settlement agreement requires the Utility to reduce future energy efficiency shareholder incentives by a total of $29.1 million, of which $5.8 million was used to offset the 2014 – 2015 award.  The remaining settlement reduction of $1.3 million will be offset against future energy saving performance incentive awards.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES

The California Legislature and the CPUC have adopted requirements, policies, and decisions to implement new state law requirements applicable to natural gas storage facilities, accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (including solar installations), increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to customers, improve fire safety regulations, and foster the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage the use of electric vehicles.  In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements to reform electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service, and reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes.  CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below.

74

The Utility’s ability to recover its costs, including investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and other operating costs, will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service.

Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR

On April 25, 2017, the Utility, along with Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company, filed a joint application with the CPUC on how to allocate costs associated with long-term power commitments in a manner that ensures all customers are treated equally.  At issue is how customers within communities that choose to implement CCA power arrangements and those served under direct access pay for their share of the costs.  The utilities believe that these customers are not paying their full share of costs associated with the long-term commitments, which results in other customers paying more, which is inconsistent with state law.  The Utility is committed to helping create a cost allocation method that treats all customers fairly and equally, whether they continue to receive service from the Utility or choose a CCA or direct access provider.  The Utility projects that more than half of its customers will purchase electricity from a CCA or direct access provider by 2020.  Without changes to the current cost allocation system, a portion of the contract and facilities costs will be shifted to customers who remain with the Utility or live in areas that do not have access to alternative electricity providers.  The utilities’ joint proposed approach would replace the current system, which is known as the PCIA, with an updated system known as the Portfolio Allocation Methodology.

On June 29, 2017, the CPUC dismissed the Utility’s joint Portfolio Allocation Methodology application without prejudice and instead approved an OIR to review, revise, and consider alternatives to the PCIA.  The OIR will focus on PCIA within the larger context of consumer choice in energy services, and should not be considered a follow-up to the CPUC and Energy Commission Joint En Banc on Customer Choice in California.  On September 25, 2017, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and ruling establishing a procedural schedule and a new overall goal to mitigate cost increases for both bundled and departing load customers.  Testimony is scheduled for the first quarter of 2018.  Evidentiary hearings, if needed, are scheduled for the second quarter of 2018 and a proposed decision is expected by the third quarter of 2018.

Customer Choice

On May 19, 2017, California energy companies, along with other stakeholders discussed customer choice and the future of California’s electric industry at a CPUC “en banc” meeting.  Specifically, the goal of the meeting was to frame a discussion on the trends that are driving change within California’s electricity sector and overall clean-energy economy and to lay out elements of a path forward to ensure that California achieves its reliability, affordability, equity, and carbon reduction imperatives while recognizing the important role that technology and customer preferences will play in shaping this future.

On October 11, 2017, the CPUC announced the formation of the California Customer Choice Project to examine the issues and produce a report evaluating regulatory framework options in early 2018.  The CPUC held an informal public workshop on October 31, 2017, to gather stakeholder input on global and national electric market choice models, including California’s 2020 market.  The project may produce a white paper that will provide a framework to evaluate customer choice models based on affordability, decarbonization, and reliability.  The white paper will not present a recommendation nor is it intended to provide the basis for instituting a rulemaking.  While the CPUC had indicated its intent to open a proceeding related to customer choice, the Utility is unable to predict whether that remains the CPUC’s intent or the timing of any such proceeding.

75

Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Development

In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing EV charging infrastructure to support California’s climate goals.  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, and maintain EV charging stations and the associated infrastructure.  On December 15, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision establishing a three-year EV program of $130 million (approximately $109 million in capital expenditures) to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations.  Further deployment of light-duty EV infrastructure will be considered in a second phase of the proceeding.

Transportation Electrification (TE)

California Law (SB 350) requires the CPUC, in consultation with the CARB and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to file applications for programs and investments to accelerate widespread TE.  In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TE applications which include both short-term projects (of up to $20 million in total) and two- to five-year programs with a requested revenue requirement determined by the Utility.  On January 20, 2017, the Utility filed its TE application with the CPUC requesting a total of up to $253 million (approximately $211 million in capital expenditures) in program funding over five years (2018 - 2022) related to make-ready infrastructure for TE in medium to heavy-duty vehicle sectors, fast charging stations, and short-term projects which includes a series of TE demonstration projects and pilot programs.  On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved, with modifications, four out of the five short-term projects proposed by the Utility for a total of approximately $8 million.  The CPUC may issue a proposed decision on the make-ready infrastructure proposals in the first or second quarter of 2018.

Fire Safety OIR

On December 14, 2017, the CPUC approved new regulations to enhance the fire safety of overhead electric transmission and distribution lines located in high fire-threat areas.  This is the culmination of a decade-long effort to improve the fire safety of overhead utility and communication infrastructure across California.  The SED conferred with Cal Fire, California IOUs, and fire safety professionals, to develop and adopt a statewide fire-threat map.  This map, in conjunction with a United States Forest Service and Cal Fire map of tree mortality high hazard zones, will dictate the application of the new fire safety regulations. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved the final fire safety map associated with the new regulations.

The new regulations include increased patrol frequency for overhead facilities, expanded vegetation clearances around powerlines, and give the utilities increased authority to de-energize lines on private property for the removal of trees that pose an immediate threat to fire safety.  The costs associated with the implementation of these new regulations will be tracked in a fire hazard prevention memorandum account and requested for recovery through rates.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes; the reporting and reduction of CO2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and counterparty credit.

The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e. risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.  The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases.

76

Commodity Price Risk

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  As long as the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affect earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows.  The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.  The Utility recovers these costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts, resulting in price and volumetric risk.  The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks.  The Utility’s value-at-risk was approximately $8 million and $7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  During 2017, the Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values-at-risk were $8 million, $7 million and $7 million, respectively. During 2016, the value-at-risk amounts were $7 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of price risk management activities.)

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash investments, the impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $12 million and $13 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of interest rates.)

Energy Procurement Credit Risk

The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor-owned electric utilities, municipal utilities, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the United States and Canada.  If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.

The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below).  Credit collateral may be in the form of cash or letters of credit.  The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility).  Credit collateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net receivables and replacement cost exposure exceed contractually specified limits.

The following table summarizes the Utility’s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties:

 Net Credit
----------------- -------------- - ---------- ------------ - -------------- -------------- - -- - --
 Number of Exposure to
 Gross Credit Wholesale Wholesale
 Exposure Customers or Customers or
 Before Credit Credit Net Credit Counterparties Counterparties
(in millions) Collateral (1) Collateral Exposure (2) >10% >10%
December 31, 2017 $ 40 $ (16) $ 24 2 12
December 31, 2016 $ 69 $ (11) $ 58 3 39

(1) Gross credit exposure equals mark-to-market value on physically and financially settled contracts, and net receivables (payables) where netting is contractually allowed.  Gross and net credit exposure amounts reported above do not include adjustments for time value or liquidity.

(2) Net credit exposure is the Gross Credit Exposure Before Credit Collateral minus Credit Collateral (cash deposits and letters of credit posted by counterparties and held by the Utility).  For purposes of this table, parental guarantees are not included as part of the calculation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  These accounting policies and their key characteristics are outlined below.

Regulatory Accounting

As a regulated entity, the Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers.  These amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatory balancing accounts receivable) of $5.6 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $9.9 billion.

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  For some of the Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC.  The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.  The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made.  If regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition.

In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility records a provision based on its best estimate; to the extent there is a high degree of uncertainty in the Utility’s forecast, it will record a provision based on the lower end of the range of possible losses.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.

In 2017, the Utility recorded charges of $47 million for capital expenditures related to cancelled projects and disallowed license renewal costs as part of the Diablo Canyon settlement agreement.  In 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $283 million and $219 million for capital spending that was disallowed related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision and for capital expenditures disallowed based on the final phase two decision in its 2015 GT&S rate case, respectively.  In 2015, the Utility incurred charges of $407 million for capital spending that were disallowed related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision.  The Utility would be required to record charges in future periods to the extent there are additional capital disallowances.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

78

Loss Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded material accruals for various enforcement and legal matters and environmental remediation liabilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.

Enforcement and Litigation Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits.  In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to pay for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential site requiring remedial action.  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation with regulatory agencies.  For example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such notification, the Utility completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on the level of information available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.  Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.

79

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1 billion and $958 million, respectively.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs could increase to as much as $2.1 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements.  Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.

Insurance Receivable

The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third party claims.  The Utility records insurance recoveries only when a third party claim is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.   The assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, discussions with insurers and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Asset Retirement Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and its settlement date can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process.  (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.

At December 31, 2017, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $4.9 billion.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement health care and medical plans for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  Adjustments to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results.  These amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis.  The differences between pension benefit expense recognized in accordance with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable of recovery from customers.  To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability.  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care cost trend rate and the expected return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future plan expenses.

In establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts.  This evaluation suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2018 is 6.8%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% in 2027 and beyond.

80

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of the employee benefit trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Fixed-income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rate of inflation.  For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.2% compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8%.

The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 623 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2017.  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

The following reflects the sensitivity of pension costs and projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:

 Increase Increase in Projected
-------------------------------- ------------- - ------------------------ --- --------------------- - -----
 (Decrease) in Increase in 2017 Pension Benefit Obligation at
(in millions) Assumption Costs December 31, 2017
Discount rate (0.50) % $ 111 $ 1,485
Rate of return on plan assets (0.50) % 73 -
Rate of increase in compensation 0.50 % 61 348

The following reflects the sensitivity of other postretirement benefit costs and accumulated benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:

 Increase Increase in 2017 Increase in Accumulated
----------------------------- ------------- - -------------------- -- ----------------------- - ---
 (Decrease) in Other Postretirement Benefit Obligation at
(in millions) Assumption Benefit Costs December 31, 2017
Health care cost trend rate 0.50 % $ 4 $ 63
Discount rate (0.50) % 4 142
Rate of return on plan assets (0.50) % 10 -

['s climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policy makers notwithstanding a recent change in the federal approach to such matters.  In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).  The Utility forecasts over $1 billion in grid investments through 2020, which would include increased remote control and sensor technology of the grid, integration investments in connection with DER bi-directional energy flows and voltage fluctuations, advanced grid data analytics, grid storage that enables renewable integration, expanded infrastructure for light, medium, and heavy-duty EVs, transmission integration for renewables, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.  In addition, these changes brought about by technological advancements and climate policy may cause a reduction in natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs.  The combination of reduced natural gas load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and potential cost recovery risk.
