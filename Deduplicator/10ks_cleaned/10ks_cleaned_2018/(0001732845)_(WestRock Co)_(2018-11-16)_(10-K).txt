Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We also sell real estate primarily in the Charleston, SC region.

Organization

WestRock was formed on March 6, 2015 for the purpose of effecting the Combination and, prior to the Combination, did not conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. On July 1, 2015, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RockTenn and MWV completed a strategic combination of their respective businesses and RockTenn and MWV each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of WestRock. RockTenn was the accounting acquirer in the Combination.

On May 15, 2016, WestRock completed the Separation, pursuant to which we disposed of our former Specialty Chemicals segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we have presented the financial position and results of operations of our former Specialty Chemicals segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On April 6, 2017, we completed the HH&B Sale. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the of MPS Acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of HH&B of $192.8 million in fiscal 2017. See “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is reported in our Consumer Packaging segment. See “Note 2. Mergers, Acquisitions and Investment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On November 2, 2018, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of KapStone through the Mergers. As a result of the Mergers, among other things, the Company became the ultimate parent of WRKCo, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries. Effective as of the the Effective Time, the Company changed its name to “WestRock Company” and WRKCo changed its name to “WRKCo Inc.”. See “Note 23. Subsequent Events (Unaudited)” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Presentation

We report our financial results of operations in the following three reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our containerboard mill and corrugated packaging operations, as well as our recycling operations; Consumer Packaging, which consists of consumer mills, folding carton, beverage, merchandising displays and partition operations; and Land and Development, which sells real estate, primarily in the Charleston, SC region. Following the Combination and until the completion of the Separation, our financial results of operations had a fourth reportable segment, Specialty Chemicals. Prior to the HH&B Sale, our Consumer Packaging segment included HH&B.

In fiscal 2019, we plan to operate our recycling operations primarily as a procurement function, shifting its focus to the procurement of low cost, high quality fiber for our mill system. As a result, we will no longer record recycling sales.

Acquisitions and Investments

We completed a number of acquisitions in the last three years that expanded our product and geographic scope or allowed us to increase our integration levels, and we expect to continue to evaluate similar potential acquisitions in the future. Below we summarize certain of these acquisitions and investments.

On September 4, 2018, we completed the Schlüter Acquisition. Schlüter is a leading provider of differentiated paper and packaging solutions and a German-based supplier of a full range of leaflets and booklets. The Schlüter Acquisition allows us to further enhance our pharmaceutical and automotive platform and expand our geographical footprint in Europe to better serve our customers. We have included the financial results of the acquired operations in our Consumer Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On January 5, 2018, we completed the Plymouth Packaging Acquisition. The assets we acquired included Plymouth’s “Box on Demand” systems, which are manufactured by Panotec, an Italian manufacturer of packaging machines. The Box on Demand systems enhance our platform and drive differentiation and innovation. These systems, which are located on customers’ sites under multi-year exclusive agreements, use fanfold corrugated to produce custom, on-demand corrugated packaging that is accurately sized for any product type according to the customer’s specifications. Fanfold corrugated is continuous corrugated board, folded periodically to form an accordion-like stack of corrugated material. As part of the transaction, WestRock acquired Plymouth’s equity interest in Panotec and Plymouth’s exclusive right from Panotec to distribute Panotec’s equipment in the U.S. and Canada. We have fully integrated the approximately 60,000 tons of containerboard used by Plymouth annually. We have included the financial results of Plymouth in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On August 1, 2017, we completed the Hannapak Acquisition. Hanna Group is one of Australia’s leading providers of folding cartons to a variety of markets, including beverage, food, confectionery and healthcare. We expect this acquisition will build on our established and growing packaging business in the region. We have included the financial results of the acquired operations in our Consumer Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On July 17, 2017, we completed the Island Container Acquisition. The assets we acquired included a corrugator and corrugated converting operations. We have substantially completed the integration of the 80,000 tons of containerboard used by Island annually into our Corrugated Packaging segment. We have included the financial results of the acquired operations in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On June 9, 2017, we completed the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition. The acquired business provides a comprehensive suite of products and services to customers in a variety of end markets, including food & beverage, pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics. At the time of the transaction, we expected the acquisition to provide us the opportunity to increase the vertical integration of our Corrugated Packaging segment by approximately 105,000 tons of containerboard annually through the acquired facilities and another 50,000 tons under a long-term supply contract with another company owned by the seller, and we have since completed the integration of these tons. We have included the financial results of U.S. Corrugated in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On June 6, 2017, we completed the MPS Acquisition. MPS is a global provider of print-based specialty packaging solutions and its differentiated product offering includes premium folding cartons, inserts, labels and rigid packaging. At the time of the transaction, we expected the acquisition to increase our annual paperboard consumption by approximately 225,000 tons. We are well underway, and we currently expect approximately 100,000 tons to be supplied by us by the first half of fiscal 2019. We have included the financial results of MPS in our Consumer Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On March 13, 2017, we completed the Star Pizza Acquisition. The transaction provided us with a leadership position in the fast growing small-run pizza box market and increased our vertical integration. We have fully integrated the approximately 22,000 tons of containerboard used by Star Pizza annually. We have included the financial results of the acquired operations in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On April 1, 2016, we completed the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi to combine our respective operations in Mexico. We contributed cash and the stock of an entity that owns three corrugated packaging facilities in Mexico in return for a 25.0% ownership interest in the joint venture together with future put and call rights. In April 2017, the joint venture entity had a stock redemption from a minority partner which increased our ownership interest to approximately 27.0%. On October 20, 2017, we increased our ownership interest to approximately 32.3% through a $108 million capital contribution. The joint venture operates paper machines, corrugated packaging and high graphic folding carton facilities across various production sites. The majority equity holders of Grupo Gondi

34

manage the joint venture and we provide technical and commercial resources. We believe the joint venture is helping us to grow our presence in the attractive Mexican market. We have included the financial results of the joint venture in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of formation. We are accounting for the investment on the equity method.

On January 19, 2016, we completed the Packaging Acquisition. The entities acquired provide value-added folding carton and litho-laminated display packaging solutions. We believe the transaction has provided us with attractive and complementary customers, markets and facilities. We have included the financial results of the acquired entities in our Consumer Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

On October 1, 2015, we completed the SP Fiber Acquisition. The transaction included the acquisition of mills located in Dublin, GA and Newberg, OR, which produce lightweight recycled containerboard and kraft and bag paper. The Newberg mill also produced newsprint. As part of the transaction, we also acquired SP Fiber's 48% interest in Green Power Solutions of Georgia, LLC (“GPS”), which we consolidate. GPS is a joint venture providing steam to the Dublin mill and electricity to Georgia Power. Subsequent to the transaction, we announced the permanent closure of the Newberg mill due to the decline in market conditions of the newsprint business and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard system. We have included the financial results of the acquired entities in our Corrugated Packaging segment since the date of the acquisition.

Business

 Year Ended September 30,
-------------- ------------------------ -------- ---- - -------- ---- - --------
(In millions) 2018 2017 2016

Net sales $ 16,285.1 $ 14,859.7 $ 14,171.8
Segment income $ 1,685.0 $ 1,193.5 $ 1,226.2

In fiscal 2018, we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win. We successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2018 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment. Net sales of $16,285.1 million for fiscal 2018 increased $1,425.4 million, or 9.6%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment sales, driven by higher selling price/mix and the contributions from acquisitions, and increased Consumer Packaging segment sales, primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions (primarily the MPS Acquisition). These increases were partially offset by the absence of net sales from HH&B in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of HH&B in April 2017 and lower Land and Development segment sales compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the Consumer Packaging segment. Segment income increased $491.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased Corrugated Packaging segment income. With respect to segment income, we experienced higher levels of cost inflation during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, which was partially offset by recycled fiber deflation. The primary inflationary items were freight costs, chemical costs, virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs. Productivity improvements in fiscal 2018 more than offset the net impact of cost inflation. While it is difficult to predict specific inflationary items, we expect higher cost inflation to continue through fiscal 2019.

Our Corrugated Packaging segment increased its net sales by $695.1 million in fiscal 2018 to $9,103.4 million from $8,408.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher corrugated selling price/mix and higher corrugated volumes (including acquisitions), which were partially offset by lower net sales from recycling operations due to lower recycled fiber costs, lower sales related to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency. North American box shipments increased 4.1% on a per day basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $454.0 million to $1,207.9 million compared to $753.9 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher selling price/mix, lower recycled fiber costs and productivity improvements which were partially offset by higher levels of cost inflation and other items, including increased depreciation and amortization.

Our Consumer Packaging segment increased its net sales by $838.9 million in fiscal 2018 to $7,291.4 million from $6,452.5 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions (primarily the MPS Acquisition) and higher selling price/mix partially offset by the absence of net sales from HH&B in fiscal 2018 due to the HH&B Sale in April 2017 and lower volumes. Segment income attributable to

35

the Consumer Packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $28.8 million to $454.6 million compared to $425.8 million in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization (excluding the MPS Acquisition), higher selling price/mix and income from acquisitions, which were partially offset by cost inflation and other items, the absence of income from HH&B in fiscal 2018 due to the HH&B Sale in April 2017 and lower volumes. Consumer Packaging’s segment income in fiscal 2017 included a $25.1 million acquisition inventory step-up charge related primarily to the MPS Acquisition.

Our Land and Development segment sales were $142.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $243.8 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the timing of land sales associated with our accelerated monetization. We expect to complete the monetization of our portfolio during fiscal 2019. After we complete the monetization, the segment will cease to exist. Segment income attributable to the Land and Development segment was $22.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $13.8 million in fiscal 2017.

We generated $2,420.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018, compared to $1,900.5 million in fiscal 2017. We remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy during fiscal 2018 by investing $999.9 million in capital expenditures, deployed $347.9 million to strategic acquisitions and investments while returning $440.9 million in dividends and $195.1 million to our stockholders in share repurchases. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance. In fiscal 2019, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion, including KapStone. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information.

A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance appears below under “Results of Operations (Consolidated)” and “Results of Operations — Segment Data”.

Non-GAAP Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, we have included financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies.

We use the non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations” and “Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share”. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide our board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because the measures exclude restructuring and other costs, and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operating results. We and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share are Income from continuing operations and Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, respectively. The GAAP results in the tables that follow for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent to the line items “Income from continuing operations before income taxes”, “Income tax benefit (expense)” and “Income from continuing operations”, respectively, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $7.34 in fiscal 2018 compared to $2.77 in fiscal 2017 and $0.59 in fiscal 2016. Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share were $4.09, $2.62 and $2.52 in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share to Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure (in dollars per share) for the periods indicated.

We discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “Note 3. Restructuring and Other Costs” and “Note 4. Retirement Plans”, “Note 5. Income Taxes” and See “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business”.

Net Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)

Net sales in fiscal 2018 increased $1,425.4 million, or 9.6%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to increased Corrugated Packaging segment sales, driven by higher selling price/mix and contributions from acquisitions and increased Consumer Packaging segment sales, primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions (primarily the MPS Acquisition). These increases in segment sales were partially offset by the absence of net sales from HH&B in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of HH&B in April 2017. In addition, Land and Development segment sales were lower compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the Consumer Packaging segment.

Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $687.9 million to $14,859.7 million compared to $14,171.8 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment sales, including the partial period impact of the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition and the Island Container Acquisition, an increase in Land and Development segment sales due to the accelerated monetization and a net increase in Consumer Packaging segment sales associated with the MPS Acquisition and the Hannapak Acquisition, partially offset by factors that included the absence of full year net sales from HH&B in fiscal 2017 due to the sale of HH&B.

The change in net sales by segment is outlined in the “Results of Operations — Segment Data” section below.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold increased to $12,891.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $12,119.5 million in fiscal 2017. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 79.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to 81.6% in fiscal 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increased net sales associated with the impact of acquisitions (primarily the MPS Acquisition) and higher levels of cost inflation. The primary inflationary items were freight costs, chemical costs, virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs. These factors were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with HH&B in fiscal 2018 due to the HH&B Sale, productivity improvements, lower recycled fiber costs and decreased land sales. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales also decreased as a result of higher selling prices, primarily in our Corrugated Packaging segment. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 included $1.0 million and $26.5 million, respectively, for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact.

39

Cost of goods sold increased to $12,119.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $11,413.2 million in fiscal 2016. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 81.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to 80.5% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost inflation, primarily recycled fiber, as well as increased land sales due to the accelerated monetization and the net impact of acquisitions offset by the impact of the HH&B Sale and other items. In addition, fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the several hurricanes. These factors were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 included $26.5 million and $8.1 million for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, net of related LIFO impact, respectively.

We discuss these items in greater detail below in “Results of Operations — Segment Data”.

Selling, General and Administrative Excluding Intangible Amortization

Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) excluding intangible amortization increased $93.7 million to $1,493.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 and 2018 that were partially offset by the impact of the HH&B Sale. SG&A as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2018 to 9.2% from 9.4% in fiscal 2017, in part, due to higher selling prices.

SG&A excluding intangible amortization increased $20.2 million to $1,399.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,379.4 million in fiscal 2016, due primarily to acquisitions. SG&A excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to 9.7% in fiscal 2016.

Selling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization

SG&A intangible amortization was $296.6 million, $229.6 million and $211.8 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018 and 2017, notably the MPS Acquisition. The increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017, as well as the full year impact of the Packaging Acquisition compared to nine months of impact in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by the impact of the HH&B Sale.

Multiemployer Pension Withdrawals

In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from PIUMPF and Central States and recorded aggregate estimated withdrawal liabilities of $184.2 million, which includes an estimate of our portion of PIUMPF’s accumulated funding deficiency. Since these withdrawal liabilities assume payment over 20 years, the liabilities were discounted at a credit adjusted risk-free rate and therefore we will accrete the liability over time with a charge to interest expense. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans — Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with the MEPPs in Which We Participate”.

Pension Risk Transfer Expense

In fiscal 2016, we used plan assets to settle $2.5 billion of pension obligations of the Plan by purchasing group annuity contracts from Prudential. This transaction transferred payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately 35,000 U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $370.7 million pre-tax. The settlement reduced our overall U.S. pension obligations and assets by approximately 40%. The monthly retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. Those plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the Plan, and responsibility for payment of their retirement benefits remains with us. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Pension Lump Sum Settlement Expense

In fiscal 2017, lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the Plan, together with several one-time severance benefit payments out of the Plan, triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in a $32.6 million non-cash charge to our earnings. The lump sum payments were to certain eligible former employees who were not currently receiving a monthly benefit. Eligible former employees whose present value of future pension benefits exceeded a certain minimum threshold had the option to either voluntarily accept lump sum payments or to not accept the offer and continue to be entitled to their monthly benefit upon retirement. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Land and Development Impairments

In fiscal 2018, we recorded $31.9 million of pre-tax non-cash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate. The $23.6 million impairment of mineral rights was driven by the non-renewal of a lease, and the other $8.3 million was recorded to write-down the carrying value on real estate projects. Similarly, in fiscal 2017, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash real estate impairment of $46.7 million, or $39.7 million net of $7.0 million of noncontrolling interest. Due to the accelerated monetization in our Land and Development segment, the real estate impairments in both years were recorded to write-down the carrying value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value. The charge is not reflected in segment income.

Restructuring and Other Costs

We recorded aggregate pre-tax restructuring and other costs of $105.4 million, $196.7 million and $366.4 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility. Costs recorded in each period are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring, acquisition, divestiture or integration vary. The restructuring and other costs exclude the Specialty Chemicals costs, which are included in discontinued operations in fiscal 2016. See “Note 3. Restructuring and Other Costs” and “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a description of the type of costs incurred. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is possible that we may engage in additional restructuring opportunities in the future. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Incur Additional Restructuring Costs and May Not Realize Expected Benefits from Restructuring”.

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net was $293.8 million, $222.5 million and $212.5 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense, net in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to debt incurred as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2017 and 2018, as well as an increase in market interest rates. The increase in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to debt incurred as a result of acquisitions. Interest expense, net in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was reduced by $31.0 million, $34.5 million and $44.5 million, respectively, related to the amortization of the fair value of debt stepped-up in purchase accounting. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 amortization of debt issuance costs charged to interest expense, net were $6.3 million, $4.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — The Level of Our Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Impair Our Ability to Operate Our Business”.

Other Income, net

Other income, net was $12.7 million, $11.5 million and $14.4 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income, net in fiscal 2018 included a $12.3 million gain on the sale of our solid waste management brokerage services business. Other income, net in fiscal 2017 primarily included income from the sale of certain investments. Other income, net in fiscal 2016 included a $12.1 million gain on investment in Grupo Gondi related to the three corrugated box plants we contributed to the joint venture.

Gain on Sale of HH&B

On April 6, 2017, we announced that we had completed the HH&B Sale. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $192.8 million. We used the proceeds from the HH&B Sale in connection with the MPS Acquisition.

Provision for Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, (ii) the acceleration of expensing for certain business assets, (iii) the one-time transition tax related to the transition of U.S. international tax from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, (iv) the repeal of the domestic production deduction, (v) additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and (vi) expanded limitations on executive compensation. The key impacts of the Tax Act on our financial statements in fiscal 2018 were the remeasurement of deferred tax balances to the new

41

corporate tax rate and an accrual for the one-time transition tax liability. See “Note 5. Income Taxes — Impacts of the Tax Act” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We recorded income tax benefit from continuing operations of $874.5 million, at an effective tax rate benefit of 84.5% in fiscal 2018, including the $1,128.8 million provisional benefit of the Tax Act, as compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of $159.0 million, at an effective tax rate of 18.5% in fiscal 2017, and compared to an income tax expense from continuing operations of $89.8 million, at an effective tax rate expense of 36.7% in fiscal 2016.

The effective tax rate benefit from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to (i) the provisional amounts related to the enactment of the Tax Act, (ii) favorable tax items, such as the domestic production deduction, tax benefit of share-based compensation and cash tax planning that resulted in reduced deferred tax liabilities (iii) true up of certain deferred taxes and foreign tax returns, and (iv) a change in valuation allowance, partially offset by (v) the inclusion of state taxes and (vi) the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations.

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) low rates of tax applicable to the HH&B Sale, (ii) a $28.7 million tax benefit related to the reduction of a state deferred tax liability as a result of an internal U.S. legal entity restructuring that simplified future operating activities within the U.S., (iii) favorable tax items, such as the domestic manufacturer’s deduction, (iv) lower tax rates applied to foreign earnings, primarily in Canada, and (v) a change in valuation allowance due to realization of capital loss carryforward, partially offset by (vi) the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations and (vii) the inclusion of state taxes.

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 was different than the statutory rate primarily due to (i) the impact of state taxes, (ii) the ability to claim the domestic manufacturer’s deduction against U.S. taxable earnings, (iii) the deconsolidation of a subsidiary related to the Grupo Gondi joint venture, including non-deductible goodwill disposed of in connection with the transaction, and (iv) an increase in valuation allowances and a tax rate differential with respect to foreign earnings primarily in Canada.

See “Note 5. Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Loss from Discontinued Operations

On May 15, 2016, we completed the Separation. Subsequent to the Separation, the operating results of our former Specialty Chemicals segment are reported as discontinued operations. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $544.7 million for fiscal 2016 as a result of goodwill and intangible impairments, and restructuring and other costs being partially offset by income from operations.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, in light of changing market conditions, expected revenue and earnings of the reporting unit, lower comparative market valuations for companies in Specialty Chemicals’ peer group and the results of our preliminary “Step 2” test, we concluded that an impairment of the Specialty Chemicals reporting unit was probable and could be reasonably estimated. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $478.3 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, in conjunction with the Separation, we performed an impairment assessment under the held for sale model and recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $101.1 million for a customer relationships intangible. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Results of Operations — Segment Data

We report our financial results of operations in the following three reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our containerboard mill and corrugated packaging operations, as well as our recycling operations; Consumer Packaging, which consists of consumer mills, folding carton, beverage, merchandising displays and partition operations; and Land and Development, which sells real estate, primarily in the Charleston, SC region. Following the Combination and until the completion of the Separation, our financial results of operations had a fourth reportable segment, Specialty Chemicals. Prior to the HH&B Sale, our Consumer Packaging segment included HH&B.

(1) Net Sales before intersegment eliminations

44

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Net sales before intersegment elimination for the Corrugated Packaging segment increased $695.1 million in the fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to $683.5 million of higher corrugated selling price/mix, and $156.7 million of higher corrugated volumes (including acquisitions), which were partially offset by $84.5 million of lower net sales from our recycling operations primarily due to lower recycled fiber prices, $36.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts and $24.4 million of other items, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017.

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Corrugated Packaging segment increased $539.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to $321.8 million of higher corrugated selling price/mix, $143.9 million of higher net sales of our recycling operations, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices, $98.2 million of higher corrugated volumes, including acquisitions, and $55.9 million of favorable foreign currency impacts. These increases were partially offset by an estimated $45.0 million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and a net $42.2 million of lower corrugated net sales due to a shift in sales from converted boxes in the prior year period to sales of containerboard in fiscal 2017 as a result of having contributed three box plants to the Grupo Gondi joint venture in April 2016.

Segment Income — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $454.0 million compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to an estimated $529.8 million of higher corrugated selling price/mix, an estimated $110.7 million of productivity improvements and $25.2 million of higher corrugated volumes (including acquisitions). These increases were partially offset by an estimated $78.9 million of increased depreciation and amortization, $52.2 million for the net impact of cost inflation, and an estimated $80.6 million of other items including $20.4 million of lower contributions from our recycling operations driven by lower recycled fiber costs, an estimated $19.0 million impact of start-up issues following major maintenance outages partially offset by a $9.5 million lower asset retirement obligations adjustment than in the prior year. The net impact of cost inflation included lower recycled fiber costs that were more than offset by higher freight costs, chemical costs, virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs compared to the prior year. The increased depreciation and amortization was primarily a function of acquisitions, capital investments and $17.1 million of increased SG&A intangible amortization due to acquisitions, and included $27.0 million of accelerated depreciation associated with assets being replaced due to projects to install a 330” state-of-the-art kraft linerboard machine at our Florence, South Carolina mill and to build a new corrugated box plant in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo.

Segment income attributable to the Corrugated Packaging segment in fiscal 2017 increased $14.0 million to $753.9 million compared to $739.9 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an estimated $285.4 million of favorable selling price/mix, $154.4 million of synergy and productivity improvements and $21.0 million of favorable corrugated volumes, including acquisitions. These factors were largely offset by an estimated $380.0 million of cost inflation, the impact of several hurricanes and legal charges that reduced segment income by an estimated $40.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization of $18.3 million. The primary inflation resulted from materials, energy, freight, and wage and other costs.

Consumer Packaging Segment

Consumer Packaging Shipments

Consumer Packaging Shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent, which includes external and intersegment tons shipped from our Consumer Packaging mills plus Consumer Packaging converting shipments converted from BSF to tons. The shipment data table excludes dispensing sales (prior to the April 6, 2017 HH&B Sale) and merchandising displays since there is not a common unit of measure, as well as gypsum paperboard liner tons produced by Seven Hills since it is not consolidated.

(1) Net Sales before intersegment eliminations

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Consumer Packaging Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Consumer Packaging segment increased $838.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the $1,143.1 million increase in net sales from acquisitions (primarily the MPS Acquisition) and $66.6 million of higher selling price/mix, partially offset by the absence of net sales from HH&B (which totaled $297.6 million in the prior year period) due to the HH&B Sale and $71.1 million of lower volumes. The volume decline primarily reflects lower sales of merchandising displays and lower pulp shipments.

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Consumer Packaging segment increased $64.4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of $575.1 million of aggregate net sales from the MPS Acquisition, the Packaging Acquisition and the Hannapak Acquisition, which were largely offset by $188.5 million of lower volumes, a $276.8 million decrease in net sales related to the absence of net sales from HH&B since April 2017, $26.1 million of unfavorable selling price/mix and an estimated $20.0 million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017.

Segment Income — Consumer Packaging Segment

Segment income attributable to the Consumer Packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $28.8 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an estimated $140.6 million of productivity improvements, an increase of $60.5 million of segment income related to the MPS Acquisition, $30.5 million of lower depreciation and amortization (excluding the MPS Acquisition), an estimated $31.6 million of higher selling price/mix and a $20.1 million favorable acquisition reserve adjustments, all of which were largely offset by an estimated $178.1 million of cost inflation, $38.8 million related to the absence of income from HH&B, $16.7 million for the impact of lower volumes compared to the prior year period and other items. The net impact of cost inflation included lower recycled fiber that was more than offset by higher freight costs, chemical costs, virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs compared to the prior year period. Consumer Packaging segment income in fiscal 2017 was reduced by $25.1 million of acquisition inventory step-up expense primarily related to the MPS Acquisition.

47

Segment income attributable to the Consumer Packaging segment in fiscal 2017 decreased $55.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an estimated $169.2 million of cost inflation, $50.2 million for the impact of lower volumes, the $25.7 million impact of lower income from HH&B in fiscal 2017 as compared to the full year in fiscal 2016, a $20.4 million increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 for the expensing of inventory stepped-up in purchase accounting, primarily related to the MPS Acquisition in fiscal 2017 and the Packaging Acquisition in fiscal 2016, an estimated $12.2 million related to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and $8.8 million of lower selling price/mix. These factors were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements of an estimated $203.8 million, a $29.4 million contribution from the operations acquired in the MPS Acquisition prior to expensing $24.7 million of inventory step-up and $15.3 million of lower depreciation and amortization expense. The lower depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a $10.1 million pre-tax benefit from ceasing recording depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 in HH&B since it was designated as held for sale. The primary inflation resulted from materials, energy, freight, and wage and other costs.

(1) Net sales before intersegment eliminations

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Land and Development Segment

Net sales for the Land and Development segment in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $142.4 million, $243.8 million and $119.8 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2018 and the increase in fiscal 2017 were due to the timing of land sales as we monetize the portfolio. We include the remainder of the real estate holdings in assets held for sale because we have met the held for sale criteria. We expect to complete the monetization of these holdings during fiscal 2019. After we complete the monetization, the segment will cease to exist.

Segment Income (Loss) — Land and Development Segment

Segment income attributable to the Land and Development segment was $22.5 million, $13.8 million and $4.6 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The segment’s assets were stepped-up to fair value in fiscal 2015 as a result of purchase accounting, which resulted in substantially lower margins on the properties sold compared to earlier levels. The pre-tax non-cash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate discussed above under the caption “Land and Development Impairments” are not included in segment income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

On January 29, 2018, we announced that a definitive agreement had been signed for us to acquire all of the outstanding shares of KapStone for $35.00 per share and the assumption of approximately $1.36 billion in net debt, for a total enterprise value of approximately $4.9 billion. In contemplation of the transaction, on March 6, 2018, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2025 and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2028 in an unregistered offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In addition, on March 7, 2018, we entered into the Delayed Draw Credit Facilities (as hereinafter defined) that provide for $3.8 billion of senior unsecured term loans. On November 2, 2018, in connection with the closing of the KapStone Acquisition, we drew upon the facility in full. The proceeds of the Delayed Draw Credit Facilities (as hereinafter defined) and other sources of cash were used to pay the consideration for the KapStone Acquisition, to repay certain existing indebtedness of KapStone and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the KapStone Acquisition.

We fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and investments, restructuring activities, dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our New A/R Sales Agreement (as hereinafter defined), proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities. See “Note 13. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations, including cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As such, our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations.

At September 30, 2018, excluding the Delayed Draw Credit Facilities, we had approximately $3.2 billion of availability under our committed credit facilities, primarily under our revolving credit facility, the majority of which matures on July 1, 2022. This liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases.

Certain restrictive covenants govern our maximum availability under the credit facilities. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required and we were in compliance with all of these covenants at September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, we had $104.9 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon.

Cash and cash equivalents were $636.8 million at September 30, 2018 and $298.1 million at September 30, 2017. We used a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents on hand at September 30, 2018 in connection with the closing of the KapStone Acquisition. Approximately 20% of the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2018 were held outside of the U.S. At September 30, 2018, total debt was $6,415.2 million, $740.7 million of which was current. At September 30, 2017, total debt was $6,554.8 million, $608.7 million of which was current.

Cash Flow Activity

 Year Ended September 30,
----------------------------------------- ------------------------ -------- - ---- - -------- ---- - -------- -
(In millions) 2018 2017 2016

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,420.9 $ 1,900.5 $ 1,688.4
Net cash used for investing activities $ (1,298.9 ) $ (1,285.8 ) $ (1,351.4 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (755.1 ) $ (655.4 ) $ (231.0 )

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 increased $520.4 million from fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower cash taxes due to the impact of the Tax Act. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 increased $212.1 million from fiscal 2016 primarily due to a $111.6 million net increase in cash flow from working capital changes plus higher after-tax cash proceeds from our Land and Development segment’s accelerated monetization. The changes in working capital in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included a source of cash resulting from the sale of $115.1 million, $64.7 million and $99.4 million, respectively, of accounts receivables in connection with the A/R Sales Agreement.

Net cash used for investing activities of $1,298.9 million in fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of $999.9 million for capital expenditures, $239.9 million for cash paid for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired primarily

49

related to the Plymouth Acquisition and the Schlüter Acquisition, and $108.0 million for an investment in Grupo Gondi. These investments were partially offset by $24.0 million of proceeds from the sale of certain affiliates as well as our solid waste management brokerage services business and $23.3 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $778.6 million of capital expenditures, $1,588.5 million for the MPS Acquisition, the U.S. Corrugated Acquisition, the Island Container Acquisition, the Hannapak Acquisition and the Star Pizza Acquisition, partially offset by a $3.5 million receipt of an escrow payment from the Packaging Acquisition and proceeds of $1,005.9 million from the HH&B Sale and of $52.6 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $796.7 million of capital expenditures, $376.4 million for the SP Fiber Acquisition and the Packaging Acquisition, $175.0 million for an investment in Grupo Gondi and $36.5 million for the purchase of debt owed by GPS in connection with the SP Fiber Acquisition partially offset by $31.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.

In fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities of $755.1 million consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $440.9 million and purchases of Common Stock of $195.1 million and net repayments of debt of $120.1 million. In fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $403.2 million, net repayments of debt of $145.2 million and purchases of Common Stock of $93.0 million. In fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $380.7 million, purchases of Common Stock of $335.3 million and $105.0 million of cash and trust funding as a result of the Separation, which was partially offset by net additions to debt of $617.3 million. See “Note 7. Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Our capital expenditures aggregated $999.9 million in fiscal 2018. We expect fiscal 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion, including KapStone and investments to restore operations our Panama City, FL mill following Hurricane Michael. Our base capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 should be approximately $950 million to $1.0 billion, with roughly half invested in maintenance and half invested in high return generating projects. In fiscal 2019, we expect to invest approximately $0.5 billion in strategic projects. The strategic projects include: (i) installation of a 330” state-of-the-art kraft linerboard machine at our Florence, SC mill, (ii) an upgrade of the Tres Barras mill that will add virgin pulping capacity, a biomass power boiler, a turbine generator and other equipment, (iii) construction of a new corrugated box plant in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo, (iv) installation of a curtain coater at our Mahrt, AL mill, and (v) installation of a headbox and upgrade of other areas of a paper machine at our Covington, VA mill. However, it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify, changes in market conditions or to comply with environmental or other regulatory changes. We estimate that we will invest approximately $22 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2019 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance, excluding KapStone. We were obligated to purchase approximately $203 million of fixed assets at September 30, 2018 for various capital projects. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Our Capital Expenditures May Not Achieve the Desired Outcomes or May Be Achieved at a Higher Cost than Anticipated”.

At September 30, 2018, the U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately $117 million in future potential reductions of U.S. federal, state and foreign cash taxes. Based on our current projections, we expect to utilize the remaining U.S. federal net operating losses and other U.S. federal credits primarily over the next two years. Foreign and state net operating losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time. It is possible that our utilization of these net operating losses and credits may change due to changes in taxable income, tax laws or tax rates, capital expenditures or other factors. Fiscal 2018 is the last year in which we will receive a tax benefit from the domestic production deduction. Including the estimated impact of book and tax differences, subject to changes in tax laws, we expect our cash tax rate to move closer to our income tax rate in fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021.

During fiscal 2018 and 2017, we made contributions of $37.7 million and $34.5 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Based on current facts and assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $22 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2019. We have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the Pension Act and other regulations. The net over funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at September 30, 2018 was $147.7 million. Based on current assumptions, including future interest rates, we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans will be in the range of approximately $25 million to $27 million annually in fiscal 2020

50

through 2023. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Certain of Our Pension Plans Will Likely Require Additional Cash Contributions”.

In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities. In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from two plans and recorded an aggregate estimated withdrawal liability of $184.2 million. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans — Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Incur Withdrawal Liability and/or Increased Funding Requirements in Connection with the MEPPs in Which We Participate”.

In October 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share, representing a 5.8% increase from the prior $0.43 per share quarterly dividend and an annual dividend of $1.82 per share. During fiscal 2018, we paid an annual dividend of $1.72 per share. During fiscal 2017, we paid an annual dividend of $1.60 per share. During fiscal 2016 we paid an annual dividend of $1.50 per share.

In July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. Shares of our Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors, including the market price of our Common Stock, general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. In fiscal 2018, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $195.1 million. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $93.0 million. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $335.3 million. As of September 30, 2018, we had remaining authorization under the repurchase program authorized in July 2015 to purchase approximately 21.3 million shares of our Common Stock.

We anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends and stock repurchases, pension payments, working capital needs, note repurchases, restructuring activities, repayments of current portion of long-term debt and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our New A/R Sales Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional long-term debt financing, including new or amended facilities. In addition, we continually review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness. In connection with these reviews, we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities, reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness.

Contractual Obligations

We summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at September 30, 2018, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table.

 Payments Due by Period

(1) Includes only principal payments owed on our debt assuming that all of our long-term debt will be held to maturity, excluding scheduled payments. We have excluded $205.2 million of fair value of debt step-up, deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discounts from the table to arrive at actual debt obligations. See “Note 13. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the interest rates that apply to our various debt instruments.

(2) See “Note 14. Operating Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(3) The fair value step-up of $18.5 million is excluded. See “Note 13. Debt — Capital Lease and Other Indebtedness” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

(5) We have included in the table future estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Our estimates are based on factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in our underfunded status based on factors such as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in legislation. It is possible that our assumptions may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute different amounts. We have excluded $247.8 million of multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2018 due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations. See “Note 4. Retirement Plans – Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(6) We have not included the following items in the table:

 • An item labeled “other long-term liabilities” reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these liabilities do not have a definite pay-out scheme.

 • $158.4 million from the line item “Purchase obligations and other” for certain provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes” associated with liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment, if any.

In addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above, we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business. These contracts, however, are subject to change based on our business decisions.

Expenditures for Environmental Compliance

See Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Environmental and Other Matters”, “Business — Governmental Regulation — CERCLA and Other Remediation Costs”, and “Business — Governmental Regulation — Climate Change” for a discussion of our expenditures for environmental compliance.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Certain critical accounting matters are described in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”. These critical accounting matters are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments. The accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in management’s judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates.

Critical accounting matters discussed in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include (i) accounts receivable and allowances; (ii) goodwill and long-lived assets; (iii) restructuring and other costs; (iv) business combinations; (v) fair value of financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities; (vi) income taxes; and (vii) pension and other postretirement benefits.

Accounts Receivable and Allowances

We have an allowance for doubtful accounts, credits, returns and allowances, and cash discounts that serve to reduce the value of our gross accounts receivable to the amount we estimate we will ultimately collect. The allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding our customers’ credit worthiness and the credits, returns and allowances and cash discounts that may be taken by our customers. We derive our accounts receivable from revenue earned from customers located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Given our diverse customer base, we have limited exposure to credit loss from any particular customer or industry segment, and hence we generally do not require collateral in connection with engaging in commercial transactions with them. We perform ongoing evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the particular customer’s current credit worthiness, as determined by our review of their current financial information. We continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers’ financial condition, our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information. Our assessment of this and other information forms the basis of our allowances. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate the allowances. However, while these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we established, it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future depending on changes in business conditions and changes in our customers’ credit worthiness. At September 30, 2018, our accounts receivable, net of allowances of $49.7 million, was $2,010.7 million; a 1% additional loss on accounts receivable would change our allowance by $20.1 million and a 5% change in our allowance assumptions would change our allowance by $2.5 million.

Goodwill

We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. We determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method or, as appropriate, a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method. Our discounted cash flow analysis is based on the sum of two components, the present value of our projected cash flows and the present value of a terminal value. The cash flow estimates are derived from our current forecast and our long-term forecasts prepared for each reporting unit considering historical results and anticipated future performance and capital expenditures, and require considerable judgment. The discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis utilizing a beta derived from peer companies. In addition, we gave consideration in the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital for equity risks, including size risk, industry risk and country specific risk, as appropriate, for each of our reporting units. As a result of the weighted average cost of capital calculations, the

53

discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 8.0% to 13.5%. We use perpetual growth rates in the reporting units that have goodwill ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%. The guideline public company method involves comparing the reporting unit to similar companies whose stock is freely traded on an organized exchange. The fair values determined by the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods were weighted to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit. However, in instances where comparisons to our peers was less meaningful, no weight was placed on the guideline public company method to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit.

Estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. The variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and cash flows, including anticipated changes in revenues and costs and synergies and productivity improvements resulting from the acquisitions, capital expenditures and continuous improvement projects. These factors are interdependent and, therefore, do not change in isolation. Accordingly, our accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors. If we had used other assumptions and estimates or if conditions change in future periods, our operating results could be materially impacted. Any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these reporting units and their prospects, such as changes in our strategy or products, the loss of key customers, regulatory changes or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, of those reporting units that have goodwill, our Consumer Packaging reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, primarily due to the fair value accounting related to the Combination and the MPS Acquisition. If we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill, the fair value of each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value, except for the Consumer Packaging reporting unit. The Consumer Packaging reporting unit had $3,610.9 million of goodwill at September 30, 2018. No events have occurred since the latest annual goodwill impairment assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment. We have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Have a Significant Amount of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and a Write Down Would Adversely Impact Our Operating Results and Shareholders’ Equity”.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. A 1% change in our effective tax rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately $10.3 million for fiscal 2018. A 1% change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets, as recorded on the September 30, 2018 consolidated balance sheet, would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately $97.5 million for fiscal 2018.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The funded status of our qualified and non-qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans increased $69.2 million in fiscal 2018. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension and non-U.S. pension plans were over funded by $137.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018. Our U.S. pension plan benefit obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2018 primarily by a 41-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date. The non-U.S. pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2018 by a 16-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date. A 25-basis point change in the discount rate, compensation level, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets or medical cost trend, factoring in our

54

corridor as appropriate, would have had the following effect on fiscal 2018 pension and other postretirement expense (amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income, in millions):

 Pension Plans Postretirement Plans
------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- - ----------------------- - ---- ----------------------- - --- ----------------------- --- - -
