ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.
During 2015, Apache sold its Australia LNG business and oil and gas assets. Results of operations and cash flows from operations for Australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented.
The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.
Overview of 2017 Results
Throughout 2017, Apache remained dedicated to its mission to grow the Company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, with a focus on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns. The Company focused its capital program on development at Alpine High, which commenced production in May, building associated Alpine High infrastructure, and increasing production and performance in its other Permian Basin plays. Apache’s U.S. assets are complemented by its international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s deep inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generate cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the Company’s ability to develop Alpine High while maintaining financial flexibility. Additionally, Apache monetized certain non-strategic assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near term, including its operations in Canada, its interests in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system (SAGE) in the North Sea, and various non-core leasehold positions in the Permian.
Daily production in 2017 averaged 457 Mboe/d, a decrease of 12 percent from 2016 reflecting the sale of the Company’s Canadian operations. Excluding production from Canada, Apache’s worldwide equivalent daily production decreased 8 percent primarily due to natural decline. The production decline was driven by strategic decisions to curtail capital investments in the two preceding years in order to allow costs to re-align with the lower commodity price environment and to allocate a significant portion of capital investments to the development of the Alpine High field and infrastructure.
During 2017, Apache reported net income attributable to common stock of $1.3 billion, or $3.41 per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion, or $3.71 per share in 2016. Results for 2017 reflect an increase in commodity prices, which resulted in higher revenues and lower impairment charges compared with the prior year, as well as gains on divestitures and tax benefits recognized upon enactment of U.S. tax reform. Revenue gains from significant increases in realized commodity prices mitigated the impact of production declines and loss of production in connection with the sale of our Canadian operations.
Apache generated $2.4 billion in cash from operating activities in 2017, flat with the prior year, and an additional $1.4 billion of cash proceeds from non-core asset divestments. Apache ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $291 million from year-end 2016. In addition, the Company reduced debt from prior-year levels, fully maintained its $3.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, returned $380 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and eliminated over $800 million of future asset retirement obligations with the sale of our Canadian operations. In response to continued commodity price volatility, in 2017 the Company entered into commodity derivatives to secure the pace of its strategically important capital program at Alpine High without compromising its financial strength or flexibility. We continuously monitor changes in our operating environment and have the ability, with our dynamic capital allocation process, to adjust our capital investment program to levels that maximize value for our shareholders over the long-term.
Outlook
Apache currently plans to invest $7.5 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities from 2018 to 2020, with just under $2.5 billion planned for 2018 and slight increases to annual capital spending through 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the Company anticipates investment of $1.0 billion in the midstream development of Alpine High over the next three years. This will include approximately $500 million in 2018, with the remainder split between 2019 and 2020. At current pricing, 2018 projected cash flow from operations are estimated to be cash flow neutral based on the upstream capital program, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. Midstream development and infrastructure build-out will operate at a cash deficit. Any cash deficits for 2018 are anticipated to be funded through our existing cash balances; however, the Company continues discussions on strategic midstream monetization and value optimization that could significantly reduce, or even eliminate, the deficit.

 27

The results of this planned capital investment are projected to achieve a compound annual production growth rate of 11 to 13 percent for Apache’s worldwide operations and 19 to 22 percent in the U.S. over the three-year period. For 2018, Apache’s worldwide adjusted production is anticipated to increase by 7 to 13 percent. Projected growth rates will be driven by the Permian Basin. Egypt and the North Sea operations are anticipated to continue generating cash flow in excess of capital investments. Forecasts show a shallow decline rate for the international regions given planned investment levels; however, the Company anticipates improved capital efficiency in the North Sea with lower day rate contracts by mid-year and fewer obligation wells expected to be drilled.
Approximately two-thirds of Apache’s capital upstream spending from 2018 to 2020 will be allocated to the Permian Basin. Outside of Alpine High, capital investment will be focused on horizontal oil drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins and on moderating the Central Basin Platform decline through continued improved recovery projects. Investment levels could be significantly increased to provide short-term oil growth; however, a deeper understanding of multi-zone reservoir dynamics on a section level will lead to more economic full-field development decisions over the long-term. The Company’s current rig and completion pace allows for sufficient time to collect and analyze complex inter-well and inter-zone data and design optimal spacing and pattern configurations. With most of the Company’s key Midland basin acreage held-by-production, we have time available to ensure long-term value and returns before accelerating our development pace in the context of available cash flow.
The upstream capital investment program for Alpine High will continue to transition from delineation and testing to full development mode, while infrastructure build-out will progress through 2018 and into 2019. During 2018, approximately 50 percent of the drilling program will focus on completing the primary phase of delineation and testing. The remaining capital included in the three-year plan will be split evenly between retention drilling and development drilling. The Alpine High program is expected to progress at a steady and increasingly efficient pace with continued well optimization and a greater proportion of future drilling on multi-well pads. Combined with minimal water handling costs and revenue uplift expected from oil and NGLs present in the wet gas portion of the play, Alpine High investments are anticipated to generate strong cash margins with a competitive recycle ratio compared to other Permian operations.
Operational Highlights
Apache’s deliberate focus on strategic testing and targeted development drilling during the price downturn, in addition to the Alpine High discovery, significantly impacted results in its Permian Basin plays, Egypt, and the North Sea.
Key operational highlights for the year include:
North America

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• North America onshore production averaged 231 Mboe/d, down 16 percent relative to 2016, reflecting Apache’s exit from Canada. Excluding Canada, Apache’s onshore equivalent production decreased 8 percent, in line with the Company’s expectations given the significant reduction in capital investments over the preceding two years and the allocation of a significant portion of our 2017 capital investments to infrastructure at Alpine High.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Permian region averaged 16 operated rigs during the year, drilling 215 gross wells, 145 net wells. Approximately half of the region’s production is crude oil and 23 percent is NGLs. Combined, this represents more than a third of Apache’s worldwide liquids production for 2017. The region averaged 158 Mboe/d and contributed $1.8 billion of revenues during 2017. Fourth-quarter 2017 production increased 19 percent from the comparative 2016 quarter, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp at Alpine High.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Drilling and infrastructure development activities continue at Alpine High; specifically:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ First production from the Alpine High play was achieved in early May 2017. Net production averaged approximately 19.8 Mboe/d during the fourth quarter of 2017 and achieved a rate of 25 Mboe/d in December prior to shutting down a facility at year-end for capacity expansion.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Five processing facilities are currently operating with a combined gross inlet capacity of 330 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcf/d).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ During 2017, Apache invested $550 million in midstream facilities at Alpine High, with development ongoing. Inception-to-date midstream investment as of year-end was $706 million.

 28

International and Offshore

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Egypt region averaged 12 rigs and drilled 94 gross wells. During 2017, Egypt’s gross production and net equivalent production averaged 334 Mboe/d and 162 Mboe/d, respectively. Egypt’s gross production and net equivalent production decreased 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, from 2016, primarily the result of natural well decline. In August 2017, the Company received final award of two new concessions totaling 1.6 million net acres, increasing Apache’s acreage position in the Western Desert by 40 percent. Subsequently, the Company began acquiring high resolution 3-D seismic program across its new and existing acreage, which will provide significantly enhanced imaging of deeper formations.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The North Sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2017, drilling 14 gross wells, 10 net wells. During the year, the region averaged production of 58 Mboe/d and contributed $1.1 billion of revenues. Production declined 16 percent from 2016, primarily the result of extended turnaround activities, a third-party pipeline system outage at the Forties field and natural well decline impacted by exploration dry holes on long-standing obligation wells. The overall decline has been partially offset by the Callater discovery, which came online in late May 2017.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
Over Apache’s 60-year history, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, Apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance Apache’s portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of Apache’s operations in Canada and Australia. These divestments include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Canadian Operations On June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. Divestitures During 2017, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the Permian and Midcontinent/Gulf Coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $798 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• North Sea Gathering Transportation and Processing (GTP) Facility In November 2017, Apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the SAGE gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the Beryl pipeline in the North Sea to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited. A refundable deposit of $134 million was received in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with this transaction, and was recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In November 2017, Apache completed the sale and the liability related to the refundable deposit was released. No additional proceeds were received.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Australia Operations On June 5, 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of the Company’s Australian subsidiary Apache Energy Limited (AEL) to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. Additionally, in October 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd (YPHPL), to Yara International for total proceeds of $391 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• LNG Projects On April 2, 2015 and April 10, 2015, Apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the Wheatstone LNG and Kitimat LNG projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to Woodside Petroleum Limited (Woodside) for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.

Crude Oil Prices
A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for 2017 were up 24 percent compared to 2016, a direct result of the rising benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in 2017 averaged $51.46 per barrel.
Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
Natural Gas Prices
Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. Our North American regions averaged $2.46 per Mcf in 2017, up from $1.97 per Mcf in 2016.

 32

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In Egypt, our gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the region averaged $2.80 per Mcf in 2017, up 3 percent from the prior year.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region averaged $5.54 per Mcf in 2017, a 23 percent increase from an average of $4.51 per Mcf in 2016.

NGL Prices
Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Crude Oil Revenues
2017 vs. 2016   Crude oil revenues for 2017 totaled $4.6 billion, a $426 million increase from the 2016 total of $4.2 billion. An 11 percent decrease in average daily production reduced 2017 revenues by $559 million compared to 2016, while 24 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $985 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 244.3 Mb/d, with prices averaging $51.46 per barrel. Crude oil accounted for 78 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.
Worldwide crude oil production decreased 31.0 Mb/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the Canada divestitures and natural decline.
2016 vs. 2015  Crude oil revenues for 2016 totaled $4.2 billion, a $935 million decrease from the 2015 total of $5.1 billion. A 5 percent decrease in average daily production reduced 2016 revenues by $228 million compared to 2015, while 14 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $707 million. Average daily production in 2016 was 275.3 Mb/d, with prices averaging $41.63 per barrel. Crude oil accounted for 78 percent of Apache’s 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.
Worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 14.4 Mb/d compared to 2015, primarily the result of reduced drilling activity in response to lower commodity prices and natural decline.
Natural Gas Revenues
2017 vs. 2016   Natural gas revenues for 2017 totaled $959 million, an $8 million decrease from the 2016 total of $967 million. A 13 percent decrease in average production reduced 2017 revenues by $148 million compared to 2016, while 14 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $140 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 958 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $2.74 per Mcf. Natural gas accounted for 16 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 35 percent of its worldwide production.
Worldwide gas production decreased 145.0 MMcf/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the Canada divestitures, maintenance activities in the North Sea, and natural decline.
2016 vs. 2015   Natural gas revenues for 2016 totaled $1.0 billion, a $209 million decrease from the 2015 total of $1.2 billion. A 4 percent decrease in average production reduced 2016 revenues by $38 million compared to 2015, while 14 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $171 million. Average daily production in 2016 was 1,103 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $2.40 per Mcf. Natural gas accounted for 18 percent of Apache’s 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 35 percent of its worldwide production.
Worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 46.5 MMcf/d compared to 2015, primarily the result of reduced drilling activity in response to lower commodity prices and natural decline.
NGL Revenues
2017 vs. 2016   NGL revenues for 2017 totaled $330 million, a $102 million increase from 2016. A 15 percent decrease in average production reduced 2017 revenues by $58 million compared to 2016, while 70 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $160 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 53.5 Mb/d, with prices averaging $16.90 per barrel. NGLs accounted for nearly 6 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 12 percent of its worldwide production.

 33

2016 vs. 2015   NGL revenues for 2016 totaled $228 million, essentially unchanged from 2015. A 1 percent increase in average production was offset by 1 percent lower average realized prices. Average daily production in 2016 was 62.7 Mb/d, with prices averaging $9.92 per barrel. NGLs accounted for nearly 4 percent of Apache’s 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 12 percent of its worldwide production.

Operating Expenses
The table below presents a comparison of the Company’s expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. The Company’s discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in Australia.

(1) For expenses impacted by the timing of 2017 and 2016 liftings in the North Sea, per-boe calculations are based on sales volumes rather than production volumes.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed more than half of Apache’s 2017 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
During 2017, LOE decreased $94 million, or 6 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2016. On a per-unit basis, LOE increased $0.53, or 7 percent compared to 2016. During 2016, LOE decreased $360 million, or 19 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2015. On a per-unit basis, LOE decreased $1.50, or 16 percent, compared to 2015. The per-barrel increase during 2017 is primarily the result of declines in production combined with generally rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2017.
Gathering and Transportation
Gathering and transportation expenses include transportation costs paid to a third-party carrier and costs associated with gas processing. As a result of the recent SAGE divestiture, Apache expects to incur additional tariffs ranging from $7 million to $10 million annually on the North Sea Beryl field production.
2017 vs. 2016  Gathering and transportation costs decreased $21 million from 2016. The decrease was directly related to the Canadian divestitures that closed in August 2017.

 34

2016 vs. 2015  Gathering and transportation costs decreased $11 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in volumes and rate changes in Canada, partially offset by rate changes in the Permian Basin.
Taxes Other Than Income
Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the U.S., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT was assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea. The rate of U.K. PRT was reduced to zero percent effective January 2016. We are subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.
2017 vs. 2016  Taxes other than income totaled $151 million, an increase of $25 million from 2016. The increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during 2017 compared to 2016.
2016 vs. 2015  Taxes other than income in 2016 were $156 million lower than 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, the rate of U.K. PRT, historically assessed on qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea, was reduced to zero percent, effective as of January 1, 2016. As a result, U.K. PRT decreased $92 million over the comparable 2015 period. Severance tax decreased $25 million as a result of the decline in oil and gas production and lower prices. Ad valorem taxes decreased $21 million as a result of a decrease in property values in 2016.
Exploration Expense
Exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

---------------------------------- ------------------------------- --- ---- -- ---- --- --- - -----

 For the Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 (In millions)
Unproved leasehold impairments $ 246 $ 272 $ 2,462
Dry hole expense 183 81 133
Geological and geophysical expense 47 44 89
Exploration overhead and other 73 76 87
 $ 549 $ 473 $ 2,771

2017 vs. 2016  Unproved leasehold impairments decreased $26 million compared to 2016, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices. Dry hole expense increased $102 million compared to 2016, primarily related to unsuccessful international offshore exploration.
2016 vs. 2015  Exploration expenses in 2016 decreased $2.3 billion, or 83 percent, compared to 2015, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices reducing unproved leasehold impairments during 2016 in all key geographic areas. Dry hole expense decreased $52 million primarily as a result of reduced capital spending during 2016. Geological and geophysical expense decreased by $45 million during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced capital spending.
General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses
2017 vs. 2016  G&A expenses decreased $15 million, or 4 percent, from 2016. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily related to lower incentive compensation in 2017 compared to 2016, and the Canadian divestitures.
2016 vs. 2015  G&A expenses increased $30 million, or 8 percent, from 2015. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses increased $0.23 to $2.15 per boe. The increase in G&A expense was primarily related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation Costs
Apache recorded $16 million, $39 million and $132 million of expenses during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, primarily related to company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. The charges for 2017 include $11 million for consulting fees related to divestitures and $5 million related to employee separation, consolidation of office space, and other reorganization efforts.

 35

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
2017 vs. 2016  Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $2.1 billion in 2017 decreased $324 million compared to 2016. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased $0.14 per boe in 2017 compared to 2016. The primary factor driving lower absolute dollar expense was a decrease in production volumes from the comparative prior-year periods. Other asset depreciation decreased $14 million compared to 2016 primarily related to the Canadian divestitures.
2016 vs. 2015  Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $2.5 billion in 2016 decreased $516 million compared to 2015. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased $2.09 to $12.92 per boe in 2016 compared to 2015. The primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower DD&A per boe rates was the reduction in the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2015 and 2016. Other asset depreciation decreased $166 million compared to 2015 primarily related to a reduction in the Company’s gas gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) assets as a result of impairments to GTP assets during 2015.
Impairments
During 2017, the Company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling $8 million for a U.K. PRT decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the North Sea.
During 2016, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.1 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $486 million for the impairment of the recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset, $427 million impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Canada, $135 million impairments of certain GTP facilities in the North Sea, and $55 million for inventory write-downs.
During 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $9.5 billion, including $7.4 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $1.7 billion impairments of GTP facilities, a $148 million impairment of its YPHPL equity method investment, $163 million impairment of goodwill in its North Sea reporting unit, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. Oil and gas proved property impairments resulted from lower commodity prices and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Company’s development plans in certain areas. GTP impairments included $555 million for facilities in Canada, $102 million in the U.S., and $1.1 billion in Egypt.
The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for 2017, 2016, and 2015:

Financing Costs, Net
Financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:

----------------------------------- ------------------------------- --- ---- --- ---- --- --- - - ---

 For the Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 (In millions)
Interest expense $ 457 $ 464 $ 486
Amortization of deferred loan costs 9 8 11
Capitalized interest (51 ) (48 ) (15 )
Loss on extinguishment of debt 1 1 39
Interest income (19 ) (8 ) (10 )
Total Financing costs, net $ 397 $ 417 $ 511

2017 vs. 2016  Net financing costs decreased $20 million from 2016. The decrease is primarily related to an increase of $11 million in interest income, an increase of $3 million in capitalized interest, and a decrease of $7 million in interest expense.
2016 vs. 2015  Net financing costs decreased $94 million from 2015. The decrease is primarily related to an increase of $33 million in capitalized interest, a decrease of $22 million in interest expense, and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred in 2015.
Provision for Income Taxes
The 2017 income tax benefit totaled $585 million. During 2017, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the decrease in deferred taxes associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries, gains on the sale of oil and gas properties, the increase in the Company’s valuation allowance, and a decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate causing a remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax asset.
On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law. In addition to reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the Act move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. As a result of the enacted legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company is required to include in its taxable income for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, its pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the Company is a U.S. shareholder. In 2017, the Company recorded a provisional net deferred tax benefit of $822 million to reverse a previously recorded deferred tax liability for unrepatriated earnings and to account for the transition rule under the new law. In addition, and as a result of the decrease in the corporate income tax rate, the Company recorded a provisional $516 million deferred tax expense in 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2017 deferred tax asset.
The 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $442 million. During 2016, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the Company’s PRT decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in U.K. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets.
In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016 which provides income tax relief to Exploration and Production (E&P) companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2015 U.K. deferred income tax liability.
In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of $560 million.

 37

The 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $1.0 billion. The 2015 effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit from $11.9 billion of asset impairments, the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, and an increase in valuation allowance against the Canadian region’s net deferred tax assets. Separately, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015, which provided income tax relief to E&P companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact Apache’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. These changes potentially impact Apache’s liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short-term.
Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of Apache’s drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. During 2017, the Company recognized positive reserve revisions of approximately 2 percent of its year-end 2016 estimated proved reserves as a result of higher prices.
Apache currently plans to invest $7.5 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities from 2018 to 2020, with just under $2.5 billion planned for 2018 and slight increases to annual capital spending through 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the Company anticipates investment of $1.0 billion in the midstream development of Alpine High over the next three years. This will include approximately $500 million in 2018, with the remainder split between 2019 and 2020. At current pricing, 2018 projected cash flow from operations are estimated to be cash flow neutral based on the upstream capital program, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. Midstream development and infrastructure build-out will operate at a cash deficit. Any cash deficits for 2018 are anticipated to be funded through our existing cash balances; however, the Company continues discussions on strategic midstream monetization and value optimization that could significantly reduce, or even eliminate, the deficit. Additionally, to mitigate the downside risk of price volatility and protect our cash flow exposure related to infrastructure costs, the Company has entered into, throughout 2018, put option contracts, fixed price swaps, and option collars over a significant portion of projected crude oil and natural gas sales volumes.
Apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the Company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including Apache’s capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

(1) The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.

Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.
Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2017 totaled $2.4 billion, down $25 million from 2016. The decrease is primarily a result of changes in working capital.
For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Australia Discontinued Operations
During 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Wheatstone LNG project and associated upstream assets to Woodside for total proceeds of $2.8 billion. During 2015, Apache also completed the sale of its Australian subsidiary AEL to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. The results of operations for the divested Australian assets, asset impairments, and losses on disposal are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 40

Asset Divestitures
During 2017, 2016, and 2015, Apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling $1.4 billion, $134 million, and $1.5 billion, respectively. For information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Capital Expenditures
During 2017, 2016, and 2015, capital spending for exploration and development (E&D) activities totaled $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively. Apache’s E&D capital spending was focused primarily in its North American onshore regions. Apache’s investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) facilities totaled $530 million, $158 million, and $233 million during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. GTP expenditures in 2017 and 2016 primarily comprise investments in infrastructure for the Alpine High play.
Apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions for cash totaling $178 million, $181 million, and $367 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our North American onshore portfolio.
Egypt Noncontrolling Interest
Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas business in Egypt. Apache made cash distributions totaling $265 million, $293 million, and $129 million to Sinopec in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Dividends
The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 53 consecutive years through 2017. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2017 totaled $380 million, compared with $379 million in 2016 and $377 million in 2015.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2017, Apache had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $494 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $1.2 billion was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Debt
At December 31, 2017, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.5 billion. The Company has $550 million maturing in 2018, $150 million maturing in 2019, $493 million maturing in 2021, $814 million maturing in 2022, and the remaining maturing in years 2023 through 2096. At December 31, 2017, $150 million of 7.0% senior notes due February 1, 2018 and $400 million of 6.9% senior notes due September 15, 2018 are classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet. On February 1, 2018, Apache’s 7.0% notes in original principal amount of $150 million matured and were repaid.

 41

In November 2016, the Company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled $181 million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for $182 million in cash, including accrued interest and $0.5 million of premium. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in our statement of consolidated operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.
In January 2017, Apache purchased and canceled an additional $69 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $71 million in cash, including accrued interest and $1 million of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.
In August 2017, the Company assumed the obligations of Apache Finance Canada Corporation (AFCC) in respect of $300 million 7.75% notes due in 2029 which AFCC issued and the Company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. The assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto. As a result of the assumption, the Company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and AFCC is released from its obligations thereunder. The $300 million 7.75% notes historically have been included in the Company’s long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the Company’s long-term debt or total debt.
Available Credit Facilities
In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache’s two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at $3.5 billion.
At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2017, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.
The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 31 percent.
The 2015 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
In February 2016, Apache entered into a letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, and rights to increase commitments to £1.075 billion. The facility matures in February 2020 and is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and Canadian dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s 2015 $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.
Commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR margin. Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2017, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.

 42

The 2016 facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, three letters of credit aggregating approximately £129.1 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.
There are no clauses in the 2015 $3.5 billion or 2016 £900 million credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of December 31, 2017.
There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the Company will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.
Commercial Paper Program
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility, which matures in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(1) This table does not include the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 6 and 10, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(2) This represents our capital lease obligation related to our Midland, Texas office building. The imputed interest rate necessary to reduce the net minimum lease payments to present value of the lease term is 4.4 percent or $18 million as of December 31, 2017.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells net of amounts billed to partners will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.

(4) Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Includes amounts related to firm transportation capacity on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project), expected to be in service in October 2019. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities. The Company expects to receive $1 million in sublease income associated with these leases.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $4 million for environmental remediation and approximately $37 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
In addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
With respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued Notice to Lessees (NTL) No. 2016-N01 pertaining to the obligations of companies to provide supplemental assurances for performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, decommissioning, and site clearance obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. Under this NTL, the Company will likely be required to provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with the BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

Insurance Program
We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. Coverage for Gulf of Mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.
Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s interest. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.

Apache has an additional insurance policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.
Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.
Reserves Estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

 45

Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
Purchase Price Allocation
Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must apply various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, the Company prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in “Reserve Estimates” of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.
Oil and Gas Exploration Costs
Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.
Under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.
To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.

 46

Although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.
Over the past three years, the Company has experienced a substantial decline in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. As such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities in 2015 and 2016. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)
The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet included $87 million of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the Egypt reporting unit. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1 of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise, by examining relevant events and circumstances that could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.
If it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit for impairment, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Although we base the fair value estimate of the reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. In the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
Income Taxes
Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...
