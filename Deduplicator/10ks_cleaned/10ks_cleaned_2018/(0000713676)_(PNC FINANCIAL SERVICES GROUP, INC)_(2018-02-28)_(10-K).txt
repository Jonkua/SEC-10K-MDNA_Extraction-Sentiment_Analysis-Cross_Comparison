Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance
We face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report.

Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Global and domestic economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the current U.S. economic expansion;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The monetary policy actions and statements of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC);

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets;

- ----------------------------------------------------
• Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The impact of legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives and actions;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The ability of customers, counterparties and issuers to perform in accordance with contractual terms, and the resulting impact on our asset quality;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The impact on customers and changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or regulatory or legislative initiatives, including newly enacted federal tax legislation.

In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:

- -----------------------------------------------------
• Effectively managing capital and liquidity including:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low-cost stable funding source;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing and liquidity standards; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets.

- -------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------
• Execution of our strategic priorities;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment;

- -------------------------------------------------------------

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for more detail on our 2017 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.

Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. For additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of this Report.

Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our current view that U.S. economic growth will accelerate somewhat in 2018, in light of the recently passed corporate and personal income tax cuts that are expected to support business investment and consumer spending, respectively. Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year, including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for consumer spending. Other sources of growth for the U.S. economy in 2018 will be the global economic expansion and the housing market. Although inflation slowed in 2017, it should pick up as the labor market continues to tighten. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise throughout 2018; PNC’s baseline forecast is for three increases in the federal funds rate in 2018, pushing the rate to a range of 2.00 to 2.25 percent by the end of the year. Longer-term rates are also expected to increase as the Federal Reserve slowly reduces the size of its balance sheet and the federal government borrows more, but at a slower pace than short-term rates, so we anticipate the yield curve will flatten but not invert. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

Our outlook for certain financial information for full year and first quarter 2018 is compared to full year and fourth quarter 2017 results as adjusted for the tax legislation and significant items described in the Income Statement Highlights section of this Executive Summary. For additional information on financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, see the Selected Quarterly Financial Data section in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

For full year 2018 compared to full year 2017 on an adjusted basis, we expect:

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• Loan growth to be up mid-single digits, on a percentage basis;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue to increase mid-single digits, on a percentage basis;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Noninterest expense to increase by low-single digits, on a percentage basis; and

- -----------------------------------------------
• The effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.

For the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 on an adjusted basis, we expect:

- -------------------
• Modest loan growth;

- ---------------------------
• Stable net interest income;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fee income to decrease by low mid-single digits, on a percentage basis, mainly attributable to lower first quarter client activity and elevated fourth quarter fees. Fee income consists of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other noninterest income to be between $250 million and $300 million;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Provision for credit losses to be between $100 million and $150 million; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Noninterest expense to decrease by low-single digits, on a percentage basis.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report.

Net income for 2017 was $5.4 billion, or $10.36 per diluted common share, an increase of 35% compared with $4.0 billion, or $7.30 per diluted common share, for 2016. Higher net income was driven by an 8% increase in total revenue and a tax benefit from the new federal tax legislation, partially offset by a 10% increase in noninterest expense. Revenue growth resulted from a 9% increase in net interest income and a 7% increase in noninterest income.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes In Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this Report.

Net interest income increased $717 million, or 9%, in 2017 compared with 2016 due to increases in loan and securities balances and yields, partially offset by an increase in borrowing and deposit costs. Net interest margin increased largely reflecting the benefit to loans and securities yields from higher interest rates in 2017.

Average investment securities increased $3.0 billion, or 4%, reflecting net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities of $2.9 billion and agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $2.8 billion, partially offset by declines in average commercial mortgage-backed securities of $1.6 billion and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $.8 billion. Total investment securities were 23% of average interest-earning assets in both 2017 and 2016.

Average loans grew by $8.5 billion, or 4%, reflecting an increase in average commercial lending of $8.4 billion driven by broad-based growth in our Corporate Banking, Real Estate, Equipment Finance and Business Credit businesses in our Commercial & Institutional Banking segment. Growth in Equipment Finance included the impact of the acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and leases in the second quarter of 2017. Average consumer lending increased $.1 billion in the comparison, as growth in average residential real estate, automobile and credit card loans was substantially offset by declines in average home equity and education loans. These declines reflected run-off in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolios of brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loans. Average loans represented 67% of average interest-earning assets in 2017 compared to 66% in 2016.

Average total deposits increased $7.2 billion, or 3%, primarily due to growth in average interest-bearing deposits of $6.7 billion, or 4%, driven by higher average savings deposits of $13.1 billion. This increase reflected a shift, in part, to relationship-based savings products from money market deposits, which decreased $9.2 billion. Additionally, average interest-bearing demand deposits grew $4.3 billion, mainly

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  33

attributable to the higher interest rate environment and customer growth. Average interest-bearing deposits represented 76% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2017 compared to 77% in 2016.

Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7.

Noninterest Income

Other 1,198 1,124 74 7 %
Total noninterest income $ 7,221 $ 6,771 $ 450 7 %

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 44% for 2017 and 45% for 2016.

Asset management revenue increased reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock, including a $254 million flow through impact of the new federal tax legislation on our equity investment. Additionally, the impact of stronger equity markets contributed to the increase. Discretionary client assets under management in our Asset Management Group segment increased to $151 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with $137 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to higher equity markets.

Growth in consumer service fees was primarily due to a $25 million increase in credit card fees, net of rewards, and debit card fees, which reflected continued momentum in customer activity in both transaction trends and customer growth. In addition, brokerage fees increased $17 million, driven by higher brokerage assets under management. These increases were partially offset by individually insignificant items.

Corporate services revenue reflected broad based growth, including higher merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory fees of $65 million and an increase in loan syndication and agency fees of $28 million, both of which reflected continued momentum in the M&A market. Higher treasury management revenue also contributed to the increase in corporate services revenue.

Lower residential mortgage revenue reflected a decline of $122 million in residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, which included a $71 million negative adjustment for mortgage servicing rights fair value assumption updates in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, the decrease reflected lower loan sales revenue of

$85 million, which was driven by lower origination volume and compressed pricing margins.

Higher service charges on deposits reflected net growth of $30 million related to fee income on personal deposit accounts, reflecting higher levels of customer activity.

The increase in other noninterest income included higher revenue from private equity investments of $172 million and $119 million for the appreciation of BlackRock common stock used to fund PNC's fourth quarter 2017 contribution to the PNC Foundation. The increase in revenue from private equity investments reflected positive impacts from valuation adjustments on equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule provision of Dodd-Frank. Additionally, operating lease income increased related to the commercial and vendor finance business acquired in the second quarter of 2017.

These increases were largely offset by the impact of negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares of $280 million in 2017, including $248 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to the extension of anticipated timing of litigation resolution. Derivative fair value adjustments relate to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date. In 2016, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, net of derivative fair value adjustments, were $32 million.

Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the Market Risk Management – Equity and Other Investment Risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7.

Effective for the first quarter of 2018, and as a result of the commercial and vendor finance business we acquired in the second quarter of 2017, we intend to classify operating lease income as corporate services noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement. In 2017 and prior years, this revenue was classified as other noninterest income, and these periods will be reclassified to reflect this change.

Provision for Credit Losses
Overall credit quality remained stable in 2017. The provision for credit losses was $441 million compared to $433 million in 2016. The provision for 2017 reflected loan growth, including an initial provision for the loan and lease portfolio obtained through the business acquired in the second quarter of 2017, mostly offset by lower provisions in the oil, gas and coal sectors.

Other 2,997 2,553 444 17 %
Total noninterest expense $ 10,398 $ 9,476 $ 922 10 %

Noninterest expense increased reflecting higher levels of business activity and ongoing investments in technology and business infrastructure. The increase in personnel expense also included the fourth quarter 2017 announcement of employee cash payments and pension account credits totaling $105 million. In addition, charges for real estate dispositions and exits, including data centers, totaled $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily within other noninterest expense.

Other noninterest expense for 2017 included the fourth quarter $200 million contribution of BlackRock common stock to the PNC Foundation. Contributions to the PNC Foundation in 2016 were $75 million.

During 2017, we completed actions and achieved our 2017 continuous improvement program savings goal of $350 million, which funded a significant portion of our business and technology investments, including our Retail branch strategy, enhanced digital capabilities and our home lending transformation. In 2018, we have a goal of $250 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we expect will partially fund our ongoing business and technology investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate
An income tax benefit of $1.2 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the new tax legislation and was primarily attributable to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory tax rate of 21%. As a result, the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 1.9% compared with 24.1% for 2016. Certain tax legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in this Item 7 for additional details.

The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.

Additional information regarding our effective tax rate is included in the Reconciliation of Statutory and Effective Tax Rates table in Note 17 Income Taxes in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

The summarized balance sheet data in Table 4 is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report.
Our balance sheet grew compared to December 31, 2016 and we had strong liquidity and capital positions at December 31, 2017.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total assets increased driven by strong loan growth and higher interest-earning deposits with banks;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total liabilities increased due to deposit growth and higher borrowed funds;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total equity increased due to higher retained earnings driven by net income, partially offset by common share repurchases and a decline in noncontrolling interests related to the redemption of Perpetual Trust Securities in the first quarter of 2017.

The following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet. Information regarding our capital and regulatory compliance is included in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 and in Note 18 Regulatory Matters in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Commercial loans increased $9.2 billion, or 9%, reflecting broad based growth across our lending businesses, including Corporate Banking, Business Credit and Equipment Finance within our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment.

In Corporate Banking, commercial loans increased $3.9 billion, or 8%, largely due to increased lending related to M&A activity and strong growth in middle market lending. In Business Credit, new originations and higher utilization resulted in an increase of $2.0 billion, or 14%, in the comparison.
Additionally, commercial loans and equipment lease financing loans increased as a result of new production in the Equipment Finance business, as well as the acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and leases during the second quarter of 2017.
For commercial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.
Growth in consumer lending balances was driven by higher residential real estate, automobile and credit card loans, partially offset by lower home equity and education loans.
Residential real estate loans increased as a result of growth in originations of nonconforming residential mortgage loans, both nationwide and within our branch network. Nonconforming residential mortgage loans are those with loan amounts above government agency standards for conforming loan amount limits.
Automobile loans grew in part due to continued expansion in our Southeast markets. Higher credit card balances reflected an increase in new accounts, due in part to the introduction of a new credit card product, as well as higher purchase volume. Decreases in home equity and education loans included the continued runoff in our non-strategic brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loan portfolios. The decline in home equity also reflected decreases due to paydowns and payoffs exceeding new originated volume. For information on home equity and residential real estate loans, including by geography, and automobile loans, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.

Investment securities increased $.2 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Growth in investment securities was driven by net purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $2.7 billion and U.S. Treasury and government agencies securities of $1.6 billion, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed securities of $2.2 billion, asset-backed securities of $.9 billion and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $.6 billion.

The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

Table 6 presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.

At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. If economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional other than temporary impairment (OTTI) credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.

The duration of investment securities was 3.2 years at December 31, 2017. We estimate that at December 31, 2017 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.0 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2016 for the effective duration of investment securities were 3.1 years and 2.9 years, respectively.

Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding other) was 5.2 years at December 31, 2017 compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2016.

Growth in savings deposits reflected, in part, a shift from consumer money market to relationship-based savings products. Money market deposits declined due to the shift to savings products, which was partially offset by growth of $3.5 billion in commercial interest-bearing money market deposits. Interest-bearing demand deposits reflected growth in consumer deposits of $1.7 billion and higher commercial deposits of $1.0 billion.

Growth in both bank notes and senior debt and FHLB borrowings were driven by new issuances outpacing maturities and calls. These increases were partially offset by subordinated debt maturities.

The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2017 capital and liquidity activities.

Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $47.5 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to December 31, 2016. Higher retained earnings, which reflected net income of $5.4 billion reduced by $1.5 billion of common and preferred dividends, was partially offset by common share repurchases of $2.3 billion.

Common shares outstanding were 473 million and 485 million at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, as repurchases of 18.6 million shares during 2017 were partially offset by share issuances from treasury stock related to warrants exercised and stock-based compensation activity.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments and, accordingly, have changed the basis of presentation of our segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:

- --------------
• Retail Banking

- ---------------------------------
• Corporate & Institutional Banking

- ----------------------
• Asset Management Group

- ---------
• BlackRock

Our changes in business segment presentation resulting from the realignment included the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Residential Mortgage Banking segment was combined into Retail Banking as a result of our strategic initiative to transform the home lending process by integrating mortgage and home equity lending to enhance product capability and speed of delivery for a better customer experience and to improve efficiency. In conjunction with this shift, residential mortgages previously reported within the “Other” category were also moved to Retail Banking.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment was eliminated. The segment’s remaining consumer assets were moved to the “Other” category as they are unrelated to the ongoing strategy of any segment, while its commercial assets were transferred to Corporate & Institutional Banking in order to continue the relationships we have with those customers.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A portion of business banking clients was moved from Retail Banking to Corporate & Institutional Banking to facilitate enhanced product offerings to meet the financial needs of our business banking clients.

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we made certain adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-maturity deposits based on our recent historical experience. These changes in methodology affected business segment results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset by increased net interest income in the “Other” category.

All prior periods presented were revised to conform to the new segment alignment and to our change in internal funds transfer pricing methodology.

Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 22 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 22, primarily due to the presentation in this Item 7 of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 22 presents results of businesses for 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Our business segment results reflect the allocation of the impact of the new tax legislation to our business segments, primarily the revaluation of the net deferred tax positions allocated to the segments. Certain tax legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in this Item 7 for additional details.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, certain trading activities, certain non-strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, exited businesses, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Retail Banking earned $530 million in 2017 compared with $1.0 billion in 2016. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower noninterest income, increased noninterest expense and income tax expense, which reflected the impact of new federal tax legislation, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Net interest income increased due to higher interest rate spread on the value of deposits and increases in deposit balances, partially offset by interest rate spread compression on the value of loans.

Noninterest income declined in the comparison due to negative derivative resolution. Derivative fair value adjustments relate to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date. In 2016, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, net of derivative fair value adjustments, were $32 million. Residential mortgage loan sales revenue declined as a result of lower origination volume and compressed pricing margins compared to 2016. Residential mortgage servicing rights

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  41

valuation, net of economic hedge, decreased compared with 2016 and included a $71 million negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights fair value assumption updates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher debit card, brokerage and credit card fees, net of rewards, as well as higher service charges on deposits.

Provision for credit losses increased in the comparison, reflecting loan growth and higher delinquencies in auto and credit card.

The increase in noninterest expense in the comparison primarily resulted from investments in technology and higher personnel and compliance expense.

Income taxes reflected $139 million of expense as a result of the new federal tax legislation relating to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets.

Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In 2017, average total deposits increased compared to 2016, driven by growth in savings deposits reflecting, in part, a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand deposits increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.

Retail Banking average total loans grew in 2017 compared with 2016:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average residential mortgages increased as a result of growth in originations of nonconforming residential mortgage loans, both nationwide and within our branch network.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average automobile loans increased primarily due to portfolio growth, including growth in our Southeast markets.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average credit card balances increased as a result of organic growth as we continued to focus on delivering on our long-term objective of deepening penetration within our existing customer base.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average home equity loans decreased as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume. The weighted-average updated FICO scores for this portfolio were 749 at December 31, 2017 and 746 at December 31, 2016.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2017, average loan balances for the education and other loan portfolios decreased $746 million, or 10%, compared to 2016, driven by declines in the government guaranteed education and indirect other portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.

Nonperforming assets decreased compared to December 31, 2016 due to declines in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans.

Retail Banking continued to focus on its strategy of reinventing the retail banking experience by transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network and home lending transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2017, approximately 62% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 58% for 2016.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 53% of total deposit transactions in 2017 compared with 49% for 2016.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• We had a network of 2,459 branches and 9,051 ATMs at December 31, 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 90% of the branch network as of December 31, 2017.

Retail Banking continued to make progress on its multi-year initiative to redesign the home lending process by integrating mortgage and home equity lending into a common platform to enhance product capability and improve speed of delivery and convenience.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We implemented a new mortgage origination system in the fourth quarter of 2017.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs agency guidelines.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) Includes nonperforming loans of $.5 billion and $.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $2.5 billion in 2017 compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and lower income tax expense, which reflected the impact of new federal tax legislation, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive.

Net interest income increased in the comparison, reflecting higher average loan and deposit balances as well as interest rate spread expansion on deposits.

Growth in noninterest income was primarily driven by higher capital markets-related revenue, including merger and acquisition advisory fees, loan syndication fees and underwriting fees. Additionally, operating lease income increased, mainly due to the acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and leases in the second quarter of 2017. Higher treasury management fees also contributed to the increase in noninterest income.

The decrease in provision for credit losses reflected lower provision in the oil, gas and coal sectors, partially offset by an initial provision for the loan and lease portfolio obtained through the acquired business and loan growth.

Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely driven by higher variable compensation commensurate with increased business activity, operating expenses related to the acquired business and continued investments in technology and infrastructure.

Income tax expense reflected a benefit of $373 million as a result of the new tax legislation, primarily related to revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.

Average loans increased compared with 2016 reflecting broad-based growth:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew in the comparison reflecting increased lending to large and midsized corporate clients as well as strong production in specialty lending verticals.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Higher average loans for this business were primarily due to growth in commercial mortgage and commercial loans, and to a lesser extent project loans.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased due to new originations and increased utilization, partially offset by payoffs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and finance leases, and operating leases totaled $14.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016 due to new production and the business acquired in the second quarter of 2017.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business decreased slightly primarily due to strategic risk/return considerations.

The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focus on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. In 2017, average total deposits increased compared to 2016 driven by growth in interest-bearing demand deposits reflecting in part a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits in the rising rate environment.  We continue to monitor and balance the relationship between increases in rates paid and overall profitability of our deposit balances.

In 2017, Corporate & Institutional Banking opened offices in Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis as part of a multi-year expansion of our middle market banking business. These locations complement national Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses with operations in these cities, and build on past success in markets where PNC’s retail banking presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. We plan to offer our entire suite of commercial products and services. We have also formalized plans to expand our middle market business into the Denver, Houston and Nashville markets in 2018.

Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 10 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.

Treasury management services include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services, funds transfer services, information reporting and global trade services. Treasury management revenue comprises fees from products and services and net interest income from customer deposit balances. Compared with 2016, treasury management revenue increased due to liquidity-related revenue associated with customer deposit balances, including interest rate spread expansion, and higher fee income.

Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. The increase in revenue in the comparison was broad based across most products and services and included higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher fees from loan syndications and underwriting activities.

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison as declines in commercial mortgage loan servicing income and commercial mortgage loans held for sale revenue were partially offset by a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, these amounts are only reported as discretionary assets under management. The prior period presented was adjusted to remove approximately $9 billion as of December 31, 2016 previously included in nondiscretionary assets under administration.

Asset Management Group earned $202 million in 2017 compared with $210 million in 2016. Earnings decreased as higher revenue and lower income tax expense, which reflected the impact of new federal tax legislation, was more than offset by higher noninterest expense.

The increase in revenue in the comparison was driven by higher noninterest income from asset management fees due to stronger average equity markets. This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower average home equity loan balances and interest rate spread compression on residential mortgages.

Noninterest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily attributable to higher compensation, technology and vendor-related expenses.

Asset Management Group’s strategy is focused on growing investable assets by continually evolving the client experience and products and services. The business offers an open architecture platform with a full array of investment products and banking solutions.

Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in seven of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The businesses provide customized investments, wealth planning, trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to affluent individuals and ultra-affluent families.

Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody and retirement administration services to institutional clients such as corporations, unions, municipalities, non-profits, foundations and endowments. The business also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its partnership with Corporate & Institutional Banking to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.

Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management increased compared with 2016, primarily attributable to higher equity markets as of December 31, 2017.

2016 VERSUS 2015
Consolidated Income Statement Review
Summary Results
Net income for 2016 was $4.0 billion, or $7.30 per diluted common share, a decrease of 4% compared with $4.1 billion, or $7.39 per diluted common share, for 2015. The decrease was driven by higher provision for credit losses and a 3% decline in noninterest income, partially offset by 1% increase in net interest income.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased by $113 million, or 1%, to $8.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increases in loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by an increase in borrowing costs and lower securities yields. Net interest margin was 2.73% in 2016 and 2.74% in 2015.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income decreased $176 million, or 3%, to $6.8 billion for 2016 compared to 2015. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for 2016, down from 46% for 2015.
Asset management revenue decreased $46 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to lower earnings from BlackRock and the impact from a $30 million trust settlement in 2015 in our asset management business segment. Discretionary client assets under management in the Asset Management Group were $137 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with $134 billion at December 31, 2015.
Consumer service fees increased $53 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily from growth in payment-related products including debit card and credit card, as well as higher brokerage fees.
Corporate service fees increased $13 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting higher treasury management fees and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.
Other noninterest income decreased $213 million, or 16%, to $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $1.3 billion in 2015. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and lower revenue from private equity investments. Net gains on sale of Visa shares for 2016 were $32 million compared with $166 million in 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date.

Provision For Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased to $433 million in 2016 compared with $255 million in 2015, primarily attributable to a higher provision for energy related loans in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. Overall credit portfolio performance and loan growth also contributed to the higher provision.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased slightly by $13 million to $9.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 as we continued to focus on disciplined expense management. Higher 2016 contributions to the PNC Foundation, a new FDIC deposit insurance surcharge and investments in technology and business infrastructure were offset by net lower contingency accruals.
During 2016, we completed actions and achieved our 2016 continuous improvement program savings goal of $400 million, which largely funded our investments in technology and business infrastructure.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 24.1% for 2016 compared with 24.8% for 2015. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments. The decline in the comparison reflected the tax favorability of the 2016 PNC Foundation contributions.
Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
Summary Results
Our balance sheet reflected asset growth and strong liquidity and capital positions at December 31, 2016. Total assets increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in investment securities and loan balances. Total liabilities increased in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to deposit growth. Total equity increased in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting increased retained earnings driven by net income, partially offset by share repurchases.
Loans
Loans increased $4.1 billion to $210.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015. Loan growth was driven by an increase in total commercial lending driven by higher commercial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer lending due to lower home equity and education loans.
Average total loans increased by $3.5 billion to $208.8 billion in 2016, which resulted from growth in average commercial real estate loans of $3.6 billion and average commercial loans of $2.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $2.6 billion. The decline in consumer loans was primarily attributable to lower nonstrategic consumer and government guaranteed education loan portfolios.

Investment Securities
Investment securities increased $5.4 billion to $75.9 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Growth in investment securities was driven by net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by prepayments of non-agency commercial mortgage-backed and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.
Average investment securities increased to $72.0 billion during 2016 compared to $61.7 billion during 2015, primarily due to increases in average agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by a decrease in average non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.
The weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding other) was 5.0 years at December 31, 2016 and 4.8 years at December 31, 2015.
Funding Sources
Total deposits increased $8.2 billion to $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015, due to strong growth in demand and savings deposits which reflected in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products.
Average total deposits increased $10.5 billion to $250.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, which reflected higher average savings deposits and higher average interest-bearing demand deposits.
Total borrowed funds decreased $1.8 billion to $52.7 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 as maturities of FHLB borrowings were partially offset by higher bank notes and senior debt.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity grew $1.0 billion to $45.7 billion at December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher retained earnings and capital surplus, which included the issuance of Series S preferred stock, partially offset by common share repurchases of $2.0 billion and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to net unrealized securities losses. The growth in retained earnings resulted from 2016 net income of $4.0 billion, reduced by $1.3 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares outstanding were 485 million and 504 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting repurchases of 22.8 million shares during 2016.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Enterprise Risk Management
We encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly, we design risk management processes to help manage this risk. We manage risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers and communities.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework is structurally aligned with enhanced prudential standards that establish minimum requirements for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework. This Risk Management section describes our ERM Framework which consists of risk culture, enterprise strategy (including risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. The overall Risk Management section of this Item 7 also provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within this Risk Management section.
We operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption of regulatory pronouncements within our ERM Framework.
We view risk management as a cohesive combination of the following risk elements which form our ERM Framework:

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  49

Risk Culture
A strong risk culture helps us make well-informed decisions, ensures individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an individual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards employees working toward a common goal rather than individual interests. Our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. These protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.
Managing risk is every one of our employee’s responsibility. All of our employees individually and collectively assume responsibility for ensuring the organization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives rather than pursuing individual interests. All employees are responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and how risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities. Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.
Proactive communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. Our multi-level risk committee structure provides a formal channel to identify and report risk.
Enterprise Strategy
We ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing processes. These components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors.
Risk Appetite: Our risk appetite represents the organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively describes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies. Qualitative guiding principles further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and limits, including forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our risk appetite metrics reflect material risks, align with our established Risk Appetite Framework, balance risk and reward, leverage analytics, and adjust in a timely manner to changes in the external and internal risk environments.
Strategic Planning: Our enterprise and line of business strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies and goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with

all capital, risk appetite and liquidity targets and guidelines. Our CEO and CFO lead the development of the strategic plan, the strategic objectives and the comprehensive identification of material risks that could hinder successful implementation and execution of strategies. Strategic planning is linked to our risk management and capital planning processes.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing: Capital planning helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound operations and viability. The capital planning process and the resulting capital plan evolve as our overall risks, activities and risk management practices change. Capital planning aligns with our strategic planning process.

Stress testing is an essential element of the capital planning process. Effective stress testing enables us to consider the estimated effect on capital of various hypothetical scenarios.
Risk Governance and Framework
We employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this risk governance and oversight framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the Board of Directors, executive, corporate and business levels. Committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the OCC’s heightened risk management and governance expectations and guidelines. See discussion of the enhanced prudential standards in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report.
To ensure the appropriate risks are being taken and effectively managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of defense. The Board of Directors’ and each line of defense’s responsibilities are detailed below:
Board of Directors – The Board of Directors oversees our risk-taking activities and is responsible for exercising sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.
First line of defense – The front line units are accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the risk management framework established by the Independent Risk Management department. Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes within their areas. Integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks which may significantly impact each business.
Second line of defense – The second line of defense is independent from the first line of defense and is responsible for establishing the standards for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate risks. As the second line of defense, the independent risk areas monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense,

50    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, and report any issues or exceptions. The risk areas help to ensure the first line of defense is properly designed and operating as intended, and they may intervene directly in modifying and developing first line of defense risk processes and controls.
Third line of defense – As the third line of defense, Internal Audit is independent from the first and second lines of defense. Internal Audit provides the Board of Directors and executive management comprehensive assurance on the effectiveness of risk management practices across the organization.
Within the three lines of defense, the independent risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. Our business oversight and decision-making is supported through a governance structure at the Board of Directors and management level. Specific responsibilities include:
Board of Directors – Our Board of Directors oversees our business and affairs as managed by our officers and employees. The Board of Directors may receive assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through the following standing committees:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Audit Committee: monitors the integrity of our consolidated financial statements; monitors internal control over financial reporting; monitors compliance with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance of our Internal Audit function and our independent auditors.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Nominating and Governance Committee: oversees the implementation of sound corporate governance principles and practices while promoting our best interests and those of our shareholders

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Personnel and Compensation Committee: oversees the compensation of our executive officers and other specified responsibilities related to personnel compensation matters affecting us.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Risk Committee: oversees enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage the organization’s risks and evaluates and approves our risk governance framework. The Risk Committee has formed a Technology Subcommittee and a Compliance Subcommittee to facilitate Board-level oversight of risk management in these areas.

Corporate Committees – The corporate committees are responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, recommending risk limits, policies and metrics, monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key risk issues, and approving significant transactions and initiatives. We have established several senior management-level corporate committees to facilitate the review, evaluation and management of risk. The management-level Executive Committee is the corporate committee that is responsible for developing enterprise-wide strategy and achieving our strategic objectives. The Executive Committee evaluates risk management, in part, by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate committees which are the supporting committees for the Executive Committee.
Working Committees – The working committees are generally subcommittees of the corporate committees. Working committees are intended to assist in the implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a business or function; recommend and/or approve risk
appetite metrics and limits; recommend and/or approve policies that are generally within the standards outlined in the applicable enterprise policy; and review and/or approve certain significant transactions or initiatives.

Policies and Procedures – We have established risk management policies and procedures to provide direction, guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of Directors. These policies and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees within the governance structure.
We have established risk management policies, programs and procedures to support our ERM Framework, articulate our risk culture, define the parameters and processes within which employees are to manage risk and conduct our business activities and to provide direction, guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of Directors. These policies, programs and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees within the governance structure.

Risk Identification
Risk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. These risk types consist of, but are not limited to, credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. These risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against the risk appetite. Multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including Risk Appetite Metrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance Indicators, Risk Control and Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, stress testing and special investigations.
Risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or businesses. The aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the Risk Appetite Framework and approved by the Board of Directors or by appropriate committees. This enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.
Risk Assessment
Once risks are identified, they are evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they are material. Risk assessments support the overall management of an effective ERM Framework and allow us to control and monitor our actual risk level through the use of risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and timely assessments of risk are essential to an effective ERM Framework. Effective risk measurement practices will uncover reoccurring risks that have been experienced in the past; make the known risks easy to see, understand, compare and report; and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to understand or predict.

Risk Controls and Monitoring
Our ERM Framework consists of policies, processes, personnel and control systems. Risk controls and limits provide the linkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and associated guiding principles to the risk taking activities of our businesses. In addition to risk appetite limits, a system of more detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors our various processes and functions. These control systems measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, ensure information is accurate and reliable, and document compliance with laws and regulations.
Our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls provides assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective and also results in the identification of control improvement recommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily, on-going process used by both the first and second line of defense to ensure compliance with our ERM Framework. Risk monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including performing risk assessments at the prime process and risk assessment unit level, monitoring an area’s key controls, the timely reporting of issues, and establishing a quality assurance and/or quality control function, as applicable.
Risk Aggregation and Reporting
Risk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) aggregate risks; (ii) identify concentrations; (iii) help ensure we remain within our established risk appetite; (iv) serve as a basis for monitoring our risk profile in relation to our risk appetite and (v) communicate risks to the Board of Directors and executive management.
Risk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and enterprise levels. The enterprise level risk report aggregates risks identified in the functional and business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. The enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk and represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite. The determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation of our risk profile enables a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative risk appetite. The enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the Board of Directors.

Each individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, risk appetite, and risk outlook. The enterprise level risk report includes an aggregate view of risks identified in the individual report and provides a summary of our overall risk profile compared to our risk appetite.

Credit Risk Management
Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis

Table 13: Details of Loans
Dollars in billions

We use several asset quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Asset Quality, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about our significant loan classes.

Commercial
Commercial loans comprised 50% and 48% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Most of our commercial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other business assets.

We actively manage our commercial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level
of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to continual monitoring of the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography

that may exist in our portfolio. Our portfolio remains stable and well-diversified as evidenced by the following table which provides a breakout of our commercial loans by industry classification (classified based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)).

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $15.3 billion of real estate project loans and $13.7 billion related to commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2017. Comparable amounts were $16.3 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S. The following table presents our commercial real estate loans by geographic market.

Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $16.8 billion of primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $11.6 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at December 31, 2017. Comparable amounts were $17.7 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original loan-to-value ratios (LTV), updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and

bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.

The portfolio is primarily originated within our primary geographic markets, with only 5% of the portfolio in states outside of those markets as of December 31, 2017. The credit quality of newly originated loans in 2017 was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted- average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO score of 776.

The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

The following table presents our home equity loans by geographic market and lien type.

Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similar to home equity loans. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., FHA, conforming, etc.). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.

The credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet in 2017 was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 71% and a weighted-average FICO score of 768.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to government agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate residential mortgage loans above the conforming loan amount limits, known as nonconforming mortgage loans, which we retain on our balance sheet. In recent years, including in 2017, we have increased the volume of nonconforming loans that we originate, including in California.

The following presents our residential real estate loans by geographic market.

Automobile
Within auto loans, $11.4 billion resided in the indirect auto portfolio, $1.4 billion in the direct auto portfolio and $.1 billion in securitized portfolios as of December 31, 2017. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2016 were $10.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $.3 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio relates to loan applications generated from franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.

We continue to focus on a strong origination profile as evidenced by a weighted-average loan origination FICO score during 2017 of 745 for indirect auto loans and 767 for direct auto loans. The weighted-average term of loan originations during 2017 was 72 months for indirect auto loans and 62 months for direct auto loans. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. The portfolio was composed of 54% new vehicle loans and 46% used vehicle loans at December 31, 2017.

The auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 18. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of December 31, 2017, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 62% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).

Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 75% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017, up from 70% at December 31, 2016. Home equity TDRs comprise 50% of home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017
and 52% at December 31, 2016. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six
consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

At December 31, 2017, our largest nonperforming asset was $44 million in the Wholesale Trade industry. The ten largest individual nonperforming assets represented 12% of total nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2017.
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 driven by declines in government insured residential real estate, and government insured education loans within other consumer. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.

Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings

Consumer Loan Modifications
We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs.

A temporary modification, with a term up to 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.

We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers’ and servicing customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 21 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

Total consumer real estate related loan modifications 26,303 $ 2,798 27,388 $ 2,951

Commercial Loan Modifications
Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming
prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g. a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
Reserves are established for non-impaired commercial loan classes based primarily on PD and LGD.
Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.
Allowances for non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon transition matrices, including using a roll-rate model. The roll-rate model uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.
We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.

A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- ---------------------------------------
• Industry concentrations and conditions,

- -----------------------------
• Recent credit quality trends,

- ------------------------------------------------
• Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,

- ------------------------------
• Recent macro-economic factors,

- ------------------
• Model imprecision,

- -------------------------------------------
• Changes in lending policies and procedures,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and

- -----------------------------------------
• Limitations of available historical data.

Our determination of the ALLL for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. There are several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the ALLL. This sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. It is intended to provide insight into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given the current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.
In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL.

In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.

At December 31, 2017, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 140%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2016 was 121%. These ratios are 102% and 89%, respectively, when excluding the $.7 billion of ALLL at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded these amounts from ALLL in these ratios as these asset classes are not included in nonperforming loans. See Table 18 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.

The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During 2017, overall credit quality remained stable, which resulted in an essentially flat ALLL balance as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.
Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. Liquidity-related risk limits are established within our Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy and supporting policies. Management committees, including the Asset and Liability Committee, and the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.
In addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above, we also monitor our liquidity by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which is further described in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a daily basis and as of December 31, 2017, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the fully phased-in requirement of 100%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $265.1 billion at December 31, 2017 from $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016, driven by higher consumer and commercial deposits. Consumer deposits reflected in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Commercial deposits reflected a shift from demand deposits to money market deposits primarily due to higher interest rates in 2017. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.

At December 31, 2017, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $33.0 billion and securities available for sale totaling $57.6 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $90.6 billion, we had $3.2 billion of
securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $4.9 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.
We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See Note 10 Borrowed Funds and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Report for additional information related to our Borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At December 31, 2017, PNC Bank had $26.7 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $23.1 billion were senior bank notes and $3.6 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended December 31, 2017:

Issuance Date Amount Description of Issuance
October 23, 2017 $1 billion Senior notes with a maturity date of October 25, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.100% on April 25 and October 25 of each year, beginning April 25, 2018.
October 23, 2017 $750 million Senior notes with a maturity date of November 5, 2020. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.450% on May 5 and November 5 of each year, beginning November 5, 2017. Following the re-opening, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of this series of notes initially issued on November 3, 2015 increased to $1.5 billion.

See Note 23 Subsequent Events for information on the January 2018 issuances of $900 million and $700 million of senior fixed rate notes and $400 million of senior floating rate notes by PNC Bank.

PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine
business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At December 31, 2017, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $41.0 billion.

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.

Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2017, available parent company liquidity totaled $5.7 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:

- -------------------------
• Bank-level capital needs,

- ---------------------
• Laws and regulations,

- -------------------
• Corporate policies,

- -----------------------------
• Contractual restrictions, and

- --------------
• Other factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, there was $.1 billion of commercial paper issuances outstanding.

The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments.

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016.

Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. In addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
For the full year 2017, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders. Repurchases totaled 18.6 million common shares for $2.3 billion and dividends on common shares were $1.3 billion.
We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under share repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors
in the amount of up to 100 million shares and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal Reserve. Repurchases are made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and the extent and timing of share repurchases under authorizations depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR and DFAST processes.

In relation to the 2016 capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017, including repurchases of up to $.2 billion related to employee benefit plans. In January 2017, we announced a $.3 billion increase in our share repurchase programs for the four quarter period. For the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased 21.5 million shares of PNC common stock for $2.3 billion. Of the total repurchased, 10.7 million shares for $1.3 billion occurred in the first two quarters of 2017.
In connection with the 2017 CCAR process, the Federal Reserve accepted our capital plan, as approved by our Board of Directors, and did not object to our proposed capital actions in June 2017. As provided for in the 2017 capital plan, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.7 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion related to employee benefit plans. We repurchased 7.9 million common shares for $1.1 billion during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 under these share repurchase programs.
The quarterly cash dividend on common stock was increased to 75 cents from 55 cents effective with the August 5, 2017 dividend payment date.
See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in this Report for further information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.

For detailed information on regulatory capital requirements, see the Banking Regulation and Supervision portion of the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business.

We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for 2017 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2017 Transitional Basel III ratios.
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our December 31, 2017 capital levels were aligned with them.
At December 31, 2017, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report for details on our December 31, 2016 Transitional Basel III and Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratios.
Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.

We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 follow:

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

Second year sensitivity 1.8 % .4 % (3.8 )%

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.
When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 31 and 32. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.

The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.
Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward

The fourth quarter 2017 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.

We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2017 and 2016 were within our acceptable limits.
To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is a good predictor of future variability. Actual observations include customer related revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day VaR measure. There were one and two instances during 2017 and 2016, respectively, under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure and those losses were insignificant. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR models utilize a historical approach with a 500 day look back period.
Customer-related trading revenue was $255 million for full year 2017 compared with $203 million for full year 2016 and is recorded in Other noninterest income and Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities and higher foreign exchange client sales revenues.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.

Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

BlackRock
We owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at December 31, 2017, accounted for under the equity method. The Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes additional information about BlackRock.
Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated
entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $.8 billion and $.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on Tax Credit Investments.
Private Equity and Other
The majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. See Item 1 Business –Supervision and Regulation of this Report for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule, including the five-year extension we received in February 2017 to conform certain equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule.
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. At December 31, 2017, the estimated value of our investment in Visa Class B common shares was approximately $661 million and our cost basis was not significant. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of the pending interchange litigation. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a negative derivative fair value adjustment of $248 million related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa Class B common shares. These fair value adjustments were primarily related to the extension of anticipated timing of litigation resolution.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant during 2017 and 2016.
Impact of Inflation
Our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. Should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates.

Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest rate swaps, options and future contracts. Premiums are also exchanged for options contracts. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 6 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.
Operational risk management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: 1) identified and assessed; 2) managed through the design and implementation of controls; 3) measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and 4) appropriately reported to management and the Risk Committee. Strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the customer experience, enhancing compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses, and establishing an appropriate amount of required operational risk capital held by us.
The Operational Risk Management Framework supports our effective and consistent management of operational risk. The primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and manage them to the desired risk profile, in line with our Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance established within the framework enables management to make well-informed risk-based business decisions.
The framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains. These domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.
The operational risk domains are:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or fraud.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory standards, or other regulatory requirements.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• Data Management: Risk associated with incomplete or inaccurate data.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Model: Risk associated with the design, implementation, and ongoing use and management of a model.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Technology and Systems: Risk associated with the use, operation, and adoption of technology.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Information Security: Risk resulting from the failure to protect information and ensure appropriate access to, and use and handling of information assets.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Business Continuity: Risk of potential disruptive events to business activities.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Third Party: Risk arising from failure of third party providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws and regulations.

We utilize operational risk management programs within the framework, including Risk Control and Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event review and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. The program tools and methodology enable our business managers to identify potential risks and control gaps.

Lines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, managing, and monitoring the operational risks and controls associated with its business activities and product or service offerings to within acceptable levels. Centralized functions, such as Business Continuity, Enterprise Third Party Management, and Information Security, are responsible for the development, implementation and management of their individual programs and for the development and maintenance of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools, and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor, and report program risks. Additionally, independent risk management reviews and challenges line of business adherence to the framework to ensure proper controls are in place and appropriate risk mitigation plans are established as necessary.

Compliance Risk
Enterprise Compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of our Operational Risk Management Framework. Compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and tracking programs. Key compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of our operational risk profile. A committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk management programs across PNC. In order to help understand and proactively address emerging regulatory issues where appropriate, Enterprise Compliance communicates regularly with various regulators having supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.
Fair Value Measurements
We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party

information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
We apply ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurements. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable.

The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities 1 % 2 %
Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value 13 % 9 %
Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities %

The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights. The decline in Level 3 assets was driven by the transfer of certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale to Level 2 and settlements related to residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale during the period. For further information on fair value, see Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other

relevant factors. These critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:

- ----------------------------
• Probability of default (PD),

- -------------------------
• Loss given default (LGD),

- --------------------------------
• Outstanding balance of the loan,

- ------------------------------------
• Movement through delinquency stages,

- -------------------------------------------------
• Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  69

For all loans, the ALLL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. For unfunded commitments, the reserve estimate also includes estimation of the probability of funding. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information:

Goodwill
Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses.
The value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by our invested assets and transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings and realized profitability resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. For this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount (“Step 1” of the goodwill impairment test) as further discussed below. The fair values of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions based upon market comparables. Additionally, we may also evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative of fair value, including market quotes, price to earnings ratios and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting unit’s

goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. In this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, which is determined as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill (“Step 2” of the goodwill impairment test). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
The results of our annual 2017 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by at least 10% and are not considered to be at risk of not passing Step 1. By definition, assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a significant change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to decrease below their respective carrying values. Similarly, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2016 or 2015.
See Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights
We elect to measure our residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of residential and commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.
We employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. The values of the residential and commercial MSRs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs.

Income Taxes
In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations.
We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter.
Where our accounting of certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 is complete, these tax effects have been included in the financial statements. However, to the extent our accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but can be reasonably estimated, the estimated effects are included as provisional amounts in the financial statements. During the measurement period, which will end on December 21, 2018, these estimates may be adjusted upon obtaining or analyzing additional information about facts and circumstances or clarification of uncertain aspects of the newly enacted tax law. If known, the adjustments would have affected the initially reported provisional amounts.
Legal Contingencies
For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing reserves for legal contingencies, see Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. The ASU requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. The impact of adoption was immaterial to PNC's consolidated results of operations and financial position. The most significant impact of adoption will be expanded disclosures relating to disaggregation of in-scope revenue, which will be included in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q.
Financial Instruments
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. For an equity investment which does not have a readily determinable fair value, an election can be made to measure the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in identical or similar instruments of the issuer. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value is not readily determinable.
We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which is applied prospectively. The impact of adoption was immaterial to PNC's consolidated results of operations and financial position.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The primary change in the new guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  71

modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted.
Our implementation efforts are ongoing, including the deployment of a lease accounting software solution. We are currently evaluating the impact of various accounting policy elections, the discount rate to present value the future minimum payments under operating leases, and the impact of new disclosure requirements. We are substantially complete with the evaluation of our initial lease population. We expect, at a minimum, to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets commensurate with the present value of the future minimum payments required under operating leases as disclosed in Note 8 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. We do not expect a material change to the timing of our expense recognition.
Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, current expected credit losses (CECL) for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. The CECL methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope of the ASU will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets. Enhanced credit quality disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. The ASU is effective for us for the first quarter of 2020 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We do not plan to adopt the standard at its early adoption date in the first quarter of 2019.
The CECL methodology and new disclosures requires significant data collection, building or enhancement of loss models, and process re-development prior to adoption. We established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure in the third quarter of 2016, which oversees overall strategy for implementation of Topic 326, including model methodology, technology, development, data enhancements and governance issues. We continue to design and develop CECL estimation methodologies and technological solutions. Concurrently, we are assessing and analyzing whether data that is required to comply with the standard is available and accurate.
We continue to believe that the adoption of the standard will result in an overall increase in the allowance for loan losses to cover credit losses over the estimated life of the financial assets. However, the magnitude of the increase in our allowance for loan losses at the adoption date will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the

adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date.
Statement of Cash Flows
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The ASU provides guidance on eight specific issues related to classification within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. The specific issues cover cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; cash outflows for settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant; contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests received in securitization transactions; and clarifies that when no specific GAAP guidance exists and the source of the cash flows are not separately identifiable, then the predominant source of cash flows should be used to determine the classification for the item. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2018 under the retrospective transition method. The impact of adoption was immaterial to our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Derivatives and Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The ASU simplifies the application of hedge accounting by easing the requirements for effectiveness testing, hedge documentation and the application of critical terms match method. The ASU also provides new alternatives for applying hedge accounting to additional hedging strategies and measuring the hedged item in fair value hedges of interest rate risk.

The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. All transition requirements and elections should be applied to hedging relationships existing on the date of adoption and the effect of adoption is required to be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (i.e. modified retrospective application) through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. One-time transition elections are available to modify existing hedge documentation.

We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2017-12 recognized at the date of initial application. The impact of adoption was immaterial to PNC's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Comprehensive Income
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU permits the reclassification to retained earnings of the income tax effects stranded within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This standard requires qualitative disclosures of the accounting policy relating to releasing income tax effects from AOCI and if the reclassification election is made, the impacts of the change on the financial statements. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 and have elected to reclassify the income tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. The impact of adoption was immaterial to PNC’s consolidated balance sheet.

Significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, must then be deducted to the extent such items individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of our adjusted Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital .

Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio – Common equity Tier 1 capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).

Basel III Tier 1 capital – Common equity Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying preferred stock, plus certain trust preferred capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others and plus/less other adjustments.

Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio – Tier 1 capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).

Basel III Total capital – Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt, plus certain trust preferred securities, plus, under the Basel III transitional rules and the standardized approach, the allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital and other.

Charge-off – Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred from portfolio holdings to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is less than carrying amount.

Combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) – This is the aggregate principal balance(s) of the mortgages on a property divided by its appraised value or purchase price.

Common shareholders’ equity – Total shareholders’ equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.

Credit valuation adjustment – Represents an adjustment to the fair value of our derivatives for our own and counterparties’ non-performance risk.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  73

Criticized commercial loans – Loans with potential or identified weaknesses based upon internal risk ratings that comply with the regulatory classification definitions of “Special Mention,” “Substandard” or “Doubtful.”

Discretionary client assets under management – Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Duration of equity – An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is -1.5 years, the economic value of equity increases by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.

Earning assets – Assets that generate income, which include: interest-earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets.

Effective duration – A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.

Efficiency – Noninterest expense divided by total revenue.

Fair value – The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Fee income – When referring to the components of Noninterest income, we use the term fee income to refer to the following categories within Noninterest income: Asset management; Consumer services; Corporate services; Residential mortgage; and Service charges on deposits.

FICO score – A credit bureau-based industry standard score created by Fair Isaac Co. which predicts the likelihood of borrower default. We use FICO scores both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. Lower FICO scores indicate likely higher risk of default, while higher FICO scores indicate likely lower risk of default. FICO scores are updated on a periodic basis.

Foreign exchange contracts – Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms.

Futures and forward contracts – Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.

GAAP – Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Home price index (HPI) – A broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices in the U.S.

Impaired loans – Loans are determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogenous type loans and purchased impaired loans.

Interest rate swap contracts – Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Intrinsic value – The difference between the price, if any, required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock.

Leverage ratio – Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.

LIBOR – Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Our product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a benchmark.

Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) – A calculation of a loan’s collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same collateral. Market values of the collateral are based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For example, a LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than a LTV of greater than or equal to 90%.

Loss given default (LGD) – An estimate of loss, net of recovery based on collateral type, collateral value, loan exposure, and other factors. Each loan has its own LGD. The LGD risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default occurs. LGD is net of recovery, through any means, including but not limited to the liquidation of collateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings.

Nonaccrual loans – Loans for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonaccrual loans include nonperforming loans, in addition to loans accounted for under fair value option and loans accounted for as held for sale for which full collection of contractual principal and/or interest is not probable.

74    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Nondiscretionary client assets under administration – Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Nonperforming assets – Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and OREO, foreclosed and other assets, but exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans – Loans accounted for at amortized cost for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer customers as well as TDRs which have not returned to performing status. Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming loans exclude purchased impaired loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.

Notional amount – A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivative contract.

Operating leverage – The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage).

Options – Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future.

Other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets –Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. Foreclosed and other assets include real and personal property, equity interests in corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. Excludes certain assets that have a government guarantee which are classified as other receivables.

Probability of default (PD) – An internal risk rating that indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status.

Recovery – Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Risk – The potential that an event or series of events could occur that would threaten our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, thereby negatively affecting shareholder value or reputation.

Risk appetite – A dynamic, forward-looking view on the aggregate amount of risk we are willing and able to take in executing business strategy in light of the current business environment.

Risk limits – Quantitative measures based on forward looking assumptions that allocate the firm’s aggregate risk appetite (e.g. measure of loss or negative events) to business lines, legal entities, specific risk categories, concentrations and as appropriate, other levels.

Risk profile – The risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of risk. The profile represents overall risk position in relation to the desired risk appetite. The determination of the risk profile’s position is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines and qualitative assessments.

Risk-weighted assets – Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.

Servicing rights – An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.

Taxable-equivalent interest income – The interest income earned on certain assets that is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. These tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital – Common equity Tier 1 capital calculated under Basel III using phased-in definitions and deductions applicable to us during the related presentation period and standardized approach risk-weighted assets.

Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) – A loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  75

Value-at-risk (VaR) – A statistically-based measure of risk that describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 days for a 95% VaR.

Yield curve – A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a “normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An “inverted” or “negative” yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.

- -----------------------------------------------------
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Changes in customer behavior due to newly enacted tax legislation, changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.

- -----------------------------------------------------------
– Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.

- ---------------------------
– Commodity price volatility.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economic growth will accelerate somewhat in 2018, in light of stimulus from recently passed corporate and personal income tax cuts that are expected to support business investment and consumer spending, respectively. Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year, including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for consumer spending. Other sources of growth for the U.S. economy in 2018 will be the global economic expansion and the housing market. Although inflation slowed in 2017, it should pick up as the labor market continues to tighten. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise throughout 2018; our baseline forecast is for three increases in the federal funds rate in 2018, pushing the rate to a range of 2.00 to 2.25 percent by the end of the year. Longer-term rates are also expected to increase as the Federal Reserve slowly reduces the size of its balance sheet and the federal government borrows more, but at a slower pace than the short-term rates, so we anticipate the yield curve will flatten but not invert.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention,

76    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel Committee.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this Report, and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of December 31, 2017, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 62% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).

Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 75% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017, up from 70% at December 31, 2016. Home equity TDRs comprise 50% of home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017
and 52% at December 31, 2016. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six
consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

At December 31, 2017, our largest nonperforming asset was $44 million in the Wholesale Trade industry. The ten largest individual nonperforming assets represented 12% of total nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2017.

Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings

Consumer Loan Modifications
We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. terms may be classified as TDRs.

A temporary modification, with a term up to 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.

We also monitor the success rates of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

Total consumer real estate related loan modifications 26,303 $ 2,798 27,388 $ 2,951

Commercial Loan Modifications
Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming
prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured (e.g. a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
We Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
Reserves are established for non-impaired commercial loan classes based primarily on PD and LGD.
Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.
Allowances for non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon transition matrices, including using a roll-rate model. 
 value of the underlying collateral.

A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- ---------------------------------------
• Industry concentrations and conditions,

- -----------------------------
• Recent credit quality trends,

- ------------------------------------------------
• Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,

- ------------------------------
• Recent macro-economic factors,

- ------------------
• Model imprecision,

- -------------------------------------------
• Changes in lending policies and procedures,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and

- -----------------------------------------
• Limitations of available historical data.

Our determination of the ALLL for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. There are current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.
In determining the incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL.

In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.
Management key established limits.
In addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above, we also monitor our liquidity by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which is further described in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a daily basis and as of December 31, 2017, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the fully phased-in requirement of 100%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $265.1 billion at December 31, 2017 from $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016, driven by higher consumer and commercial deposits. 

At December 31, 2017, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $33.0 billion and securities available for sale totaling $57.6 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $90.6 billion, we had $3.2 billion of
securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $4.9 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.
We also obtain liquidity through various forms See Note 10 Borrowed Funds and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Report for additional information related to our Borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At December 31, 2017, PNC Bank had $26.7 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $23.1 billion were senior bank notes and $3.6 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended December 31, 2017:

Table 26: PNC Bank Notes Issued During Fourth Quarter 2017

Issuance Date Amount Description of Issuance
October 23, 2017 $1 billion Senior notes with a maturity date of October 25, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.100% on April 25 and October 25 of each year, beginning April 25, 2018.
October 23, 2017 $750 million Senior notes with a maturity date of November 5, 2020. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.450% to $1.5 billion.

See Note 23 Subsequent Events for information on the January 2018 issuances of $900 million and $700 million of senior fixed rate notes and $400 million of senior floating rate notes by PNC Bank.

PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine
business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At December 31, 2017, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $41.0 billion.

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.

Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2017, available parent company liquidity totaled $5.7 billion. be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:

- -------------------------
• Bank-level capital needs,

- ---------------------
• Laws and regulations,

- -------------------
• Corporate policies,

- -----------------------------
• Contractual restrictions, and

• Other factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends this Report for a further discussion of these limitations.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, there was $.1 billion of commercial paper issuances outstanding.

The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments.

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016.

Capital Management
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
For the full year 2017, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders. Repurchases totaled 18.6 million common shares for $2.3 billion and dividends on common shares were $1.3 billion.
We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under share repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors
in the amount of up to 100 million shares and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal Reserve. Repurchases are made on the open market of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR and DFAST processes.

In relation to the 2016 capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve, we announced a $.3 billion increase in our share repurchase programs for the four quarter period. For the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased 21.5 million shares of PNC common stock for $2.3 billion. Of the total repurchased, 10.7 million shares for $1.3 billion occurred in the first two quarters of 2017.
In connection with the 2017 CCAR process, the Federal Reserve accepted our capital plan, as approved by our Board of Directors, and did not object to our proposed capital actions in June 2017. As provided for in the 2017 capital plan, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.7 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion related to employee benefit plans. We repurchased 7.9 million common shares for $1.1 billion during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 under these share repurchase programs.
The quarterly cash dividend on common stock was increased to 75 cents from 55 cents effective with the August 5, 2017 dividend payment date.
See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in this Report for further information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.
