ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS
This Form 10-K presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Company and for presentations of Company performance to investors. The Company further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.
The following are the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-K and a discussion of why management uses these non-GAAP measures:
Return on Average Tangible Common Equity – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “average tangible common equity.” Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the Company’s use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.
Tangible Equity Ratio, Tangible Common Equity Ratio, and Tangible Book Value per Common Share – this schedule also includes “tangible equity,” “tangible common equity,” and “tangible assets.” Tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provides additional useful information about the levels of tangible assets and tangible equity between each other and in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.
Efficiency Ratio – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” “pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”) ,” and “adjusted PPNR.” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedule which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Company is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio and adjusted noninterest expense are the key metrics to which the Company announced it would hold itself accountable in its June 1, 2015 efficiency initiative, and to which executive compensation is tied.

Company Overview
Zions Bancorporation (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Company,” “Zions,” “we,” “our,” “us”) together comprise a $66 billion financial holding company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• As of December 31, 2017, the Company was the 19th largest domestic bank holding company in terms of deposits and is included in the Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ Financial 100 indices.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• At December 31, 2017, the Company had banking operations through 433 domestic branches in eleven western states. Additionally, the Company currently has, and continues to develop its digital delivery capabilities. Revenues and profits are primarily derived from commercial customers and the Company also emphasizes mortgage banking, wealth management, municipal finance, and brokerage services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company is consistently ranked among the best banks in the country to work with by its small and middle-market customers, as measured by the Greenwich Associates annual survey. Since the awards inception in 2009, only three other U.S. banks have consistently received as many Greenwich Excellence Awards as Zions Bancorporation.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company consistently wins awards for the best bank within its geography. Examples include the best bank awards given by local newspapers, business journals, or similar publications in Nevada, Arizona, and California: Orange County (four consecutive years) and San Diego County (seven consecutive years).

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The long-term strategy of the Company is driven by key factors that include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Continuing to execute on our community bank business model by doing business on a “local” basis, with significant local decision making for customer-facing elements of our business including product offerings, marketing, and pricing. We believe this provides a meaningful competitive advantage and an opportunity for growth over larger national banks whose loan and deposit products are often homogeneous. We are actively

31

Table of Contents

engaged in community events and charitable efforts designed to give back to the people within our communities. In 2017, we believe this local, customized approach led to a strong showing with commercial customers as reflected in the Greenwich Awards referenced earlier, as well as a growth rate of loans that exceeded the domestic commercial banks’ rate by approximately three percentage points.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Achieving even greater efficiencies than currently reflected in our financial statements. We have improved the financial performance of the Company significantly during the past three years and we intend to continue to do so by creating value through the adoption of common practices, automation, and simplification of all of our front, middle and back-office processes.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ We expect to achieve continued growth of revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) in excess of noninterest expense—so-called positive operating leverage—which should result in annual PPNR growth in the high single digit rate and further improvement to the efficiency ratio.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Improving profitability ratios. Improved operating efficiency coupled with low credit costs as experienced in 2017 should lead to improved profitability ratios, such as the return on assets and equity. We expect to maintain or increase the return of shareholders’ equity due to stronger earnings and a lower risk profile than seen in stress testing results just a few years ago.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Maintaining a strong approach to risk management, having meaningfully improved our operational, credit, and financial risk management in the past several years.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Striving to be a “top employer of choice,” which means employees view Zions Bancorporation as one of the best places to work and grow.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We believe our scale gives us superior access to capital markets, more robust treasury management, and other product capabilities than smaller community banks. Looking forward for the next several years, we believe that digital delivery of products, including mobile banking, online banking and having a core processing system that is robust and prevents outages, is critical to remaining competitive. As such, we are investing a substantial amount to upgrade and replace systems and applications.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the past several years we have taken significant actions to improve the Company’s risk profile, which include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The reduction of an above-average concentration in CRE commitments, and within CRE, the concentration of land development commitments declined from more than 70% of total risk-based capital in 2007, to less than 5% at December 31, 2017;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Numerous changes made to the credit administration organization and processes to facilitate improved data collection on loans and monitoring of potential default and loss risk;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The higher-risk portfolio of collateralized debt obligation securities were sold and replaced with government and government agency securities;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A significant increase in the on-balance sheet storehouse of liquidity with the purchase of moderate duration securities with limited duration extension risk; i.e., management has generally purchased securities that within the context of a rising interest rate environment would not experience interest rate related losses;

- -------------------------------------------------------
◦ The addition of five members of the Board of Directors;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The replacement and upgrade of management information and accounting systems to allow for a more complete view of the Company’s risks and opportunities;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The ongoing evaluation and classification of all known risks into approximately sixty unique risk categories, which are regularly monitored and reported in a process that flows from line-level employees through executive management to the Board of Directors;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The streamlining or elimination of redundant or inefficient processes, and the reduction of unnecessary complexity in product types;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• With the improvement in the risk profile, along with improving profitability, the Company’s capital stress test results have markedly improved within the past few years, and as such, we have increased the return of capital to shareholders including increasing the common dividend from $0.16 per share in 2014 to $0.44 per share in 2017. Additionally, we repurchased $320 million of common stock during 2017. We believe we are carrying

excess capital, informed primarily by our stress test results, and have indicated that we intend to increase the leverage of the Company at a gradual pace as a result of moderate loan growth combined with total payout ratios generally similar to the current capital plan.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• As part of our ongoing simplification and efficiency efforts, in December 2015, the Company consolidated its various banking charters into a single charter. Additionally, as previously discussed, in November 2017, the Company announced plans to change its structure to consolidate the holding company into the banking entity. This change, if approved by shareholders and regulators, will further reduce duplication of effort and simplify operations. For more information see, “Regulatory relief if proposed restructuring is completed and FSOC application is approved,” on page 15.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Summary
The Company reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for 2017 of $550 million or $2.60 per diluted common share compared with $411 million or $1.99 per diluted common share for 2016. The improved financial performance reflects revenue growth, continued expense control and improved credit quality, particularly in the oil and gas-related loan portfolio. Net income increased in 2017 primarily due to a $198 million increase in net interest income, from growth in our lending and securities portfolios during the year, and short-term rate increases that positively impacted loan yields. Revenue also experienced a benefit from a $28 million increase related to noninterest income and credit costs, specifically the provision for loan losses, declined $69 million. These increases were partially offset by a $64 million increase in noninterest expense
Performance Relative to Previously Announced Initiatives
Efficiency Initiatives
In June 2015 we announced several initiatives to improve operational and financial performance along with some key financial targets. Our initiatives are designed to improve customer experience, to simplify the corporate structure and operations, and to make the Company a more efficient organization. Following is a brief discussion regarding our performance against these key financial targets:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Achieve an efficiency ratio in the low 60% range for fiscal year 2017. Our efficiency ratio for 2017 was 62.3%, which met our goal for the year, compared with 65.8% for 2016, representing a 351 bps improvement. Improvements in interest income from securities and loans, partially offset by an increase in adjusted noninterest expense, drove the significant improvement. See “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 29 for more information regarding the calculation of the adjusted efficiency ratio and why management uses this non-GAAP measure.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion in 2016, with a modest increase of 2-3% in 2017. We met our target for fiscal year 2016, keeping adjusted noninterest expense to $1.579 billion. In 2017, total adjusted noninterest expense was $1.640 billion. Zions made a $12 million contribution to a charitable foundation in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was related in part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the impact of this one-time accelerated contribution, adjusted noninterest expense increased $49 million, or 3%, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted noninterest expense excludes those same expense items excluded in arriving at the efficiency ratio (see “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 29 for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio).

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase returns on tangible common equity to more than ten percent. Returns were 9.0%, 7.1%, and 4.6% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Adjusting for the estimated net DTA write-off of $47 million through income tax expense associated with the decrease in the federal income tax rate from the passage of new legislation (see “Income Taxes” on page 45 for more information), and the $12 million charitable contribution, return on tangible common equity for 2017 would have been 9.9%. These year-over-year increases demonstrate our commitment to improving profitability, as we continue to work towards achieving this goal. See “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 29 for more information regarding the calculation of the adjusted efficiency ratio and why management uses this non-GAAP measure.

• Achieve cumulative gross pretax cost savings of $120 million from operational expense initiatives by fiscal year 2017. Savings from technology initiatives, the consolidation of legal charters, and improved operational efficiency across the Company helped us achieve this goal by the end of 2017.

Highlights in 2017
Net interest income, which is more than three-quarters of our revenue, improved by $198 million to $2.1 billion compared with 2016. The average balance of our investment securities portfolio grew $5.4 billion, and the average rate on those securities expanded 9 bps due in part to a change in asset mix. Our average lending portfolio also grew by 3% or $1.4 billion; the average yield on the loan portfolio increased 14 bps, reflecting in part several increases in short-term benchmark rates. Although there was a decrease in the average balance of long-term debt in 2017 of $286 million, this was offset by increased average Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and other short-term borrowings, which rose by $3.6 billion. Interest expense increased $40 million compared with 2016, almost entirely driven by the increase in wholesale funding. Interest expense on deposits increased only $10 million on more than $52 billion of average deposits. Some of the same factors that led to an increase in net interest income also resulted in net interest margin (“NIM”) expansion in 2017 relative to 2016, which was 3.45% and 3.37%, respectively.
Adjusted PPNR of $992 million in 2017 was up $172 million from 2016. This increase reflects operating leverage improvement resulting from loan growth and a more profitable average earning assets mix. Adjusted noninterest expense increased to $1.640 billion (or $1.628 billion, if excluding the charitable foundation contribution related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) from $1.579 billion in 2017, however, this was more than offset by improved revenue. PPNR improvements during 2017 have driven an improvement in the Company’s efficiency ratio from 65.8% in 2016 to 62.3% in 2017.
Our lending portfolio grew $2.1 billion based on year-end balances, or 5% during 2017. We have seen widespread growth across most products and geographies, with particular strength in 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal lending. We saw a small decline in our National Real Estate (“NRE”) portfolio, and we actively managed decreases in our oil and gas-related and CRE term portfolios. We are currently comfortable with the concentrations in both the oil and gas-related and CRE term portfolios and we do not expect the attrition trend to continue.
Asset quality has been very favorable during 2017. Credit quality in the oil and gas-related portfolio continues to strengthen and it has remained strong in the rest of the lending portfolio. Overall criticized, classified, and nonaccrual loans declined by $292 million, $444 million, and $127 million, respectively.
We continue to increase the return on- and of-capital. As previously mentioned, the Company’s return on average tangible common equity increased substantially in 2017 relative to 2016. Regarding return of capital, during the year, the Company repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $320 million. Dividends per common share were $0.44 in 2017, up from $0.28 in 2016. In June, 2017, we announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital actions in the Company’s 2017 capital plan (the binding portion of which spans the timeframe of July 2017 to June 2018). The plan included stepped quarterly common dividend increases, rising to $0.24 per share by the second quarter of 2018, and up to $465 million in common stock repurchases. See “Capital Management” on page 77 for more information regarding the 2018 capital plan.
We announced in 2013 that we had started a project to replace our core loan and deposit banking systems (“Core Transformation Project”). We successfully implemented the first phase of the TCS BαNCS® core servicing system in mid-2017, replacing our consumer lending system. The second phase is focused on the replacement of our commercial and construction lending systems is expected to be completed in 2019. The replacement of the deposit system is the third phase of the project. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $148 million of capitalized expenses associated with the Core Transformation Project. BαNCS® is a real time, parameter-driven servicing system that will provide long-term benefits to the Company by improving accessibility and functionality, allowing our bankers to better serve customers.

Areas Experiencing Challenges in 2017
Noninterest income from customer-related fees increased approximately 3% in 2017 from the prior year period, which was less than the targeted growth goal. We experienced strength in card activity (credit, debit, merchant), growth in the Company’s trust and wealth management initiatives, and increased foreign currency and derivative transactions made on behalf of customers. This growth was partially offset by a decline in loan sales and servicing income, which was mainly due to fewer sales of residential mortgages and a lower valuation adjustment on our agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value. We are targeting mid-single digit growth of customer-related fee income.
Noninterest expense increased to $1.649 billion from $1.585 billion in 2016, equivalent to a 4% increase. Adjusting for the one-time charitable contribution mentioned earlier, adjusted noninterest expense increased 3%, which is in line with announced forecasts. Employee costs, including salaries and benefits expenses, were higher in 2017 than in the prior year, partially due to a combination of higher incentive compensation and increased costs in the Company’s benefit plans. Depreciation and amortization expense was higher by $5 million, in part, because we placed into use a newly constructed office building at our Amegy affiliate and as previously mentioned we successfully implemented the first phase of our Core Transformation Project. FDIC premiums increased $13 million over the prior year, due in part to a surcharge assessed to large banks introduced by the FDIC in the third quarter of 2016 with the purpose of recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund.
Areas of Focus for 2018
In 2018, we are focused on the ongoing initiatives related to Company profitability and returns on equity. Major areas of emphasis include the following:

- -----------------------------------
• Achieve positive operating leverage

- --------------------------------------------------
◦ Maintain annual mid-single digit loan growth rates

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Achieve mid-single digit growth rates in customer-related fee income

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Maintain strong expense controls: we expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase slightly--a rate of growth in the low single digit percentage range

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Annual PPNR growth in the high single digit rate and further improvement to the efficiency ratio

- ------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Continue simplification of all aspects of how we do business

- ---------------------------------------
• Implement technology upgrade strategies

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase the return on and maintain or increase the return of capital

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continue to execute on our Community Bank Model – doing business on a “local” basis

- ---------------------------------------------------
• Merge the Parent into its bank subsidiary, ZB, N.A.

2 Includes loans held for sale.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Taxable-equivalent net interest income is the largest portion of our revenue. For 2017, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2.1 billion, compared with $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax rate used for calculating all taxable-equivalent adjustments was 35% for all years presented. The increase over 2016, and the previous increase over 2015, were driven by several factors, including a larger average securities portfolio balance, loan growth, and increases in benchmark interest rates that impacted loan yields. We expect the size of the securities portfolio to be relatively stable during the next several quarters, and we are not assuming any further increases in benchmark rates in our forecasts. Therefore, we expect net interest income to increase at a moderate pace in 2018 when compared with 2017.
Net Interest Margin and Interest Rate Spreads in 2017 vs. 2016
The NIM was 3.45% and 3.37% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Compared with 2016, changes in asset mix resulted in higher securities and loan balances, lower balances in money market investments, and higher balances of wholesale borrowings to fund overall balance sheet growth. Moving funds from money market investments to loans and securities had a positive impact on NIM, while funding balance sheet growth with wholesale borrowings reduced spreads and negatively impacted NIM, although it was accretive to net interest income. The NIM was also positively impacted by several increases in short-term interest rates. Average interest-earning assets increased $4.7 billion from 2016, with average rates improving 14 bps. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.6 billion and average rates increased 8 bps over the same period.
The average loan portfolio increased $1.4 billion, or 3% from 2016, with the majority of growth coming from 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal lending. Yields on average balances increased overall, buoyed by increases of 16 bps and 26 bps in the commercial and CRE portfolios, respectively; yields on average

36

Table of Contents

consumer balances were relatively flat during 2017. Much of the consumer growth was in consumer 1-4 family residential, where our yields are generally lower than on commercial loans. Benchmark interest rates increased several times beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, which has had a positive impact on NIM and spreads, as our earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our funding sources. A portion of our variable-rate loans were not affected by these changes primarily due to longer reset frequency, or because a substantial portion of our earning assets are tied to longer-term rates indices, which rates were impacted by a relatively flat yield curve for much of 2017. Additionally, NIM benefited from FDIC-supported loans by approximately 3 bps and 4 bps in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect continued strong growth in residential mortgages, with moderate growth in both CRE and commercial and industrial loans.
Average available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities balances increased $5.4 billion during 2017 and yields were also up 17 bps due to the effect of rising interest rates on variable-rate securities, moderation in the amount of prepayments on agency-guaranteed, mortgage-backed securities, and investment in products providing a higher yield than the average portfolio. The purchases were funded by using lower-yielding average money market investments, which were reduced by $2.1 billion, and wholesale borrowing from the FHLB. The investment portfolio has now reached a generally appropriate size relative to the balance sheet.
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits provided us with low-cost funding and comprised 45.6% of average total deposits, which totaled $52.2 billion in 2017, compared with 44.4% of average total deposits, which totaled $50.6 billion, for 2016. Average interest-bearing deposits increased only 1% in 2017, compared with 2016. Over the past 12 months the Federal Reserve has increased the overnight benchmark Federal Funds rate by 75 bps, while the rate paid on the Company’s interest-bearing deposits increased 3 bps. We have been selectively increasing deposit pricing in certain markets and with certain clients, but we have not generally experienced signific
ant pressure to broadly increase deposit rates. Although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our funding needs, we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to mid-sized business customers, which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our NIM. Including wholesale borrowings, the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 bps primarily due to borrowings increasing as a percentage of liabilities during 2017.
The average balance of long-term debt decreased $286 million compared with 2016, and although the average rate increased 61 bps in the current year, because remaining debt was at a higher average rate than the rate on debt that matured and was available to be called; overall interest expense thereon decreased $13 million. As mentioned previously, the Company has used short-term FHLB borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth. Average short-term debt grew $3.6 billion and the rate paid increased 78 bps. Further changes in short-term borrowings will be driven by balancing changes in deposits and loans as we do not foresee significant increases in investment security balances.
The spread on average interest-bearing funds was 3.27% and 3.23% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The spread on average interest-bearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the NIM.
We expect the mix of interest-earning assets to continue to change over the next several quarters due to solid consumer loan growth, accompanied by moderate growth in CRE term loans, and non-oil and gas-related commercial and industrial loans. We anticipate this growth will be partially offset by continued modest reduction in the NRE portfolio.
Interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold, the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used. Assuming no additional increases in the Federal Funds rate, we expect the yield on the securities portfolio to increase slightly, as the cash flow from the portfolio is redeployed into securities with yields that are slightly accretive to the overall portfolio. We expect the yield of the loan portfolio to increase somewhat due to the effects of rising interest rates in late 2017, partially offset by a continued modest change in the mix of the portfolio (increasing concentration in lower-yielding residential mortgages), as well as reduced income from higher-yielding loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009.

Our estimates of the Company’s interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both short-term and long-term interest rates, balance sheet composition, and other modeling assumptions, as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes. In addition, our modeled projections for noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which are a substantial portion of our deposit balances, are particularly reliant on assumptions for which there is little historical experience due to the prolonged period of very low interest rates. Further detail on interest rate risk is discussed in “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” on page 68.
Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section beginning on page 72 for more information on how we manage liquidity risk.
Net Interest Margin and Interest Rate Spreads in 2016 vs. 2015
The NIM was 3.37% and 3.19% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Market trends and competitive pricing led to generally flat or lower yields across loans and investments in 2016 compared with 2015. These yield adjustments were offset by changes in the Company’s asset mix, which in 2016 became less concentrated in lower-yielding money market investments, and more focused on higher-yielding agency securities and loans. Further contributing to the improvement was a decline in the Company’s cost of funds, due to higher amounts of noninterest-bearing deposits and tender offers, early calls and maturities of higher-rate debt, including the remaining trust preferred securities.
Average interest-earning assets increased $1.8 billion from 2015, with rates improving 12 bps. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $769 million and rates decreased 11 bps over the same period.
Our average loan portfolio was $1.9 billion higher during 2016, compared with 2015, although the average interest rate earned on the loan portfolio was 8 bps lower than it was in 2015 due to competitive pricing pressure and depressed interest rates. The larger average loan base generated an additional $45 million of taxable-equivalent interest income during the year. The largest average growth in 2016 was in the CRE portfolio, which also saw the average yield decline by 22 bps. The decline in loan yields occurred as new loans were originated or existing loans reset or were modified. See “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” on page 68 for further information regarding our interest rate sensitivity.
During 2016 we continued to purchase U.S. agency pass-through securities in order to alter the mix of our interest-earning assets that began in the second half of 2014. The average balance of AFS securities for 2016 increased by $4.4 billion or 84%, compared with 2015, and the average yield was flat at 1.93%. Average balances of money market investments over the same period declined $4.6 billion, with an average yield during 2016 of 0.59%. This asset movement had the largest impact on the improvement in NIM during 2016.
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits provided us with low cost funding and comprised 44.4% of average total deposits for 2016, compared with 43.9% for 2015. Average interest-bearing deposit balances increased by 3% in 2016 compared with 2015; additionally, the rate paid was flat at 18 bps.
The average balance of long-term debt was $313 million lower for 2016 compared with 2015. The reduced balance was the result of tender offers, early calls and maturities. The average interest rate on long-term debt for 2016 decreased by 157 bps compared with 2015. This was due to the maturity of higher cost long-term debt in the latter part of 2015, which had a greater impact on the average rate during 2016.
The lower cost of funds in 2016, compared with 2015, and improved yields on average interest-earning assets, contributed to the higher NIM and to an improvement in spread from 2.99% in 2015 to 3.23% in 2016.
The following schedule summarizes the average balances, the amount of interest earned or incurred, and the applicable yields for interest-earning assets and the costs of interest-bearing liabilities that generate taxable-equivalent net interest income.

Schedule 6 analyzes the year-to-year changes in net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the years indicated. For purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules, the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans. However, interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions. In addition, interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates.

In the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate, changes due to the volume/rate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions: when volume and rate both increase, the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate; when the rate increases and volume decreases, the variance is allocated to rate.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that, in our judgment, is required to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments (“RULC”) at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments. In determining adequate levels of the ALLL and RULC, we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios, the levels of actual charge-

Table of Contents

offs, credit trends, and external factors. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Credit Risk Management” on page 56 for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the ALLL and the RULC.
The provision for loan losses was $24 million in 2017, compared with $93 million in 2016. Credit quality was strong throughout 2017, with significant improvement in the oil and gas-related portfolio. Classified and nonaccrual loans in the total portfolio declined by $444 million and $127 million, respectively. Net charge-offs totaled $73 million in 2017, compared with $132 million in the prior year. These improvements in both credit quality and net charge-offs resulted in the lower provision. The Company has roughly $8 billion of loan balances in the geographic area impacted by Hurricane Harvey. During the third quarter of 2017, we added a qualitative allowance of $34 million based on multiple top-down and bottom-up analyses to estimate potential losses. During the fourth quarter, subsequent analysis indicated our losses may not be as large as we first believed and we released roughly one-third of the associated allowance.
The provision for unfunded lending commitments was $(7) million in 2017, compared with $(10) million in 2016. The negative provision in 2016 was primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to these obligations for credits outside the oil and gas-related portfolio along with declining oil and gas-related exposure. In 2017, improved credit quality, especially in the oil and gas-related portfolio, resulted in a further release of the RULC. From quarter to quarter, the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments, originations, fundings, and changes in credit quality.
The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”), which is the combination of both the ALLL and the RULC, decreased by $56 million during 2017. Even with loan growth and the above-mentioned hurricane impact, strong credit quality and decreased net charge-offs in the total loan portfolio were responsible for much of this reduction. Further, declining oil and gas-related exposure and increasing non-oil and gas-related commercial and industrial and 1-4 family residential mortgage exposure improved the risk profile of the portfolio.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield. For 2017, noninterest income was $544 million compared with $516 million in 2016 and $357 million in 2015. We believe a subtotal of customer-related fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct control. It excludes items such as dividends, insurance-related income, mark-to-market adjustments on certain derivatives, and securities gains and losses.
Schedule 7 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years.

Other service charges, commissions and fees, which are comprised of ATM fees, insurance commissions, bankcard merchant fees, debit and credit card interchange fees, cash management fees, and other miscellaneous fees, increased by $9 million compared with 2016. The increase relates mainly to higher credit card interchange fees and exchange and other fees. In 2016, other service charges, commissions and fees increased by $21 million compared with 2015. The increase was primarily a result of the same items mentioned previously, as well as fees generated on sales of interest rate swaps to clients.
During the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified bankcard rewards expense from noninterest expense into noninterest income in order to offset the associated revenue from interchange fees to align with industry practice. This reclassification within other service charges, commission and fees lowered noninterest income in the first quarter of 2016 and also decreased other noninterest expense by the same amount. For comparative purposes, we also reclassified prior period amounts. This reclassification had no impact on net income.
Wealth management and trust income increased by $5 million. The change was due to trust income, with improvement in both corporate and personal trust revenue due to platform and product simplifications. Wealth management and trust income increased $6 million between 2016 and 2015 for the same reasons.
Dividends and other investment income increased $16 million, primarily due to $14 million of gains across many of our cost and equity method investments. After consolidating seven banking charters into one in December 2015, our stock ownership with the FHLB system has decreased significantly and dividends thereon have also fallen. Due to increased use of FHLB borrowing during 2017, the Company has purchased FHLB activity stock as needed; however, the dividends received have not equaled the level seen prior to 2016. The consolidation also caused an increase in the Company’s ownership of Federal Reserve stock. Dividends on FRB stock were relatively flat between 2017 and 2016.
Loan sales and servicing income decreased $10 million in 2017, compared with 2016. During 2017, we ceased selling servicing-released mortgage loans to Freddie Mac, and therefore no longer received the associated servicing premiums for doing so, which decreased income by $11 million. In general, servicing income increased slightly in 2017. We also had particularly large valuation gains during 2016 on agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value, which did not repeat to the same extent in the current year. Loan sales and servicing income increased $4 million in 2016, compared with 2015, due mainly to these valuation gains on servicing assets.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased by $64 million or 4% to $1,649 million in 2017, compared with $1,585 million in 2016 and $1,581 million in 2015. Excluding the effect of a charitable foundation contribution of $12 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, noninterest expense increased in line with communicated forecasts. The Company remains focused on expense control efforts, while we continue to invest in our technology initiatives. Employee expenses were up, partially due to a combination of higher incentive compensation in 2017 as a result of improved Company performance and increased costs in the Company’s benefit plans. Expenses increased only $4 million between 2016 and 2015, with few major fluctuations in any category.
Schedule 8 presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years.

Salaries and employee benefits increased by $28 million, or 3%, in 2017, compared with 2016, as illustrated in Schedule 9. Base salaries were up in 2017, as employee salary expense rose roughly in line with inflation. Employee bonuses were up, partially due to lower incentive compensation for management in 2016 and larger commission expense in the current year. Benefits expense increased $9 million, or 6%, in 2017, primarily due to higher costs in the Company’s self-funded medical plans and an increase in profit sharing expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $10 million, or 1%, in 2016, compared with 2015 due to several reasons. Our investment in major systems projects led to headcount increases in more highly compensated roles, we had higher costs in our medical plans and also higher-than-expected retirement expense due to several large lump-sum payouts during the year.

Occupancy expense was up $4 million in 2017. We placed a newly constructed office building into operation during the first quarter and depreciation expense was consequently higher than in 2016. Rental income was higher in the current year because we are leasing space to tenants, but other costs surrounding the building implementation offset this benefit. Expense increased $5 million, or 4% in 2016 compared with 2015. The increase was due to a combination of small items including higher rent expense, lease depreciation, and building security.
During 2017, we successfully implemented the first release of the TCS BαNCS® core servicing system. Furniture and equipment expense increased $5 million in 2017 mainly due to amortization of capitalized software. Expense was relatively flat between 2016 and 2015.

FDIC premiums were $53 million, $40 million, and $34 million, in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Increases were due to higher deposit bases in each of the years and the FDIC’s increase in deposit insurance assessments that occurred in the third quarter of 2016. These increases were somewhat offset by a reduction in the Company’s overall rate resulting from the consolidation of the individual bank charters and the Bank’s lower risk profile.
Other noninterest expense was $223 million in 2017, compared with $213 million in 2016 and $225 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 was mainly due to the one-time charitable contribution made at the end of the year. The main driver for lower expense in 2016, compared with 2015, was lower levels of legal related expense.
In 2016, we held adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion, and expected an increase of between 2% and 3% in 2017. Excluding the impact of the previously discussed one-time charitable contribution of $12 million, the actual increase in adjusted noninterest expense was 3%, which was in line with our forecast. The expense items we exclude from noninterest expense to arrive at adjusted noninterest expense are the same as those excluded in arriving at the efficiency ratio (see “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 29 for more information regarding the calculation of the efficiency ratio).
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $344 million in 2017, $236 million in 2016, and $142 million in 2015. Our effective income tax rates, including the effects of noncontrolling interests, were 36.8% in 2017, 33.5% in 2016, and 31.5% in 2015. The tax expense rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bank-owned life insurance. The tax rate in 2017 was further impacted by the following items:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Reevaluation of state tax positions that resulted in a one-time $18 million benefit.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Excess tax benefit of $9 million from the implementation of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Estimated net DTA write-off of $47 million through income tax expense associated with the decrease in the federal income tax rate from the passage of new legislation.

Further, the tax rate in 2015 decreased significantly as a result of the Company’s investments in alternative energy and technology initiatives. The Company continued to invest in technology initiatives and increased investment in municipal securities during 2016 and 2017, generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), was signed into law. The Act makes significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. As stated above, the estimated provisional impact of the Act on the net DTA resulted in a non-cash charge of $47 million through income tax expense. The Company anticipates that additional adjustments to net DTA and income tax expense may be made in 2018 as deferred tax estimates are finalized for inclusion in the 2017 federal and state tax returns to be filed, consistent with the measurement period afforded by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”).
We had a net DTA balance of $93 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $250 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net DTA resulted primarily from the reduction in the federal income tax rate from the Act, accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property, the payment of deferred compensation, and a decrease in the allowance for loan losses. A decrease in deferred tax liabilities during 2017, which related primarily to the deferred gain on a prior period debt exchange, offset some of the overall net decrease.
We did not record any additional valuation allowance for GAAP purposes as of December 31, 2017. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” on page 80 for additional information.

Preferred Stock Dividends and Redemption
In 2017 we incurred preferred stock dividends of $40 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2016. In 2016 we incurred preferred stock dividends of $48 million, a decrease of $14 million from 2015. We completed a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2015 to purchase $176 million of our Series I preferred stock. We also completed tender offers of $144 million of Series F, and $118 million of Series I, J, and G in the second quarters of 2017, and 2016, respectively. Preferred dividends are expected to be $8 million in the first and third quarters of 2018, and $10 million in the second and fourth quarters of 2018. See further details in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
Following the close of business on December 31, 2015, we completed the merger of our subsidiary banks with Zions First National Bank. Subsequently, Zions First National Bank changed its legal name to ZB, National Association. We continue to manage our banking operations under our existing brand names and business segments, including Zions Bank, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, National Bank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and The Commerce Bank of Washington. Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographical structure.
As discussed in the “Executive Summary” on page 33, most of the lending and other decisions affecting customers are made at the local level. The accounting policies of the individual segments are the same as those of the Company. We allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services. Due to the charter consolidation, we have moved to an internal Funds Transfer Pricing allocation system to report results of operations for business segments. This process continues to be refined.
The operating segment identified as “Other” includes the Parent, certain nonbank financial service subsidiaries, centralized back-office functions, and eliminations of transactions between segments. The Parent’s operations are significant to the Other segment. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains for more information on the Other segment. The Company’s net interest income is substantially affected by the Parent’s interest expense on long-term debt. The Parent’s financial statements in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide more information about the Parent’s activities. We have announced our intention to merge the parent company into ZB, N.A. The merger is not expected to have an impact to the results of the Other operating segment.
During 2017, our banking operations experienced improved financial performance. Common areas of financial performance experienced at various levels of the segments include:

- ------------------------------------------------------
• increased loan balances across almost all geographies;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• improvements in credit quality resulted in reductions of the ALLL; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• growth in customer deposit balances across almost all segments.

Zions Bank
Zions Bank is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is primarily responsible for conducting operations in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. If it were a separately chartered bank, it would be the 2nd largest full-service commercial bank in Utah and the 4th largest in Idaho, as measured by domestic deposits in these states.
Within Zions Bank, the NRE group is a wholesale business that generally sources loans from other community banks across the country. Such loans are generally low loan-to-value owner-occupied loans, but also include non-owner-occupied CRE term loans.
Zions Bank’s income before income taxes decreased by $25 million, or 7%, during 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in the provision for loan losses. The loan portfolio decreased by $92 million during 2017, which consisted of a decrease of $284 million in commercial loans and increases of $111 million and $81 million in CRE and consumer loans, respectively. Within commercial lending, commercial owner-occupied loans decreased by $128 million, which was mainly the result of a reduction in the NRE loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to net loans and leases decreased to 1.04% at December 31, 2017 from 1.15% at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming lending-related assets declined 19% from the prior year due primarily to decreases in nonaccrual loans in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Deposits decreased 4% from 2016 to 2017.
Amegy Bank
Amegy Bank is headquartered in Houston, Texas. If it were a separately chartered bank, it would be the 8th largest full-service commercial bank in Texas as measured by domestic deposits in the state.

The increase in income before income taxes is mainly due to a $138 million decrease in the provision for loan losses. Amegy has been able to achieve loan portfolio growth, resulting in an $835 million increase from the prior year. During 2017, CRE loans decreased by $64 million and commercial and consumer loans increased by $395 million, and $504 million, respectively. The credit quality of Amegy’s loan portfolio improved during 2017, mainly due to improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio; the ratio of the ALLL to net loans and leases decreased to 2.17% at December 31, 2017 from 2.49% a year earlier. During 2017, nonperforming lending-related assets decreased $124 million, or 34%. Deposits decreased by 8% from 2016 to 2017.

NBAZ’s income before income taxes increased by $17 million, or 19%, during 2017 due to a $5 million improvement in the provision for loan losses, in addition to increased net interest income from loan growth and improved fee revenue. The loan portfolio increased during 2017 by $144 million, driven by a $206 million increase in commercial loans and a $51 million increase in consumer loans, partially offset by a decrease of $113 million in CRE loans. The credit quality of NBAZ’s loan portfolio continues to improve, and the ratio of ALLL to net loans

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Interest-Earning Assets
Interest-earning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them. One of our goals is to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum. Interest-earning assets consist of money market investments, securities, loans, and leases.
Schedule 5, which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income, includes the average balances of our interest-earning assets, the amount of revenue generated by them, and their respective yields. Another goal is to maintain a higher-yielding mix of interest-earning assets, such as loans, relative to lower-yielding assets, while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets. As a result of this goal we redeployed funds from lower-yielding money market investments, in addition to using wholesale borrowings, to purchase agency securities.

Table of Contents

Average interest-earning assets were $60.9 billion in 2017 compared with $56.2 billion in the previous year. Average interest-earning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 93.5% in both 2017 and 2016.
Average loans were $43.5 billion in 2017 and $42.1 billion in 2016. Average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 66.8% in 2017 compared with 70.0% in 2016.
Average money market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements, decreased by 58% to $1.5 billion in 2017 compared with $3.7 billion in 2016. Average securities increased by 53% from 2016. Average total deposits increased by 3%; average total loans also increased by 3% in 2017 when compared with 2016.

Investment Securities Portfolio
We invest in securities to actively manage liquidity and interest rate risk, in addition to generating revenue for the Company. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section on page 72 for additional information on management of liquidity and funding and compliance with Basel III and LCR requirements. The following schedule presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio. The amortized cost amounts represent the original cost of the investments, adjusted for related accumulated amortization or accretion of any yield adjustments, and for impairment losses, including credit-related impairment. The estimated fair value measurement levels and methodology are discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The amortized cost of investment securities at December 31, 2017 increased by 12% from the balance at December 31, 2016, primarily due to purchases of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.
The investment securities portfolio includes $555 million of net premium that is distributed across various asset classes as illustrated in the preceding schedule. The purchase premiums and discounts for both held-to-maturity (“HTM”) and AFS securities are amortized and accreted at a constant effective yield to the contractual maturity date and no assumption is made concerning prepayments. As principal prepayments occur, the portion of the unamortized premium or discount associated with the principal reduction is recognized as interest income in the period the principal is reduced. Premium amortization for 2017 was approximately $125 million, compared with approximately $99 million in 2016, reducing the yield on securities in those years by 92 and 109 bps, respectively. The increased premium amortization is due to both an increased amount of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and SBA loan-backed securities and changes in actual prepayment rates of underlying loans.
As of December 31, 2017, under the GAAP fair value accounting hierarchy, 1% of the $15.2 billion fair value of the AFS securities portfolio was valued at Level 1, 99% was valued at Level 2, and there were no Level 3 AFS securities. At December 31, 2016, 1% of the $13.4 billion fair value of AFS securities portfolio was valued at Level 1, 99% was valued at Level 2, and there were no Level 3 AFS securities. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of fair value accounting.
Schedule 12 presents the maturities of the different types of investments that we owned and the corresponding average yields as of December 31, 2017 based on amortized cost. Expected maturities, rather than contractual maturities, are shown for SBA securities, agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency and municipal securities. See “Liquidity Risk Management” on page 72 and Notes 1, 5 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our investment securities and their management.

At December 31, 2017, one municipal loan with a balance of $1 million was on nonaccrual. A significant amount of the municipal loan and lease portfolio is secured by real estate and equipment, and 79% of the outstanding credits were originated by CB&T, Zions Bank, and Vectra. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans.

Growth in municipal exposure came primarily from increases in loans and leases and the municipal AFS securities portfolio. AFS securities generally consist of securities with investment-grade ratings from one or more major credit rating agencies.
Foreign Exposure and Operations
Our credit exposure to foreign sovereign risks and total foreign credit exposure is not significant. We also do not have significant foreign exposure to derivative counterparties. We had no foreign deposits at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of consumer mortgage and small business loans to be sold in the secondary market, were $44 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $172 million at December 31, 2016. These consumer loans are primarily fixed-rate mortgages that are originated with the intent to be sold to third parties.
Loan Portfolio
As of December 31, 2017, net loans and leases accounted for 68% of total assets compared with 67% at the end of 2016. Schedule 14 presents our loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent year-ends. The schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of December 31, 2017. However, while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans, in a small number of cases, we have hedged the repricing characteristics of our variable-rate loans as more fully described in “Interest Rate Risk” on page 68.

As of December 31, 2017, net loans and leases were $45 billion, reflecting a 5% increase from the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to new loan originations and loan purchases.
Loan portfolio growth during 2017 was widespread across loan products and geographies with particular strength in consumer 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial (non-oil and gas), municipal, and commercial owner-occupied loans. The growth in the loan portfolio was primarily at Amegy, CB&T, and Vectra.
Of the significant increases within the portfolio, consumer 1-4 family residential loans increased $771 million, due largely to an increase in loan production and loan purchases, and commercial and industrial loans increased $551 million. The impact of these increases was partially offset by a decrease of $219 million in our CRE term portfolio.
Commercial owner-occupied loans also increased $326 million during 2017 and $188 million during 2016. Although we experienced continued runoff and attrition of the NRE portfolio at Zions Bank, these declines are not expected to continue at the same pace in 2018. The NRE business is a wholesale business that depends upon loan referrals from other community banking institutions. Due to generally soft loan demand nationally, many community banking institutions are retaining, rather than selling, their loan production.
We expect moderate total loan and lease growth during 2018, primarily in consumer 1-4 family residential, municipal, commercial and industrial (non-oil and gas), commercial owner-occupied (non-NRE), and CRE term loans. We expect stable to slightly increasing growth in oil and gas loans, partially offset by moderate attrition in the NRE loan portfolio.

Loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to $3.7 billion during 2017 from $3.5 billion in 2016.
Other Noninterest-Bearing Investments
During 2017, the Company increased its short-term borrowings with the FHLB by $3.1 billion. This increase required a further investment in FHLB activity stock, which consequently increased by $124 million during the year. Aside from this increase, other noninterest-bearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule. Schedule 15 sets forth our other noninterest-bearing investments.

Premises, Equipment and Software, Net
Net premises, equipment and software, increased $74 million, or 7%, from the prior year primarily due to capitalized costs associated with the development of a new corporate facility for Amegy Bank in Texas, major software purchases, and the capitalization of eligible costs related to the development of new lending, deposit and reporting systems.
Deposits
Deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, are a primary source of funding for the Company. Average total deposits increased by 3% during 2017, compared with 2016, with average interest-bearing deposits increasing by 1% and average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing by 6%. The average interest rate paid for interest-bearing deposits was 3 bps higher in 2017 compared with 2016.
Deposits at December 31, 2017, excluding time deposits of $100,000 and over and brokered deposits, decreased by 2%, or $1.0 billion, from December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in interest-bearing domestic savings and money market deposits.
Demand, savings, and money market deposits were 94% and 95% of total deposits at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total deposits included $1.6 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, of brokered deposits.

RISK ELEMENTS
Since risk is inherent in substantially all of the Company’s operations, management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance. The Board of Directors has appointed a Risk Oversight Committee (“ROC”) that consists of appointed Board members who oversee the Company’s risk management processes. The ROC meets on a regular basis to monitor and review Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) activities. As required by its charter, the ROC performs oversight for various ERM activities and approves ERM policies and activities as detailed in the ROC charter.
Management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company’s operations are exposed, including credit, interest rate and market, liquidity, and operational risks. These risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”) is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-related contract. Credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities, as well as from off-balance sheet credit instruments.
The Board of Directors, through the ROC, is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the Company. In addition, the ROC oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the Risk Appetite Framework. Additionally, the Board has established the Credit Administration Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and consisting of members of management, to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the Company and approving changes to the Company’s credit policies.
Centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies, credit risk management, and credit examination functions. Our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses. These formal credit policies and procedures provide the Company with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level.
Our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over, and the independent evaluation of, credit activities. In addition, we have a well-defined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio, and we utilize a comprehensive loan risk-grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio. Furthermore, the internal credit examination department, which is independent of the lending function, periodically conducts examinations of the Company’s lending departments and credit activities. These examinations are designed to review credit quality, adequacy of documentation, appropriate loan risk-grading administration, and compliance with credit policies. New, expanded, or modified products and services, as well as new lines of business, are approved by the New Initiative Review Committee.
Our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio. We attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty. Generally, our loan portfolio is well diversified; however, due to the nature of our geographical footprint, there are certain significant concentrations primarily in CRE and oil and gas-related lending. We have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending, municipal lending, oil and gas-related lending, and various types of CRE lending, particularly construction and land development lending. All of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary. The recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits. Our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates.
As we continue to monitor our concentration risk, the composition of our loan portfolio has slightly changed. Oil and gas-related loans represented 4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, compared with 5% at December 31, 2016. Total commercial loans were 51% of the total portfolio, compared with 50% at December 31,

2016. CRE loans declined to 25% of the total portfolio, compared with 27% at December 31, 2016. Consumer loans grew to represent 24% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, compared with 23% at December 31, 2016.

1 Because many borrowers operate in multiple businesses, judgment has been applied in characterizing a borrower as oil and gas-related, including a particular segment of oil and gas-related activity, e.g., upstream or downstream; typically, 50% of revenues coming from the oil and gas sector is used as a guide.

3 Calculated as the ratio of annualized net charge-offs to the beginning loan balances for each respective period.

During 2017, our overall balance of oil and gas-related loans decreased by $185 million, or 9%, from year-end 2016. Oil and gas-related loans represented 4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, compared with 5% at December 31, 2016. Unfunded oil and gas-related lending commitments increased by $186 million, or 11%. The increase in unfunded oil and gas-related lending commitments was primarily in the midstream portfolio.
Classified oil and gas-related credits decreased to $354 million at December 31, 2017, from $681 million at December 31, 2016. Oil and gas-related loan net charge-offs were $36 million for 2017, compared with $130 million for 2016. At December 31, 2017, the ACL related to the oil and gas-related portfolio was approximately 7% of oil and gas-related balances, compared with 9% at December 31, 2016.
Nonaccruing oil and gas-related loans decreased by $143 million during 2017, primarily in the oil and gas services and upstream portfolios. Approximately 88% of oil and gas-related nonaccruing loans were current as to principal and interest payments at December 31, 2017, which increased from 86% at December 31, 2016.
Risk Management of the Oil and Gas-Related Portfolio
The oil and gas-related portfolio is comprised of three primary segments: upstream, midstream, and oil and gas services. Upstream exploration and production loan borrowers have relatively balanced production between oil and gas. Midstream loans are made to companies that gather, transport, treat and blend oil and natural gas, or that provide services to similar companies. Oil and gas services loans, which include oilfield services and oil and gas service manufacturing, include borrowers that have a concentration of revenues in the oil and gas industry. However, many of these borrowers provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry and are diversified geographically.

59

Table of Contents

We apply concentration limits and disciplined underwriting to the entire oil and gas-related loan portfolio to limit our risk exposure. As an indicator of the diversity in the size of our oil and gas-related portfolio, the average amount of our commitments is approximately $6 million, with approximately 67% of the commitments less than $30 million. Additionally, there are instances where we have commitments to companies with a common sponsor which, if combined, would result in higher commitment levels than $30 million. The portfolio contains only senior loans—no junior or second lien positions; additionally, we cautiously approach making first-lien loans to borrowers that employ excessive leverage through the use of junior lien loans or unsecured layers of debt. Approximately 88% of the total oil and gas-related portfolio is secured by reserves, equipment, real estate, and other collateral, or a combination of collateral types.
We participate as a lender in loans and commitments designated as Shared National Credits (“SNCs”), which generally consist of larger and more diversified borrowers that have better access to capital markets. SNCs are loans or loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised institutions. The percentage of SNCs is 79% of the upstream portfolio, 79% of the midstream portfolio, and 44% of the oil and gas services portfolio. Our bankers have direct access and contact with the management of these SNC borrowers, and as such, are active participants. In many cases, we provide ancillary banking services to these borrowers, further evidencing this direct relationship. The results of the fall 2017 SNC exam are reflected in our financial statements.
As a secondary source of support, many of our oil and gas-related borrowers have access to capital markets and private equity sources. Private sponsors tend to be large funds, often with assets under management of more than $1 billion, managed by individuals with a great deal of oil and gas expertise and experience and who have successfully managed investments through previous oil and gas price cycles. The investors in the funds are primarily institutional investors, such as large pensions, foundations, trusts, and high net worth family offices.

Approximately 20% of the CRE term loans consist of mini-perm loans as of December 31, 2017. For such loans, construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a mini-perm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards. Mini-perm loans generally have initial maturities of three to seven years. The remaining 80% of CRE loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years. The stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project, loan-to-value ratio, and occupancy rates.
Approximately $144 million, or 10%, of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at December 31, 2017 consists of acquisition and development loans. Most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail, apartment, office, or other projects.
Of the total CRE loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, we categorize $1.8 billion as retail property, where the ultimate use of the property is for retailing purposes. The average loan-to-value ratio for these loans is approximately 55%, and more than 90% are occupied. Approximately 81% of our CRE retail loans are to borrowers where the underlying retail businesses are not regional shopping centers, but include neighborhood strip malls, stand-alone retail facilities, and single-tenant buildings. Of the regional shopping center exposure, approximately 94% is term debt, and the criticized loan ratio is 5.3%. We closely monitor the CRE retail portfolio for tenant bankruptcy filings and store closures, and have limited exposure to national tenants with announced bankruptcies.
Underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor. We generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances. Remargining requirements (required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor. Recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow, the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt. Therefore, in most projects (with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects), we require substantial pre-leasing/leasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 or higher, depending on the project asset class.
Within the residential construction and development sector, many of the requirements previously mentioned, such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer, up-front injection of the developer’s equity, principal curtailment requirements, and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan. Significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product, location, strength of the developer, and the ability of the developer to stay within budget. Progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made.
Real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower, generally by our internal appraisal review function, which is staffed by licensed appraisers. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. A new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness.
Advance rates (i.e., loan commitments) will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor, but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50% for raw land, 65% for land development, 65% for finished commercial lots, 75% for finished residential lots, 80% for pre-sold homes, 75% for models and homes not under contract, and 75% for commercial properties. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.
Loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules, rent rolls and, on construction projects, independent progress inspection reports. The receipt of this financial information is monitored and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement.
The existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing CRE loans for impairment. If the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented, it is included in the

potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment, and our impairment methodology takes this repayment source into consideration.
When we modify or extend a loan, we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty, and whether we have granted a concession. In determining if an interest rate concession has been granted, we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics. If the rate in the modification is less than current market rates, it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists. However, if additional collateral is obtained, or if a guarantor exists who has the capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis, we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted.
In general, we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan. The quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting, the size of the transaction, and the strength of the guarantor.
Complete underwriting of the guarantor includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements, leverage, liquidity, global cash flow, global debt service coverage, contingent liabilities, etc. The assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations. Additional analysis may include personal financial statements, tax returns, liquidity (brokerage) confirmations, and other reports, as appropriate.
A qualitative assessment is performed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience, performance track record, reputation, and willingness to work with us. We also utilize market information sources, rating, and scoring services in our assessment. This qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higher-quality internal loan grade, which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate. Previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan.
In the event of default, we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment, which may come from multiple sources, including the guarantee. A number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor, including, but not limited to, the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment (collateral), the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor, possible statutory limitations (e.g., single action rule on real estate) and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover. In other instances, the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies.
A decrease in oil and gas prices could potentially produce an adverse impact on our CRE loan portfolio within Texas. However, based upon generally strong equity and cash flow coverage levels, and sponsor support for the various properties, we do not expect a material amount of losses within this portfolio in 2018. Our largest CRE credit exposures in Texas are to the multi-family, office, and retail sectors. At December 31, 2017, the CRE loan portfolio mix in Texas was 72% commercial term, 16% commercial construction, 8% residential construction, and 4% land development.

Consumer Loans
We have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages, generally considered to be of prime quality. We generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixed-rate loans to third parties, including Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards.
We are engaged in Home Equity Credit Line (“HECL”) lending. At December 31, 2017, our HECL portfolio totaled $2.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The following schedule describes the composition of our HECL portfolio by lien status.

Secured by first deeds of trust $ 1,406 $ 1,383
Secured by second (or junior) liens 1,371 1,262
Total $ 2,777 $ 2,645

At December 31, 2017, loans representing less than 1% of the outstanding balance in the HECL portfolio were estimated to have combined loan-to-value ratios (“CLTV”) above 100%. An estimated CLTV ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral-value. At origination, underwriting standards for the HECL portfolio generally include a maximum 80% CLTV with high credit scores at origination.
Approximately 93% of our HECL portfolio is still in the draw period, and approximately 26% of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years. We regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates. The analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment. The ratio of net charge-offs to average balances at year-end 2017 and 2016 for the HECL portfolio was 0.02% and 0.01%, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned (“OREO”) decreased to 0.93% at December 31, 2017, compared with 1.34% at December 31, 2016.
Total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 decreased $155 million from December 31, 2016, primarily in the oil and gas-related loan portfolio. However, nonaccrual loans slightly increased in the commercial owner-occupied and 1-4 family residential loan portfolios. The largest total decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred at Amegy.
The balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns, charge-offs, and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions. If a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured, the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual. If a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months, the loan can be considered for return to accrual status. See “Restructured Loans” following for more information. Company policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to CRE term loans. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on nonaccrual loans.

Restructured Loans
Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties, and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider. TDRs decreased $25 million, or 10%, during 2017, primarily due to payments and payoffs. Commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project, to achieve a higher lease-up percentage, to sell the property, or for other reasons. Consumer loan TDRs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender, or who is experiencing economic hardship.

65

Table of Contents

If the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms, and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest, the loan may be returned to accrual status. The borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan should be returned to accrual status.

Interest Rate and Market Risk Management
Interest rate and market risk are managed centrally. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk.
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the Company, including interest rate and market risk management. The Board has established the Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) consisting of members of management, to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the Company. ALCO establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the ROC the limits and limit exceptions reported by management.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed. In general, our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates.
Over the course of the last year, we have actively reduced the level of asset sensitivity through the purchase of short-to-medium duration agency pass-through securities and funding these purchases by reducing money market investments and increasing short-term borrowings. This repositioning of the investment portfolio has increased current net interest income while dampening the impact of higher rates on net interest income growth. We continue to anticipate higher net interest income in a rising rate environment as our assets reprice more quickly than our liabilities.
As most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits, behavioral assumptions for these deposits have a significant impact on our projected interest rate risk. We have historically reported two sets of deposit assumptions, fast and slow, to reflect the uncertainty of deposit behavior and its impact on interest rate risk. We have recently updated our deposit models and now disclose interest rate risk for only a single set of deposit behavioral assumptions. The newly implemented method differs from prior methods primarily in the way we treat commercial checking deposits and in the manner by which we determine the portion of deposits that are core deposits. For commercial checking deposits, we have separated the balances into a core amount that is operational or that compensates for billed services, and a complementary excess balance. The excess balance is modeled with a high attrition rate, whereas the core balance runs off more slowly. For other deposit types, the core balance is determined by the average balance over a longer-term horizon, typically 24 to 48 months, and excess balances are modeled with a high attrition rate.
Interest Rate Risk Measurement
We monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods: net interest income simulation, or Earnings at Risk (“EaR”), and Economic Value of Equity at Risk (“EVE”). EaR analyzes the expected change in near term (one year) net interest income in response to changes in interest rates. In the EVE method, we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates.
EaR is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments over a one-year period. EaR is measured simulating net interest income under several different scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve, taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio (e.g., a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower-rate environment). Our policy contains a trigger for a 10%

68

Table of Contents

decline over one-year in rate sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps.
EVE is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities. We measure changes in the dollar amount of EVE for parallel shifts in interest rates. Due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk, changes in EVE can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes. Examples of such risks may include out-of-the-money interest rate caps (or limits) on loans, which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur, or substantial prepayment deceleration for low-rate mortgages in a higher-rate environment. Our policy contains a trigger for an 8% decline in EVE as well as a risk capacity of a 10% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps. Exceptions to the EVE limits are subject to notification and approval by the ROC.
Estimating the impact on net interest income and EVE requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. The assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration (e.g., customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit), competitive pricing (e.g., existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates), loan and security prepayments, and the effects of other similar embedded options. As a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans, we also calculate the sensitivity of EaR and EVE results to key assumptions. The modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for deposits that do not have specific maturities, such as checking, savings and money market accounts, and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options. We use historical regression analysis as a guide to set such assumptions; however, due to the current low interest rate environment, which has little historical precedent, estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results. Additionally, competition for funding in the marketplace has, and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interest-bearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR or the federal funds rate.
Under most rising interest rate environments, we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interest-bearing accounts such as money market, savings, or certificates of deposit. The models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration.
In addition, we assume certain correlation rates, often referred to as a “deposit beta,” of interest-bearing deposits, wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates. Generally, certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate, while interest-on-checking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate. Actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing, money supply, credit worthiness of the Company, and so forth; however, we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions.
The aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in Schedule 27.

For non-maturity interest-bearing deposits, the weighted average modeled beta is 36.2%. If the weighted average deposit beta increased to 46.2% it would decrease the EaR in the +200bp shock from 5.4% to 2.9%.
The EaR analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates. The yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner. During the past year, an increase in short-term rates has led to a flatter yield curve as longer-term rates have not increased at the same pace as short-term rates. If we consider a flattening rate shock where the short-term rate moves +200bp but the ten-year rate only moves +30bp, the increase in earnings is 33% lower over 12 months compared with the parallel +200bp rate shock.

Our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the Company’s asset-liability management posture. At December 31, 2017, $19.8 billion of the Company’s commercial lending and CRE loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate loans approximately 94% are tied to either the prime rate or LIBOR. For these variable-rate loans we have executed $1.1 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps. Additionally, asset sensitivity is reduced due to $0.2 billion of variable-rate loans being priced at floored rates at December 31, 2017, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 60 bps. At December 31, 2017, we also had $3.3 billion of variable-rate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate consumer loans approximately $0.1 billion were priced at floored rates, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 42 bps.
See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments.
Market Risk – Fixed Income
We engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities. This trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities.
At December 31, 2017, we had a relatively small amount, $148 million, of trading assets and $95 million of securities sold, not yet purchased, compared with $115 million and $25 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.
We are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value. We are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of AFS securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in AOCI for each financial reporting period. During 2017, the after-tax change in AOCI attributable to AFS securities decreased by $3 million, due largely to changes in the interest rate environment, compared with a $74 million decrease in the same prior year period.
Market Risk – Equity Investments
Through our equity investment activities, we own equity securities that are publicly-traded. In addition, we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities, e.g., Federal Reserve Bank and an FHLB, that are not publicly-traded. The accounting for equity investments may use the cost, fair value, equity, or full consolidation methods of accounting, depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs. Regardless of the accounting method, the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation. Because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs, we are exposed to the possibility of loss. Equity investments in private and public companies are approved, monitored, and evaluated by the Company’s Equity Investments Committee consisting of members of management.
We hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly pre-public companies, primarily through various Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) venture capital funds. Our equity exposure to these investments was approximately $127 million and $124 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. On occasion, some of the companies within our SBIC investments may issue an initial public offering. In this case, the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment, which can introduce additional market risk. During the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold the remaining amount of our publicly-traded direct investment and as of December 31, 2017, we had no publicly-traded stocks as part of our direct SBIC investments.

Additionally, Amegy has an alternative investments portfolio. These investments are primarily directed towards equity buyout and mezzanine funds with a key strategy of deriving ancillary commercial banking business from the portfolio companies. Early stage venture capital funds are generally not a part of the strategy because the underlying companies are typically not creditworthy. The carrying value of Amegy’s equity investments was $12 million at December 31, 2017 and $13 million at December 31, 2016.
These PEIs are subject to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and bank holding companies from holding PEIs, except for SBIC funds and certain other permitted exclusions, beyond a required deadline. The FRB announced in December 2016 that it would allow banks to apply for an additional five-year extension beyond the July 21, 2017 deadline to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement for these investments. The Company applied for and was granted an extension for its eligible PEIs. All positions in the remaining portfolio of PEIs are subject to the extended deadline or other applicable exclusions.
As of December 31, 2017, such prohibited PEIs amounted to $3 million, with an additional $4 million of unfunded commitments (see Notes 5 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). We currently do not believe that this divestiture requirement will ultimately have a material impact on our financial statements.

Liquidity Risk Management
Overview
Liquidity risk is the possibility that our cash flows may not be adequate to fund our ongoing operations and meet our commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner. Since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk, many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk. We manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs, or capital plan actions and our anticipated financial and contractual obligations, which include withdrawals by depositors, debt and capital service requirements, and lease obligations.
Overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of ALCO, which implements a Board-approved corporate Liquidity and Funding Policy. This policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity, diversifying funding positions, and anticipating future funding needs. The policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines, such as the “time-to-required funding” and LCR, that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the Parent and ZB, N.A., as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the Parent and ZB, N.A.
The management of liquidity and funding is performed centrally for the Parent and jointly by the Parent and bank management for its subsidiary bank. The Treasury Department performs this management centrally, under the direction of the Corporate Treasurer, with oversight by ALCO. The Treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans, as well as to the Company’s Liquidity Policy. These recommendations must be submitted for approval to ALCO, and changes to the Policy also must be approved by the Company’s ERMC and the Board of Directors. The Company has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk. The policy requires the Company to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis. The Company targets a buffer of highly liquid assets at the Parent to cover 18-24 months of cash outflows under a scenario with limited cash inflows, and maintains a minimum policy limit of not less than 12 months. The consolidated Company exceeds the regulatory requirements of the Modified LCR that mandates a buffer of HQLA to cover 70% of 30-day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated in the Final Liquidity Rule. Additionally, the Company performs monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12-month horizon. ZB, N.A. maintains a buffer of highly liquid assets consisting of cash, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Government Sponsored Entity securities to cover 30-day cash outflows under liquidity stress tests and maintains a contingency funding plan to identify funding sources that would be utilized over the extended 12-month horizon. Throughout 2017 and as of December 31, 2017, the Company complied with this policy.

Liquidity Regulation
U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule in 2014 that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under this rule, we are subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered HQLA that can be converted into cash easily and immediately in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a short-term liquidity stress scenario. This rule became applicable to us on January 1, 2016.
The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the NSFR, which requires a financial institution to maintain a stable funding profile over a one-year period in relation to the characteristics of its on- and off-balance sheet activities. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final standards for this ratio, entitled Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio. On May 3, 2016, the FRB issued a proposal requiring bank holding companies with less than $250 billion of assets, but more than $50 billion of assets, to cover 70% of 1-year cash outflows under the assumptions required in the proposed NSFR Rule. Under the proposal, bank holding companies would be required to publicly disclose information about the NSFR levels each quarter. As of December 31, 2017, the FRB has not published final rules on the NSFR. We continue to monitor this proposal and any other developments. Based on this Basel III publication and the FRB proposal, we believe we would meet the minimum NSFR if such requirement were currently effective.
The Enhanced Prudential Standards for liquidity management (Reg. YY) require us to conduct monthly liquidity stress tests. These tests incorporate scenarios designed by us, require a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover 30-day funding needs under the stress scenarios, and are subject to review by the FRB. The Company’s internal liquidity stress testing program as contained in its policy complies with these requirements and includes monthly liquidity stress testing using a set of internally generated scenarios representing severe liquidity constraints over a 12-month horizon.

Table of Contents

In addition to the commitments specifically noted in Schedule 30, we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business. These include software licensing and maintenance, telecommunications services, facilities maintenance and equipment servicing, supplies purchasing, and other goods and services used in the operation of our business. Generally, these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually, although in some cases to secure favorable pricing concessions, we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years.
We also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest. The fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on derivative contracts.
Liquidity Management Actions
Consolidated cash, interest-bearing deposits held as investments, and security resell agreements at the Parent and its subsidiaries decreased to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016. The $0.9 billion decrease during 2017 resulted primarily from (1) Net loan originations and purchases, (2) an increase in investment securities, (3) a net decrease in deposits, (4) repurchase of our common stock, (5) repayment of our long-term debt, (6) repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock, and (7) dividends on common and preferred stock. These decreases were partially offset by short-term FHLB borrowings and net cash provided by operating activities.
During 2017 our HTM and AFS investment securities increased by $1.7 billion. This increase was primarily due to purchases of short-to-medium duration agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Prior to the second quarter of 2017, we were adding to our investment portfolio during the past couple of years to increase our HQLA position in light of the new LCR rules and more broadly, to manage balance sheet liquidity more effectively. However, during the second through the fourth quarters of 2017, our HTM and AFS investment securities decreased by $490 million, and we expect the size of the investment portfolio to be generally stable during the next several quarters.
During 2017 we made cash payments totaling $153 million for our long-term debt which matured and did not incur any new long-term debt during the same time period. See Note 12 for additional detail about debt maturities and redemptions during 2017 and 2016. During 2017, we also increased our short-term debt with the FHLB by $3.1 billion, and had $3.6 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
Parent Company Liquidity – The Parent’s cash requirements consist primarily of debt service, investments in and advances to subsidiaries, operating expenses, income taxes, and dividends to preferred and common shareholders. The Parent’s cash needs are usually met through dividends from its subsidiaries, interest and investment income, subsidiaries’ proportionate shares of current income taxes, and long-term debt and equity issuances.
Cash and interest-bearing deposits held as investments at the Parent decreased to $332 million at December 31, 2017 from $531 million at December 31, 2016. This $199 million decrease during 2017 resulted primarily from (1) repurchase of our common stock, (2) repayment of long-term debt, (3) repurchase and redemption of our preferred stock and (4) dividends on our common and preferred stock. This decrease in cash was partially offset by common dividends and return of common equity and preferred dividends received by the Parent from its subsidiary bank. See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our long-term debt and equity transactions.
During 2017, the Parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling $534 million and preferred dividends totaling $53 million from its subsidiary bank. During 2016 the Parent received common dividends and return of common equity totaling $250 million and preferred dividends totaling $13 million from its subsidiary bank. At December 31, 2017, ZB, N.A., had $417 million available for the payment of dividends under current capital regulations. The dividends that ZB, N.A. can pay are restricted by current and historical earning levels, retained earnings, and risk-based and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations.

General financial market and economic conditions impact our access to, and cost of, external financing. Access to funding markets for the Parent and its subsidiary bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies. The ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings, but can also influence the sources of the borrowings. The debt ratings and outlooks issued by the various rating agencies for the Company and ZB, N.A. improved during 2017 and are shown in the following schedules.
Schedule 31 presents the Company’s and ZB, N.A.’s ratings as of December 31, 2017.
Schedule 31
CREDIT RATINGS

------------- -------- -------- ----------------------------------- ------- ------------------------ ---------------------- --------

 Company ZB, N.A. Company ZB, N.A. Company ZB, N.A.
Rating agency Outlook Long-term issuer/senior debt rating Subordinated debt rating Short-term debt rating

S&P Positive Positive BBB- BBB BB+ A-2
Moody’s Stable Stable Baa3 Baa3 P-2
Kroll Positive Positive BBB BBB+ BBB- K2

The credit rating agencies all rate the Company’s and ZB, N.A.’s senior debt at an investment-grade level. In addition, Kroll rates the Company’s subordinated debt at an investment-grade level, while S&P rates the Company’s subordinated debt as noninvestment-grade.
The Parent’s cash payments for interest, reflected in operating expenses, decreased to $26 million in 2017 from $35 million in 2016 due to the maturity and repayment of long-term debt during 2017 and 2016, partially offset by the increase in interest from short-term FHLB advances. Additionally, the Parent paid approximately $129 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock for 2017 compared to $108 million for 2016.
Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains the Parent’s statements of income and cash flows for 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as its balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
At December 31, 2017, maturities of our long-term senior and subordinated debt ranged from June 2023 to September 2028, with effective interest rates from 4.50% to 6.95%.
See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete summary of our long-term debt.
Subsidiary Bank Liquidity – ZB, N.A.’s primary source of funding is its core deposits, consisting of demand, savings and money market deposits, and time deposits under $250,000. On a consolidated basis, the Company’s loan to total deposit ratio was 85.1% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 80.1% as of December 31, 2016, reflecting loan growth and a decrease in deposits during 2017.
Total deposits decreased by $615 million to $52.6 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $53.2 billion at December 31, 2016. This decrease was a result of a $744 million decrease in savings and money market deposits and a $229 million decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The decrease was partially offset by a $358 million increase in time deposits. Also, during the first quarter of 2017, ZB, N.A. redeployed approximately $2.6 billion of cash to short-to-medium duration agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.
ZB, N.A.’s long-term senior debt ratings are slightly better than the Company’s long-term senior debt ratings. Moody’s rated both ZB, N.A.’s and the Company’s long-term senior debt as Baa3. However, Standard & Poor’s and Kroll both rated ZB, N.A.’s long-term senior debt one notch higher than the Company’s ratings (see Schedule 31).
The FHLB system and Federal Reserve Banks have been and are a source of back-up liquidity, and from time to time, have been a significant source of funding. ZB, N.A. is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements. The Bank is required to invest in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity.

Table of Contents

At December 31, 2017, the amount available for additional FHLB and Federal Reserve borrowings was approximately $14.7 billion, compared with $17.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Loans with a carrying value of approximately $25.6 billion at December 31, 2017 have been pledged at the FHLB of Des Moines and the Federal Reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with $24.0 billion at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, we had $3.6 billion of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding and no long-term FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding, compared with $500 million of short-term FHLB borrowings and no long-term FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, our total investment in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock was $154 million and $184 million, respectively, compared with $30 million and $181 million at December 31, 2016. Our increased investment in FHLB stock was a result of our increase in short-term FHLB borrowings during 2017.
Our investment activities can provide or use cash, depending on the asset-liability management posture taken. During 2017, HTM & AFS investment securities’ activities resulted in a net increase in investment securities and a net $2.2 billion decrease in cash compared with a net $5.9 billion decrease in cash for 2016.
Maturing balances in our subsidiary bank’s loan portfolios also provide additional flexibility in managing cash flows. Lending activity for both 2017 and 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow of $2.1 billion.
During 2017, we paid income taxes of $246 million, compared to $214 million during 2016.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. In our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk, we have an ERM department whose responsibility is to help employees, management and the Board of Directors to assess, understand, measure, manage, and monitor risk in accordance with our Risk Appetite Framework. We have documented both controls and the Control Self-Assessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and the FDICIA.
To manage and minimize our operational risk, we have in place transactional documentation requirements; systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions; systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud, penetrate our systems or telecommunications, access customer data, and/or deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers; regulatory compliance reviews; and periodic reviews by the Company’s Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and Credit Examination departments. Reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data. In addition, the Data Governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability. Further, we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters. We also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance, including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance.
We are continually improving our oversight of operational risk, including enhancement of risk identification, risk and control self-assessments, and antifraud measures, which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the ROC. Key measures have been established to increase oversight by ERM and Operational Risk Management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews, enhancements to the Enterprise Procurement and Third Party Risk Management framework, enhancements to the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery programs and Enterprise Security programs, and the establishment of Fraud Risk Oversight, Incident Response Oversight and Technology Project Oversight programs. Significant enhancements have also been made to governance, technology, and reporting, including the establishment of Policy and Committee Governance programs, the implementation of a governance, risk and control solution, and the creation of an Enterprise Risk Profile and an Operational Risk Profile along with business line risk profiles. In addition, the establishment of an Enterprise Exam Management department has standardized our response and reporting, and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examinations, communications and issues management.

The number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems, sometimes referred to as hacking, cyber fraud, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism, or other similar names, also continue to grow. Given the importance and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, the Company has designated cyber risk a level one risk in its risk taxonomy, which places it at the highest level of oversight with its other top risks.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Overview
The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management. The Board has established the Capital Management Committee (“CMC”), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and consisting of members of management, whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the Company and its subsidiary bank. Other major CMC responsibilities include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Setting overall capital targets within the Board-approved capital policy, monitoring performance compared to the Company’s Capital Policy limits, and recommending changes to capital including dividends, common stock repurchases, subordinated debt, and changes in major strategies to maintain the Company and its subsidiary bank at well-capitalized levels;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of its customers, and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding, consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders; and

- ----------------------------------------------------
• Reviewing agency ratings of the Company and ZB, N.A.

The Company has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior risk-adjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital. We believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence. Specifically, it is the policy of the Parent and ZB, N.A. to:

- -----------------------------------------------------
• Maintain sufficient capital to support current needs;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain an adequate capital cushion to withstand future adverse stress events while continuing to meet borrowing needs of its customers; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Meet fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock so as to be consistent with Federal Reserve guidelines SR 09-04 and 12 U.S.C §§ 56 and 60.

Capital Planning and Stress Testing
The CMC oversees the Company’s capital stress testing under a variety of adverse economic and market scenarios. We have established processes to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the Company under hypothetical economic scenarios. These stress tests facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity within quantitative limits reflecting the Board of Directors’ risk appetite. These processes are also used to complete the Company’s DFAST as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and HCR/CCAR as required by the Federal Reserve.
Filing a capital plan with the Federal Reserve based on stress testing and documented sound policies, processes, models, controls, and governance practices, and the subsequent review by the Federal Reserve, is an annual regulatory requirement. This capital plan, which is subject to objection by the Federal Reserve, governs all of the Company’s capital and significant unsecured debt financing actions for a period of five quarters. Among the actions governed by the capital plan are the repurchase of outstanding capital securities and the timing of new capital issuances, and whether the Company can pay or increase dividends. Any such action not included in a capital plan to which the Federal Reserve has not objected cannot be executed without submission of a revised stress test and capital plan for Federal Reserve review and non-objection; de minimis changes are allowed without a complete plan resubmission, subject to receipt of a Federal Reserve non-objection. Regulations require Company disclosure of these stress tests results.

77

Table of Contents

As a bank holding company with assets greater than $50 billion, we are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to participate in annual stress tests known as the DFAST. In addition, we are required to participate in the Federal Reserve Board’s annual HCR/CCAR for large and non-complex firms (generally, bank holding companies, with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion). In our capital plan, we are required to forecast, under a variety of economic scenarios, our estimated regulatory capital ratios and our GAAP tangible common equity ratio.
A detailed discussion of HCR/CCAR/DFAST requirements is contained on page 11 of the “Capital Plan and Stress Testing” section under Part 1, Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We submitted our stress test results and 2017 capital plan to the FRB on April 5, 2017. On June 28, 2017, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System notified Zions Bancorporation that the Federal Reserve does not object to Zions Bancorporation’s Board-approved 2017 capital plan. Our capital plan for the period spanning July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 includes up to $465 million of common stock repurchases and approximately $140 million of common stock dividends as follows.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increasing the quarterly common dividend to $0.24 per share by the second quarter of 2018 following the path of:

- --------------------------------------------
◦ $0.12 per share in the third quarter of 2017

- ---------------------------------------------
◦ $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017

- --------------------------------------------
◦ $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018

- ---------------------------------------------
◦ $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2018

Capital actions are subject to final approval by Zions Bancorporation’s board of directors, and may be influenced by, among other things, actual earnings performance, business needs and prevailing economic conditions.
On June 22, 2017, we filed a Form 8-K presenting the results of the 2017 DFAST exercise. The results of Zions’ published stress tests demonstrate that the Company believes it has sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn. Detailed disclosure of the stress test results can be found on our website.
On June 29, 2016, we filed a Form 8-K announcing that the FRB did not object to our 2016 capital plan (which spans the timeframe of July 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017). The plan included (1) the increase of the quarterly common dividend to $0.08 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016, (2) up to $180 million in total repurchases of common equity and (3) up to $144 million in total repurchases of preferred equity.
As planned, our quarterly dividend on common stock increased to $0.16 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has repurchased $230 million of its common stock at an average price of $47.42 per share under the 2017 capital plan and $180 million of its common stock at an average price of $35.66 per share under the 2016 capital plan.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased an additional $115 million of its common stock at an average price of $53.46 per share, leaving $120 million of repurchase capacity remaining in the 2017 capital plan (which spans the timeframe of July 2017 to June 2018).
Also in accordance with our 2016 capital plan, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our 7.9% Series F preferred stock on the redemption date of June 15, 2017.
Basel III
In 2013, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC published final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III capital rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 and were subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components. In November 2017, the FRB, FDIC and OCC published a final rule for non-advanced approaches banks that extends the regulatory capital

treatment applicable during 2017 under the regulatory capital rules for certain items. We met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as of December 31, 2017.
A detailed discussion of Basel III requirements, including implications for the Company, is contained on page 10 of the “Capital Standards – Basel Framework” section under Part 1, Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital Management Actions
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $45 million to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2017 from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in total shareholders’ equity is primarily due to net income of $592 million. This increase is partially offset by repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program totaling $320 million, $144 million paid to redeem our Series F preferred stock, and common and preferred dividends of $129 million.
During the latter part of 2016 and throughout 2017, the market price of our common stock increased above the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock. As of December 31, 2017 we have 29.3 million common stock warrants at an exercise price of $35.37 which expire on May 22, 2020 and 5.8 million common stock warrants at an exercise price of $36.27 per share which expire on November 14, 2018. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our common stock warrants. The increase in the market price of our common stock increased our diluted shares throughout 2017 and for the fourth quarter of 2016, but did not effect on our diluted shares for the full 2016 year.
Between January 1, 2018 and February 20, 2018, 1.0 million shares of common stock were issued from the cashless exercise of 3.2 million common stock warrants which expire on November 14, 2018. After these common stock warrant exercises, 29.3 million and 2.6 million common stock warrants, which expire on May 22, 2020 and November 14, 2018, respectively, remain outstanding.
Schedule 32 presents the diluted shares from the remaining common stock warrants at various Zions Bancorporation common stock market prices as of February 20, 2018, excluding the effect of changes in exercise cost and warrant share multiplier from the future payment of common stock dividends.

The common dividend rate was increased to $0.16 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017. We paid $89 million in dividends on common stock during 2017, compared to $58 million during 2016. During its January 2018 meeting, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per common share payable on February 22, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2018.
We paid preferred stock dividends of $40 million and $50 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also recorded a reductions of $2 million and $10 million to net earnings applicable to common shareholders as a result of the preferred stock redemptions during 2017 and 2016.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. Discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the Company’s financial statements. These critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements. Any changes to these amounts, including changes in estimates, may also be significant to the financial statements. We believe that an understanding of these policies, along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the Company, is important to have a complete picture of the Company’s financial condition. In addition, in arriving at these estimates, we are required to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include a high degree of uncertainty. The following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies. We have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We have included, where applicable in this document, sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions. The sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution. Changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation, as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions, which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Fair Value Estimates
We measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP has established a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among (1) observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets, (2) inputs

80

Table of Contents

other than quoted prices with observable market data, and (3) unobservable data such as the Company’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes.
When observable market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis. These modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, the life of the asset and applicable growth rate, the risk of nonperformance, and other related assumptions.
The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, the Company’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. In certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, the Company is required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. The models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.
Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, the Company uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including HTM securities, loans held for sale, and OREO) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.
Impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed.
Investment securities are valued using several methodologies, which depend on the nature of the security, availability of current market information, and other factors. Investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). OTTI is considered to have occurred if the instrument’s fair value is below its amortized cost and (1) we intend to sell the security, or (2) it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. The “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion.
Notes 1, 5, 7, 9, and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Investment Securities Portfolio” on page 50 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL includes the ALLL and the RULC. The ALLL represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios. This process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, as well as a qualitative review of the results. The qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment, and is described in more detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

81

Table of Contents

The RULC provides for potential losses associated with off-balance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit. The reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the ALLL, plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn.
Although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses, the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change. Any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of credit-related events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses. As an example, if the probability of default risk grade for all pass-graded commercial and CRE loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk grading scale, the quantitatively determined amount of the ALLL at December 31, 2017 would increase by approximately $105 million. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate.
Although the qualitative process is subjective, it represents the Company’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the ACL. We believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the ACL, the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate.
Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Credit Risk Management” on page 56 contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the ACL.
Accounting for Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. We perform this annual test as of September 30 of each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit (generally one of our banking segments) compares its fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount, if any, by which goodwill is impaired.
To determine the fair value, we use a combination of up to three separate methods: comparable publicly-traded financial service companies (primarily banks and bank holding companies) in the western and southwestern states (“Market Value”); where applicable, comparable acquisitions of financial services companies in the western and southwestern states (“Transaction Value”); and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• selection of comparable publicly-traded companies based on location, size, and business focus and composition;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• selection of market comparable acquisition transactions based on location, size, business focus and composition, and date of the transaction;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the discount rate, which is based on Zions’ estimate of its cost of capital, applied to future cash flows;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described; and

- ----------------------------------------------------
• the control premium associated with reporting units.

We apply a control premium in the Market Value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values. Control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the Company is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization. Based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the Company’s geographic footprint, and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value, we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0% to 15% for the reporting units was appropriate at the most recent test date.
Since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations, changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount. Estimates include economic conditions, which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates, and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions, including Federal Reserve

82

Table of Contents

monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes. Additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, loan losses, changes in growth trends, cost structures and technology, changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations, and changes in industry conditions.
Weakening in the economic environment, a decline in the performance of the reporting units, or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Company’s regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio, or liquidity position.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization, effective September 30, 2017. We concluded that none of our reporting units was impaired. Furthermore, the evaluation process determined that the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank exceeded their carrying values by 35%, 54%, and 78%, respectively. Additionally, we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption. If the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100bps, the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank would exceed their carrying values by 33%, 52%, and 72%, respectively.
Income Taxes
We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business. These laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. Calculation of the provision for income taxes requires significant judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations. Management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of these tax laws as we prepare the Company’s tax returns. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), was signed into law. The Act makes significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. In conjunction with the enactment of the Act, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act that may not be complete by the time financial statements are issued. The Company evaluated all available information and made reasonable estimates of the impact of the Act to substantially all components of its net DTA. The provisional impact of the Act on the net DTA resulted in a non-cash charge of $47 million, recorded through income tax expense. The Company anticipates that additional adjustments to net DTA and income tax expense may be made in 2018 as the Company’s initial determination of the tax basis of deferred items such as foregone interest, equity investments in flow-through entities, certain employee compensation arrangements, FDIC-supported transactions and premises and equipment are finalized. These adjustments will be recorded in the financial statements in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined; however, SAB 118 requires all impacts from the Act to be recorded prior to December 22, 2018, which is one year from the enactment date of the Act.
In 2017, the Company early adopted the guidance in ASU 2018-02, which allows reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects related to the change in the corporate income tax rate from the Act. The early adoption of the guidance resulted in a $25 million increase to retained earnings out of AOCI as of December 31, 2017.
We had net DTAs of $93 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $250 million at December 31, 2016. The most significant portions of the deductible temporary differences relate to (1) the ALLL, (2) fair value adjustments or impairment write-downs related to securities, (3) pension and postretirement obligations, and (4) deferred compensation arrangements. No valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2017 related to DTAs except for a full valuation reserve related to certain acquired net operating losses from an immaterial nonbank

subsidiary. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, both the positive and negative evidence about the realization of DTAs were evaluated. The ultimate realization of DTAs is based on the Company’s ability to (1) carry back net operating losses to prior tax periods, (2) utilize the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences, (3) implement tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible, and (4) generate future taxable income.
After considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, management has concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the existing DTAs and that an additional valuation allowance is not needed.
On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also reassessed on a regular basis. Reserves for contingent tax liabilities are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits. We have tax reserves at December 31, 2017 of approximately $5 million, net of federal and/or state benefits, primarily relating to uncertain tax positions for tax credits on technology initiatives.
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional information regarding income taxes.

Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
