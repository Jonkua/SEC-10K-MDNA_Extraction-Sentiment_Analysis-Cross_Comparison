Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HIGHLIGHTS

Sales increased 5% in 2017, from growth in volume, raw material-related price inflation and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales but were offset by divestitures (-2%). Sales growth came primarily from Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, and Adjustable Bed. Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, contributed to sales growth this past year.

Earnings from continuing operations decreased significantly from the effects of one-time costs associated with the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Other significant factors that reduced earnings include on going steel inflation and the timing lag associated with passing along higher steel costs. These reductions were partially offset by increased sales and lower income taxes.

We continue to optimize our portfolio by increasing investment in those businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. We increased capital expenditures in 2017 to support product categories that are growing. In addition, we acquired three small businesses. We also divested the last remaining operation within the Commercial Vehicle Products group during the year.

Operating cash flow decreased versus 2016, primarily from higher working capital due to sales growth and inflation. However, we once again generated more than enough operating cash flow to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we have accomplished each year for more than 25 years.

We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% in 2017 and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. We also bought back 3.3 million shares of our stock.

During the year, we issued $500 million of 3.5% notes maturing in 2027. We also extended the term of, and expanded the borrowing capacity under, our revolving credit facility from $750 million to $800 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program. We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital at 33%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 47.

We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. We target TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term. For the three years ended December 31, 2017, we generated TSR of 7% per year on average, placing us just below the midpoint of the S&P 500.

These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.

INTRODUCTION

Total Shareholder Return

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay: TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price. We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term through an approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.

We monitor our TSR performance relative to the S&P 500 on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2017, we generated TSR of 7% per year on average, just below the midpoint of the S&P 500.

The table below shows the components of our TSR targets. Accomplishing this level of performance over rolling three-year periods should enable us to consistently attain our top-third TSR goal.

Customers

We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 5% of our sales. Many are companies whose names are widely recognized. They include producers of residential furniture and bedding, automotive and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.

Major Factors That Impact Our Business

Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.

Market Demand

Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant. Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales.

Raw Material Costs

In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod. This is a benefit that our competitors do not have. We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials. Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.

28

Table of Contents
PART II

We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers. The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, and we also realize a lag as costs decline.

Steel is our principal raw material. At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity. In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments. Throughout 2015, market prices for steel decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices. We realized a beneficial pricing lag during 2015, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices. In 2016, steel costs once again became volatile. Steel inflation during the first half of 2016 was followed by deflation in the third quarter, and significant inflation late in the year. This steel inflation continued throughout 2017. We implemented price increases to recover most of the higher costs, but with the normal lag in realizing selling price increases, the cost inflation led to margin pressure throughout 2017.

As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile in past years, were moderately compressed in late 2016, and began to increase modestly in the second half of 2017.

Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals. We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in past years and generally have been able to pass them through to our customers.

When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components. We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality of their products and manage their costs, while providing higher profits for our operations.

Competition

Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price. Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering innovation, better product quality, and customer service.

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive in most of our business units, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%. In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued. In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).

An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the imposition of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod. The

29

Table of Contents
PART II

antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%. Both remain in effect through December 2019.  Also, in March 2017 certain U.S. steel wire rod producers filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on imports of steel wire rod from Belarus, Italy, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The ITC and the DOC have made final affirmative determinations and imposed antidumping duties on imports from Belarus (280%), Russia (437% to 757%), South Africa (135% to 142%), Ukraine (35% to 44%), and United Arab Emirates (84%). Final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on the remaining countries are expected in March and April 2018.

Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett and several other U.S. manufacturers formed a coalition to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.  As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act.  The ENFORCE Act requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.

Change in Segment Reporting in 2017

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. In conjunction with a change in executive officers, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed as of January 1, 2017. Effective January 1, 2017, Perry E. Davis became President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments, and J. Mitchell Dolloff became President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments.

The composition of our four segments also changed effective January 1, 2017. The table below outlines the new segment structure. We reported under this new structure when we filed our 2017 first quarter 10-Q.

----------------------------- ------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------

Residential Products Industrial Products Furniture Products Specialized Products

Bedding Group Wire Group Work Furniture Group Automotive Group
Fabric & Carpet Cushion Group Home Furniture Group Aerospace Products Group
Machinery Group Consumer Products Group CVP Group

The new structure is largely the same as in prior years except that the Home Furniture Group was moved from Residential Products (formerly Residential Furnishings) to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products), and the Machinery Group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. The Industrial Products segment (formerly Industrial Materials) had no changes. Our final CVP operation was sold in 2017.

Prior to January 1, 2017, all of our segments used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory. In our consolidated financials, we converted approximately 50% of these inventories (primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories) to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and reported the related LIFO benefit or expense outside of the segments.  Effective January 1, 2017, the LIFO benefit or expense was recognized within the segment to which it relates.  This change has been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2017 vs. 2016

Sales increased 5% in 2017, from growth in volume, raw material-related price inflation, and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales but were offset by divestitures. Sales growth came primarily from Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, and Adjustable Bed. Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, contributed to sales growth this year.

Earnings from continuing operations decreased significantly from the effects of one-time costs associated with the recently enacted TCJA. Other significant factors that reduced earnings include ongoing steel inflation and the timing lag associated with passing along higher steel costs. These reductions were partially offset by increased sales and lower income taxes. Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Sales increased 5% from volume growth, raw-material price increases and currency impact. Acquisitions also contributed 2% to sales growth but were offset by divestitures. The growth came primarily from Automotive and Adjustable Bed. Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, also contributed to sales growth this past year.

During 2017, we divested the last remaining CVP operation, which had total annual sales of $43 million.

As indicated in the table above, earnings from continuing operations decreased primarily from the impact of the recently enacted TCJA. Operationally, earnings decreased largely from steel inflation, the timing lag associated with passing along these higher steel costs, and several smaller items partially offset by higher volume and lower income taxes.

LIFO Impact

Approximately 50% of our inventories are valued on the LIFO method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In 2017, increasing steel costs over the course of the year resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $19 million. In 2016, increasing steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $11 million.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2017 did not appreciably change.

Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.  Recurring items include income earned in various tax jurisdictions and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.  These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.  Conversely, discrete items may not be as consistent from year to year.

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law TCJA, enacting significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the transition of U.S. taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and the imposition of a one-time tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of untaxed foreign earnings. Although these provisions are generally applicable for years after December 31, 2017, several impacted our 2017 earnings, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax, additional taxes for expected foreign cash repatriations, and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred taxes. As a result, we recorded a net tax expense of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to these items, which negatively impacted our full year tax rate by 12%. Of this total amount, $67 million is related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax that will be paid on a graduated scale over the next eight years.

 The amount recorded is our best estimate and based on our current understanding of TCJA and the guidance currently available, but should be considered provisional. The ultimate impact may differ from the provisional amount and the accounting will be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 32% in 2017, compared to 25% for 2016.  As discussed above, our rate was negatively impacted by 12% in 2017 due to the effect of TCJA (16% associated with the deemed repatriation tax and 2% from tax on expected future foreign cash repatriations, partially offset by a 6% benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities). In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 8% in 2017 and 6% in 2016.  In addition, the 2017 tax rate benefited by 2% related to tax attributes from a divested business, 2% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year, and 3% from other permanent tax differences.

32

Table of Contents
PART II

 The 2016 tax rate benefited by 3% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year and 1% (net) from other items.

We anticipate an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22%, which includes the anticipated tax effects associated with TCJA and certain other expected discrete items, including stock compensation payments. The expected tax impact from stock compensation can fluctuate based on stock price and other factors, and any changes to our 2017 provisional and 2018 expected TCJA amounts could impact our anticipated 2018 tax rate. Our tax rate is also contingent upon other factors such as our overall profitability, the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, the type of income earned, business acquisitions and dispositions, the impact of tax audits and other discrete items, and the effect of other tax law changes and prudent tax planning strategies.

(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales. Overall company margin is calculated on trade sales.

Residential Products

Residential Products total sales increased 3% in 2017 from acquisitions, net of a small divestiture. Same locations sales were flat, with volume growth and raw material-related price increases offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds (which originate in Furniture Products but are occasionally distributed through Residential Products). Within our U.S. Spring business, total innerspring units decreased 4%, but growth continued in ComfortCore® (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that category up 8%. Volume also increased in our International Spring business.

EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2017 due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases and higher volume, despite the non-recurrence of a $7 million litigation benefit in 2016.

34

Table of Contents
PART II

Industrial Products

Total sales in the segment declined 6%, due to divestitures completed in 2016. Same location sales in Industrial Products were flat with steel-related price increases offset by lower volume.

EBIT decreased primarily from the non-recurrence of a $16 million divestiture gain in 2016, higher raw material costs (including LIFO expense), the timing lag associated with passing along inflation, an impairment charge of $5 million, and lower volume.

Furniture Products

Sales in Furniture Products increased 6%, with same location sales up 5% from growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture. A small acquisition in Work Furniture added 1% to sales growth.

EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, with the benefit from sales growth more than offset by higher steel costs (including LIFO expense), production inefficiencies and other smaller items.

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, total sales increased 4% in 2017, and same location sales increased 8%, with volume gains in Automotive and Aerospace partially offset by lower sales in the former CVP business unit. CVP divestitures reduced sales by 4%.

EBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from a $23 million gain related to the sale of real estate formerly associated with CVP and higher volume, partially offset by a non-recurring divestiture gain in 2016 ($11 million) and growth-related costs.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to -$1 million from $19 million in 2016. This decrease is primarily due to the non-recurrence of a litigation gain ($20 million) related to our former Prime Foam business. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2016 vs. 2015

Sales decreased 4% in 2016, with slightly higher unit volume and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price deflation, and currency impact. Sales growth continued in Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, but several other businesses experienced soft market demand and lower unit volume during the year.

Earnings from continuing operations increased from several factors, including divestiture gains. The benefit from increased unit volume and lower income taxes was partially offset by steel inflation and the non-recurrence of a pricing lag benefit associated with deflation late in 2015. Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.

Sales decreased 4%, with unit volume growth and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact. Strong growth in Automotive was partially offset by soft demand in several other markets, including bedding and home furniture.

During 2016, we divested two wire operations, a CVP business and a Machinery operation. These businesses had total combined annual sales of approximately $100 million.

As indicated in the table above, earnings from continuing operations increased from divestiture gains (related to a CVP business and a wire operation), a litigation settlement gain, and the non-recurrence of the prior year's

pension settlement charge. Operationally, earnings also benefited from higher unit volume and lower income taxes related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. These improvements were partially offset by steel inflation that began to occur in late 2016 and the non-recurrence of the prior year pricing lag benefit (that occurred as steel costs deflated in late 2015).

LIFO Impact

Approximately 50% of our inventories are valued on the LIFO method. These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories. In 2016, increasing steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $11 million. In 2015, significant deflation in steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.

For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

Interest and Income Taxes

Net interest expense in 2016 decreased slightly due to the repayment of $200 million 5% notes in August 2015.

Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.  Recurring items include things like income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.  These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.  Conversely, discrete items are things that may not be as consistent from year to year.

While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 25% in 2016, compared to 27% for 2015.  In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6% in each year.  In addition, the 2016 tax rate benefited by 3% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year, and 1% (net) from other items.  The 2015 tax rate benefited by 1% related to the reduction of a tax accrual for Chinese earnings that we decided to reinvest within China to acquire the remaining interest in a joint venture and 1% (net) from other items.

In the first quarter of 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU provides that the tax effects of stock-based awards must be treated as discrete items affecting the tax rate in the interim reporting period in which the tax deductions occur.  Many variables (such as timing of award settlements or expirations, changes in stock price over time, ultimate payout levels for awards with performance contingencies, shares cancelled before vesting, and the tax rules in effect at the time of settlement) will impact both the timing and the amount of the tax deductions.  Thus, this ASU is likely to add more volatility to the effective tax rate of companies such as Leggett that use stock-based compensation plans.

Residential Products

Residential Products sales decreased 6% in 2016 from a combination of lower unit volume in several product categories, lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds (which originate in Furniture Products but are occasionally distributed through Residential Products), raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact. Within our U.S. Spring business, total innerspring units decreased 6%, but growth continued in ComfortCore® (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that category up 4%. Volume also increased in our European Spring business.

EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2016 due to a litigation gain ($7 million) and non-recurrence of last year's foam litigation expense ($5 million). Operationally, the impact on EBIT from lower unit volume was offset by pricing discipline.

PART II

Industrial Products

Same location sales in Industrial Products were down 12% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire. Total sales in the segment declined 25%, also reflecting the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015 and two wire operations in 2016.

EBIT decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs (including LIFO impact) and lower unit volume. The operational impacts were partially offset by a divestiture gain ($16 million) from the sale of one of the Wire Products operations, and the non-recurrence of the prior year's impairment charge ($6 million) and divestiture loss ($3 million), both associated with the sale of the Steel Tubing business.

Furniture Products

Sales in Furniture Products decreased 2%, primarily from lower volume in Home Furniture, steel-related price decreases, and currency impact. These items were partially offset by growth from a Work Furniture acquisition completed in March 2015. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 1% (versus strong growth in each of the prior two years) as we began ramping up new programs selling directly to major bedding retailers and transitioning away from former programs with bedding manufacturers. The decline in these bedding manufacturer programs also caused the decrease in pass-through sales of adjustable beds discussed in the Residential Products segment above.

EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from higher raw material costs (including LIFO impact) and lower volume, partially offset by operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million, and a favorable sales mix.

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, sales increased 7% in 2016, with volume gains in Automotive and an Aerospace acquisition completed early in the year, partially offset by divestitures, and currency impact.

EBIT and EBIT margin increased from higher sales, a divestiture gain ($11 million) related to the sale of a CVP operation, and currency impact. These items were partially offset by goodwill impairment of $4 million.

We agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP business and expected to realize a gain on this transaction in 2017. This property reached held-for-sale status in 2016, causing the fair value of the CVP reporting unit to fall below its carrying value, and triggering the $4 million impairment charge.

Results from Discontinued Operations

Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $19 million from $1 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to a litigation gain ($20 million) related to our former Prime Foam business. For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77.

PART II

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

Cash from operations decreased in 2017, primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation. Our operations once again provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments, something we have accomplished each year for over 25 years. We expect this to again be the case in 2018.

We continued to invest in businesses and product categories that are growing. This resulted in higher capital expenditures in 2017. We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. We also bought back 3.3 million shares of our stock during the year.

In November 2017, we issued $500 million of 3.5% notes maturing in 2027. We also extended the term of our revolving credit facility to November 2022, expanded the borrowing capacity from $750 million to $800 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program. We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital at 33%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 47.

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.

Cash from operations decreased in 2017 primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation. Cash from operations should approximate $500 million in 2018, with working capital expected to be a smaller use of cash than in 2017.

PART II

We closely monitor our working capital levels, and we ended 2017 with adjusted working capital at 10.6% of annualized sales1. The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation. We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and performance related to trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable. We believe this provides a more useful measurement to investors since cash and current maturities can fluctuate significantly from period to period. As discussed on page 48, a substantial amount of our cash is held by international operations and may not be immediately available to reduce debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales 10.6 % 9.4 %

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($984 million in 2017 and $904 million in 2016) multiplied by 4. We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.

PART II

Trade Receivables - Our trade receivables increased $71 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased sales and currency fluctuations. Our sales to international customers, which are predominantly in the Specialized Products segment, continue to increase and typically have longer payment terms. We continue to look for ways to improve speed of customer payments, including third party programs with early payment incentives in certain circumstances.

Our provision for losses on accounts receivable has averaged $2 million, and our allowance for bad debt as a percentage of our net receivables has averaged 2% for the last three years. We have experienced favorable trends in the number of accounts monitored for possible loss or written off in the last few years. We obtain credit applications, credit reports, bank and trade references, and periodic financial statements from our customers to establish credit limits and terms as appropriate. In cases where a customer’s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary.

Inventories - The increase in inventories of $51 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher levels necessary to support sales growth and meet customer delivery requirements, and higher raw material costs.

Days inventory on hand of 65 days at the end of 2017 is within a reasonable historical range. We believe we have established adequate reserves for any slower moving or obsolete inventories. We continuously monitor our slow-moving and potentially obsolete inventory through reports on inventory quantities compared to usage within the previous 120 days. We also utilize cycle counting programs and complete physical counts of our inventory. When potential inventory obsolescence is indicated by these controls, we will take charges for write-downs to maintain an adequate level of reserves. We have averaged inventory obsolescence charges of $8 million annually for the last three years. Our reserve balances (not including our LIFO reserves) as a percentage of our year-end inventory were 6% at the end of 2017, which is consistent with our historical average.

Accounts Payable - The increase in accounts payables of $79 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased purchases to support sales growth, a focused effort on optimizing payment terms, and currency fluctuations. We continue to optimize payment terms through our significant purchasing power and also utilize third party services that allow flexible payment options to enhance our DPO.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Cash is readily available to fund growth.

In certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess production capacity, and we are therefore investing to support continued growth. In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production over the next few years. In Bedding, we are investing in equipment to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore® innersprings and newer product features such as Quantum® Edge. We are also investing to support rapid growth in Adjustable Bed.

We will continue to make investments to support expansion in businesses and product lines where sales are growing, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. We expect capital expenditures to again approximate $160 million in 2018. Our employee incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis focuses our management on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.

In some of our businesses, we have capacity to accommodate additional volume. For each $10 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million of additional pretax earnings. The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, higher utilization in our businesses from market share gains and higher market demand.

Our long-term 6-9% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our Grow business units, and we are looking for opportunities to enter new growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
In 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for an initial cash outlay of $12 million and will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in the second quarters of 2018 and 2020, respectively, for a currently estimated amount of $14 million. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.

In 2016, we acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $65 million. The first, a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, expands our tube forming and fabrication

capabilities and adds precision machining to our aerospace platform. The second is a distributor of geosynthetic products, and the third, a South African producer of mattress innersprings. Finally, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China. This business manufactures seat comfort products and lumbar support systems.

In 2017, we acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $56 million (cash and stock). The first, a Canadian distributor and installer of geosynthetic products expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a U.S. manufacturer of surface-critical bent tube components which supports the private-label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business. The third is a U.S. producer of rebond carpet underlay which adds to our production capacity and expands the geographic footprint in our Carpet Cushion business. Finally, we acquired the remaining 20% of an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business.

Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 110.

Pay Dividends

Increasing the dividend remains a high priority. In 2017, we increased the quarterly dividend by $.02, or 6%, to $.36 per share. This extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 46 years. Our targeted dividend payout ratio is 50-60% of continuing operations adjusted EPS (which exclude special items such as significant tax law impacts, divestiture gains, impairment charges, litigation accruals and settlement proceeds). We expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.

44

Table of Contents
PART II

Repurchase Stock

As shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years. During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 12.1 million shares of our stock and issued 6.2 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 4%. In 2017, we repurchased 3.3 million shares (at an average price of $48.66) and issued 1.7 million shares.

Our top priorities for uses of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, to the extent there is remaining cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock. We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.

(2) The unused credit amount is based upon our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program which, at the end of 2015, had $600 million of borrowing capacity. The credit facility was amended in the second quarter of 2016 to increase the borrowing capacity to $750 million and the commercial paper program was increased to a corresponding amount. The credit facility was amended again in the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase the borrowing capacity to $800 million and the commercial paper program was increased to a corresponding amount.

The next table shows the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016, calculated in two ways:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted (non-GAAP) measures as supplemental information to track leverage trends across time periods with variable levels of cash. Our long-term target is to have net debt as a percentage of net capital in the 30-40% range. As discussed on page 48, a substantial amount of cash is held by our international operations. Therefore, we may not be able to use all of our cash to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as reflected in the net debt to net capital ratio.

-------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- - -----

(Dollar amounts in millions) 2017 2016
Long-term debt $ 1,098 $ 956
Current debt maturities 154 4
Cash and cash equivalents (526 ) (282 )
Net debt $ 726 $ 678
Total capitalization $ 2,575 $ 2,277
Current debt maturities 154 4
Cash and cash equivalents (526 ) (282 )
Net capitalization $ 2,203 $ 1,999
Long-term debt to total capitalization 42.6 % 42.0 %
Net debt to net capitalization 33.0 % 33.9 %

Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $292 million in 2017, primarily from the $500 million debt issuance described below, partially offset by a reduction in commercial paper.

In November 2017, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes that mature in 2027. The notes bear interest at a rate of 3.5% per year, with interest payable semi-annually beginning on May 15, 2018. The net proceeds of these notes were used to pay down commercial paper, which in turn provided borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes and the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness, at maturity.

PART II

Short Term Borrowings

We can raise cash by issuing commercial paper through a program that is backed by our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 14 lenders. In May 2016, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from $600 million to $750 million and extended the term by two years to 2021. In November 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from $750 million to $800 million and extended the term by one year to 2022. The credit facility allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million. When we issue letters of credit under the facility, we reduce our available credit and commercial paper capacity by a corresponding amount. Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:

----------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- ---- ---- --- ---- - - ---

(Dollar amounts in millions) 2017 2016 2015
Total program authorized $ 800 $ 750 $ 600
Commercial paper outstanding (classified as long-term debt) — (196 ) (181 )
Letters of credit issued under the credit facility — — —
Total program usage — (196 ) (181 )
Total program available $ 800 $ 554 $ 419

The average and maximum amounts of commercial paper outstanding during 2017 were $436 million and $625 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $309 million and $625 million, respectively. At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, but we had issued $51 million of stand-by letters of credit under other bank agreements to take advantage of better pricing.

With cash on hand, operating cash flow, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt (including $150 million of 4.4% notes due July 1, 2018), as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.

Our revolving credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations contain restrictive covenants. Based upon our planned use of cash, we could utilize the full $800 million of commercial paper, and we would expect to remain in compliance with all of the covenants. The covenants limit, among other things: a) our total amount of indebtedness to 65% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit facility), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of all or substantially all of total consolidated assets. For more information about long-term debt, please see Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91.

Accessibility of Cash

At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $526 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Over 80% of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations. We do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing U.S. liquidity needs. During 2018, we expect to repatriate approximately $300 million of foreign cash. The timing and exact amounts of these cash repatriations are difficult to predict, and are, among other things, subject to local governmental requirements.

As discussed previously, TCJA enacted at the end of 2017 imposed a one-time U.S. tax on the earnings that produced our foreign cash. This deemed repatriation tax totaled $67 million and will be paid on a graduated scale over the next eight years. We can now bring cash to the U.S. without incurring incremental U.S. federal taxes. There likely will be some state-level income tax; however, we believe any such tax will not be material. As a result, the enactment of TCJA increases the likelihood of repatriating cash from past, current and future foreign earnings.

PART II

 If we were to bring all our current foreign cash back immediately to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would pay previously accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $21 million, based upon historic foreign withholding tax rates. However, due to statutory requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $36 million of this cash was inaccessible for repatriation at year end. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we brought back cash of $116 million, $5 million, and $112 million, respectively, at little to no added tax cost.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures. If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant. Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate. Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.

“Critical accounting estimates” are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.

We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Description Judgments andUncertainties Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur. Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of June 30 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. We begin with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model. Judgment is required in the two step model to estimate fair value for the reporting unit. We estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance. Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio. Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit. The June 2017 review indicated no goodwill impairments. However, we exited a few small businesses in each of the years presented and evaluated goodwill for impairment when they were classified as held for sale. We recognized goodwill impairments of less than $5 million in each of the years presented, associated with the exit of these businesses. Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.At December 31, 2017, we had $822 million of goodwill. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible.

Description Judgments andUncertainties Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Other Long-lived Assets
Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level). Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely. Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets. For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets. These impairments are unpredictable. Impairments averaged approximately $2 million per year over the last three years.At December 31, 2017, net property, plant and equipment was $664 million and net intangible assets other than goodwill was $169 million.
Inventory Reserves
We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover). Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product. If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely. Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly).Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow-moving. The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow-moving based upon historical experience (65% on average). At December 31, 2017, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $35 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories). This is consistent with the $33 million of reserves at December 31, 2016 and 2015, representing 6% of FIFO inventories. Additions to inventory reserves in 2017 were $5 million, which were lower than 2016 and 2015 amounts of $9 million and $10 million, respectively. We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.

Workers’ Compensation
We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation. Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay. We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers. Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $8 million annually for costs associated with workers’ compensation. Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million. At December 31, 2017, we had accrued $34 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
Credit Losses .
For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible. When we become aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible. Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged. Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.In cases where a customer’s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary. Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency and/or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these customers. A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates. We believe we have established adequate reserves on our riskier customer accounts. We have experienced favorable trends in the number of accounts monitored for possible loss or written off in the last few years. The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was less than $2 million (significantly less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years. At December 31, 2017, our allowances for doubtful accounts were less than $5 million (about 1% of our trade accounts and notes receivable of $528 million).

Pension Accounting
For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.In 2017, we completed an annuity purchase transaction for pensioners that were currently receiving a small monthly benefit, and in 2015 offered a voluntary one-time lump-sum payment option to selected participants. Please see Note L to our Consolidated Financial Statements on page 99. The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management's judgment. Significant assumptions used to measure our pension liabilities and pension expense annually include: - the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future benefits - an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities) - certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality. Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date. These estimates are based on each plans' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances - the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans’ benefit obligation by $8 million.A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans’ funded status. Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
Contingencies
We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate. If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred and reasonably estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimate of the loss. Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable. Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded expense of $18 million ($13 million for continuing operations and $5 million in discontinued operations).There were no material uninsured individual claims during the three-year period ending December 31, 2017.

Description Judgments andUncertainties Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Income Taxes
In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time. These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements. Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns. Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain. Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which resulted in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law affecting the Company. Current and expected impacts are based on our current knowledge of the legislation and certain assumptions we have made. Please see Note M-Income Taxes on page 103 for more information. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $12 million and $26 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income. In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them. In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries. Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation. Changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue. Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience. The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations. We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary. However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense. Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

Accruals for Probable Losses
Although the Company denies liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- --- ---- ----- ---- --- ----- - - ----

 Twelve Months Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Litigation contingency accrual - Beginning of period $ 3.2 $ 8.1 $ 83.9
Adjustment to accruals - expense - Continuing operations .6 7.1 5.7
Adjustment to accruals - expense - Discontinued operations 1.6 2.0 .7
Cash payments (5.0 ) (14.0 ) (82.2 )
Litigation contingency accrual - End of period $ .4 $ 3.2 $ 8.1

 A large percentage of the accruals and cash payments in 2015 and 2016 were related to antitrust proceedings. The above litigation contingency accruals do not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, vehicle-related personal injury, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense. However, any litigation expense associated with these categories is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Note H - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements under "Accrued expenses" on page 90.
We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, and to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming or being substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals
Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current known facts, that additional losses, if any, are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, based upon current known facts, as of December 31, 2017, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore not accrued) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $22 million, including approximately $21 million for Brazilian VAT matters and $1 million for other matters. If our assumptions or analyses regarding these contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals, and even greater than our estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded accruals.
For more information regarding litigation contingencies, please refer to Note S on page 115 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Furniture Products

Sales in Furniture Products decreased 2%, primarily from lower volume in Home Furniture, steel-related price decreases, and currency impact. These items were partially offset by growth from a Work Furniture acquisition completed in March 2015. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 1% (versus strong growth in each of the prior two years) as we began ramping in pass-through sales of adjustable beds discussed in the Residential Products segment above.

EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from higher raw material costs (including LIFO impact) and lower volume, partially offset by operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million, and a favorable sales mix.

Specialized Products

In Specialized Products, sales increased 7% in 2016, with volume gains in Automotive and an Aerospace acquisition completed early in the year, partially offset by divestitures, and currency impact.

EBIT and EBIT margin increased from higher sales, a divestiture gain ($11 million) related to the sale of a CVP operation, and currency impact. These items were partially offset by goodwill impairment of $4 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION

Cash from operations decreased in 2017, primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation. Our case in 2018.

We continued to invest in businesses and product categories that are growing. This resulted in higher capital expenditures in 2017. We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. We also bought back 3.3 million shares of our stock during the year.

In November 2017, we issued $500 million of 3.5% notes maturing in 2027. We also extended the term of our revolving credit facility to November 2022, expanded the borrowing capacity from $750 million to $800 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program. We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital at 33%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 47.

Cash from Operations

Cash from operations is our primary source of funds. Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.

Cash from operations decreased in 2017 primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation. Cash from operations should approximate $500 million in 2018, with working capital expected to be a smaller use of cash than in 2017.

Trade Receivables programs with early payment incentives in certain circumstances.

Our provision for losses on accounts receivable has averaged $2 million, and our allowance for bad debt as a percentage of our net receivables credit reports, bank and trade references, and periodic financial statements from our customers to establish credit limits and terms as appropriate. In cases where a customer’s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary.

Inventories - The increase in inventories of $51 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher levels necessary to support sales growth and meet customer delivery requirements, and higher raw material costs.

Days inventory on hand of $8 million annually for the last three years. Our reserve balances (not including our LIFO reserves) as a percentage of our year-end inventory were 6% at the end of 2017, which is consistent with our historical average.

Accounts Payable - The increase in accounts payables of $79 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased purchases to support sales growth, flexible payment options to enhance our DPO.

Uses of Cash

Finance Capital Requirements

Cash is readily available to fund growth.

In certain of our businesses and product lines the next few years. In Bedding, we are investing in equipment to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore® innersprings and newer product features such as Quantum® Edge. We are also investing to support rapid growth in Adjustable Bed.

We will continue to make investments to support expansion in businesses and product lines where sales are growing, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. We expect management on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.

In some of our businesses, we have capacity to accommodate additional earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, higher utilization in our businesses from market share gains and higher market demand.

The next table shows the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016, calculated in two ways:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.

We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly. We use these adjusted (non-GAAP) measures as supplemental information to track leverage trends across time periods with operations. Therefore, we may not be able to use all of our cash to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as reflected in the net debt to net capital ratio.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

[' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances - the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans’ benefit obligation by $8 million.A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans’ funded status. Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
Contingencies
We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate. If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred and reasonably estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimate of the loss. Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable. Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded expense of $18 million ($13 million for continuing operations and $5 million in discontinued operations).There were no material uninsured individual claims during the three-year period ending December 31, 2017.

Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.

NOTE 25. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spin-Off of Delphi Technologies On December 4, 2017, the Company completed the Separation of its former Powertrain Systems segment by distributing to Aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ("Delphi Technologies"), a public limited company formed to hold the spun-off business. To effect the Separation, the Company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies for every three Aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of November 22, 2017, the record date for the distribution. Shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies. Following the Separation, Delphi Technologies is now an independent public company. Aptiv did not retain any equity or other interests in Delphi Technologies. On December 4, 2017, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company transferred to Delphi Technologies the assets and liabilities that comprised Delphi Technologies' business. The Company received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies in connection with the Separation. Delphi Technologies financed this dividend through the issuance of approximately $1.55 billion of debt, consisting of a senior secured five-year $750 million term loan facility that was issued upon the spin-off and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 that were issued in September 2017 (collectively, the "Delphi Technologies Debt"). In connection with the Separation, the Delphi Technologies Debt was transferred to Delphi Technologies and is no longer reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also in connection with the Separation, the Company received $180 million in cash from Delphi Technologies pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement. The requirements for the presentation of Delphi Technologies as a discontinued operation were met when the Se...
