EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") technology solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. As a leader in this industry, we deliver on our global HCM strategy and make investments in highly strategic areas and technology in order to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for continued growth.

Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• Worldwide new business bookings increased 8% to $1.8 billion

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue grew 8% in fiscal 2018; Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") decreased 5% to $3.66, while adjusted diluted EPS increased 18% to $4.35

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our shareholder friendly actions continued as we raised our quarterly declared cash dividend by 21% and returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Completed migrations of our mid-market clients to latest version of Workforce Now

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Executed on a VERP and created a Transformation Office to continue driving broad-based transformation initiatives

At ADP we innovate by anticipating how the world of work is transforming and how trends, such as the rising of the gig economy, impact the needs of our clients and the evolving workforce. We are reshaping the HCM industry through organic innovative development such as our next-gen platforms and our strategic acquisitions such as Global Cash Card, WorkMarket, and more recently, Celergo, Inc., a leading provider of international payroll management services. With these investments we are enhancing our position as the only global HCM provider that can help businesses address the entire worker spectrum from full-time to freelancer and hire to retire. As the payroll market continues to rapidly evolve, we continue to be focused on staying ahead of the curve. Through our investments in technology, service, and distribution, we intend to continue to build on our momentum heading into fiscal 2019.

Our new business bookings increased 8% during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, validating the renewed momentum in our sales force following fiscal 2017. We are confident that the investments in our sales force and products will continue to drive solid results. We remain optimistic in our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending June 30, 2019 ("fiscal 2019").

During fiscal 2018, we continued to migrate clients to our strategic platforms while making investments in R&D to provide best-in-class cloud-based HCM technology solutions to our clients. Employer Services retention was positively impacted by our focus on improving the client experience and was positively impacted by the loss of a large client within our former Consumer Health Spending Account ("CHSA") business during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"). This focus translated into strong retention on our strategic platforms and as a result, we saw Employer Services revenue retention improve 50 basis points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

Simultaneously, we continue to streamline our service organization. We remain focused on delivering results and executing on our strategy to transform our business for continued success within the competitive global HCM environment. During fiscal 2018, we incurred $20.5 million in charges for a previously announced multi-year Service Alignment Initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms. Building upon our Service Alignment Initiative in support of our transformation goals, we are executing upon a voluntary early retirement program and have also identified additional operational improvement initiatives through the formation of our Transformation Office. These transformation initiatives support ADP’s ongoing strategy which is aimed at streamlining our operations and extending our world class distribution while leveraging our talent and culture.

We have a strong business model and operate in a growing global market. We continue to maintain a high percentage of recurring revenues and healthy margins, and retain our ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2018, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.2 billion. We have benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") signed into law in late December 2017. With this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions, including assessing reinvestments into the business, potential acquisitions, and/or returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, among other potential uses.

Note 1. Non-GAAP measures

In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:

Adjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rate See footnote (g)
Constant Currency Basis U.S. GAAP P&L line items See footnote (h)

We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) Our Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations continues to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The

26

adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."

(b) The charges within transformation initiatives for fiscal 2018 includes $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP"), severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of $20.5 million, and other transformation initiatives of $47.2 million which primarily consist of severance charges totaling $41.9 million for fiscal 2018. Charges for transformation initiatives for periods prior to fiscal 2018 primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. Refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of charges associated with the VERP.

(c) Represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters.

(d) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.

(e) The tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, the gain on the sale of the assets, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.

(f) The one-time net provision from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is comprised of a one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, accrued foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earning and profit that may no longer be utilizable as foreign tax credits, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized offset by the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments.

(g) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.

(h) "Constant currency basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. "Constant currency basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

Total Revenues

Our revenues, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018. Our revenue growth includes two percentage points of combined benefit from foreign currency and acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses in fiscal 2017. Revenues in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services.

Total revenues in fiscal 2018 include interest on funds held for clients of $466.5 million, as compared to $397.4 million in fiscal 2017.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average interest rate earned to 1.9% in fiscal 2018, as compared to 1.7% in fiscal 2017, coupled with the increase in our average client funds balances of 5.7% to $24.3 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

Total Expenses

Our total expenses, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs, increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and increases in selling expense. Total expenses also increased due to costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018, the impact of foreign currency, and costs related to proxy contest matters in fiscal 2018.

27

Operating expenses, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,945.5 million for fiscal 2018, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,463.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $482.4 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018, higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue as well as the impact of foreign currency.

Systems development and programming costs, as reported, remained flat in fiscal 2018, when compared to the prior year, due to increased investments in product innovation and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, impact of foreign currency translation, offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  The increase was primarily due to increases in selling expense to support our 8% new business bookings growth, charges related to our transformation initiatives, costs related to acquisitions, costs related to proxy contest matters, and the impact of foreign currency translation, offset by charges related to our transformation initiatives in fiscal 2017.

Other Expense/(Income), net

Years ended June 30, 2018 2017 $ Change
Interest income on corporate funds $ (83.5 ) $ (76.7 ) $ 6.8
Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (2.0 ) (5.3 ) (3.3 )

Voluntary Early Retirement Program (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) 319.6 — (319.6 )
Other expense/(income), net $ 237.9 $ (284.3 ) $ (522.2 )

Other expense/(income), net, decreased $522.2 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a charge for certain special termination benefits for those associates who opted into the VERP of $319.6 million in fiscal 2018 and the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017.

Earnings before Income Taxes

Earnings before income taxes decreased 14% primary due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017 offset by the increases in revenues and increases in expenses discussed above.

Overall margin decreased from 20.4% in fiscal 2017 to 16.3% in fiscal 2018 primarily due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017, acquisitions completed and incremental pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues in fiscal 2018. These drivers were offset by operational and selling efficiencies in fiscal 2018.

Adjusted EBIT

In fiscal 2018, adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. Overall adjusted EBIT margin increased slightly due to operational and selling efficiencies offset by pressure from fiscal 2018 acquisitions and incremental pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 25.3% and 31.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the impacts of the Act and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions partially offset by the impact in the prior period of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impact of the benefit due to tax incentives associated with the

28

domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit in fiscal 2017. Refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes

The adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 26.1% and 30.9%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to the reduction in the blended federal corporate statutory tax rate to 28.1% from 35% as a result of the Act and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2018, partially offset by the impact of a benefit due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit in fiscal 2017.

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS

Net earnings, as reported, decreased 6% in fiscal 2018 due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017 offset by the reduction in our effective tax rate described above and an increase in our underlying earnings before income taxes, when compared to fiscal 2017.

Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $3.66 in fiscal 2018, as compared to $3.85 in fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share reflects the decrease in net earnings offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 8.5 million shares in fiscal 2018 and 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS

Adjusted net earnings increased 16% in fiscal 2018 due to the increase in adjusted EBIT combined with the reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2017.

For fiscal 2018, our adjusted diluted EPS reflects the changes described above in our net earnings and shares outstanding.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Total Revenues

Our revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and foreign currency translation. Revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.

Total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.

Total Expenses

Our total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue. These increases were partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017.

Operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our Service Alignment Initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses.

29

Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.

Other income, net, increased $183.9 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the gain on sale of the AdvancedMD ("AMD") business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million in fiscal 2016.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13% due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016. Overall margin increased from 19.2% in fiscal 2016 to 20.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, and operating efficiencies, partially offset by the net charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort in fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of AMD in fiscal 2016, and additional interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance in fiscal 2016.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT excludes certain interest amounts, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and the Workforce Optimization Effort, and the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of the AMD business in fiscal 2016.

Adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.

Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale

30

of the AMD business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. This decrease was offset by a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

Net earnings from continuing operations, as reported, increased 16% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the reduction in our effective tax rate described above, when compared to fiscal 2016.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in adjusted EBIT and reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2016.

For fiscal 2017, our Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 13.5 million shares during fiscal 2017 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by shares issued under our employee benefit plans.

Employer Services

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

Revenues

Employer Services' revenues, as reported, increased 5% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. Revenues increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. Our revenue growth includes two percentage points of combined benefit from foreign currency and acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses in fiscal 2017. Our revenues also benefited from the impact of an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls as our pays per control increased 2.7% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.  Employer Services client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2018 increased 50 basis points to 90.4% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2017. This improvement was driven by higher retention across our cloud-based solutions, our focus on improving the client experience, and the loss of a large client within our former CHSA business in fiscal 2017.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Employer Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  The increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $353.7 million, primarily due to investments in operational resources to support our revenue growth coupled with increased selling expenses in fiscal 2018.

Employer Services' overall margin increased from 30.6% to 30.7% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. This 10 basis point increase is primarily due to operational efficiencies in fiscal 2018, offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Revenues

Employer Services' revenues, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, and foreign currency translation. Revenues increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. Our revenues also benefited from the impact of an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls as our pays per control increased 2.4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017. Employer Services revenue retention rate for fiscal 2017 decreased 50 basis points to 90.0% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the lower retention on our legacy client platforms and the loss of a large client within our former CHSA business.

32

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Employer Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $202.4 million.  The increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients on growing revenues as well as investments in our sales organization, partially offset by the disposition of the CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017.

Employer Services' overall margin increased from 30.4% to 30.6% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. This 20 basis point increase was driven by operational efficiencies partially offset by 30 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative.

PEO Services

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

Revenues

PEO Services' revenues as reported increased 12% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. Such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,945.5 million for fiscal year 2018 and $2,628.4 million for fiscal year 2017 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. The increase in revenues was due to a 9% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new PEO Services clients as well as higher benefit pass-through revenues in our PEO benefit offerings.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

PEO Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 12% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $357.4 million. This increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $317.1 million described above. Overall margin remained flat for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, due to pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues partially offset by reductions in selling expense.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Revenues

PEO Services' revenues as reported increased 13% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. Such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,628.4 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2,336.3 million for fiscal year 2016 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. The increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new PEO Services clients and growth in our existing clients.

Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

PEO Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 21% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $333.1 million. This increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $292.1 million. Overall margin increased from 12.1% to 12.9% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues.

33

Other

The primary components of “Other” are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments. Changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations, has been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period in the table above, and did not materially affect reportable segment results. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") will begin reviewing segment results reported at actual interest rates and the results of the PEO segment inclusive of the results of ADP Indemnity. Additionally, the CODM will begin reviewing results with changes to certain corporate allocations. These changes represent a change in the measure of segment performance. The Company will reflect these new segment measures beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and prior period segment results will be restated for comparability.

ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG.  We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business.  Premiums are charged by ADP Indemnity to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services' worksite employees. The premiums charged from ADP Indemnity to PEO Services are eliminated in Other segment. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity and included in Other segment.  ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $40 million in fiscal 2018 and $20 million in fiscal 2017, which was primarily the result of favorable changes in estimated incurred losses. For the fiscal years 2013 to 2018, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. We believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. During fiscal 2018, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $235.0 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2018 policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $218.0 million in July 2018 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2019 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2018 reinsurance policy.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our $9.8 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we will benefit from the Act. We anticipate a future adjusted effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, of 25% to 26% beyond fiscal 2018. With this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions, including assessing reinvestments into the business, potential acquisitions, and/or returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, among other potential uses.

For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our $9.8 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.

As of June 30, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016, are summarized as follows:

*See Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of adjustments.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

Net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments such as the VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of COBRA and CHSA in fiscal 2017).

Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $632.6 million, payments made related to acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and proceeds from the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $234.0 million in fiscal 2017.

Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $6,461.0 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees and less cash paid for share repurchases. We purchased approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $116.07 during fiscal 2018 as compared to purchases of 13.5 million shares at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.  The increased cash flow from client fund obligations and reduced share repurchases were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders via dividends, which increased by $68.5 million from fiscal 2017.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016

Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital, which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business.

Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,493.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of $1,621.8 million.

Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $14,923.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, and proceeds from our $2.0 billion September 2015 debt issuance.

We purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

Capital Resources and Client Fund Obligations

In fiscal 2016, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing, including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance.

Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.8 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and Prime-1 by Moody’s. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  In fiscal 2018 and 2017, our average daily borrowings were $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper during fiscal 2018 and 2017 was approximately two days.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.

Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. For fiscal 2018 and 2017, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $374.4 million and $274.8 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.3% and 0.6%, respectively. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.

We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $3.8 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2019 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2023 and June 2022, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  We had no borrowings through June 30, 2018 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.8 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.

Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral.  All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 were $192.0 million, as compared to $249.1 million for fiscal 2017. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 to be about $250 million.

Contractual Obligations

 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at June 30, 2018:

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----- -------- --------- ------- ----------------- ------- ----- ----- - ------- - ----- - -------

Total $ 573.1 $ 1,732.4 $ 307.0 $ 1,460.0 $ 116.8 $ 4,189.3

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) These amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Purchase obligations are comprised of a $218.0 million reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal 2019 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to $23.4 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. For $21.8 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. These amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $8.3 million in fiscal 2019.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Acquisition-related obligations relate to contingent consideration for a business acquisition for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability.

In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2018, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2019, total $27,493.5 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $27,137.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018.

Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $218.0 million in July 2018 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2019 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2018 reinsurance policy. At June 30, 2018, ADP Indemnity had total assets of $523.7 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $433.8 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. ADP Indemnity paid claims of $4.6 million and $10.7 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Refer to the "Analysis of Reportable Segments - Other" above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity.

In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

37

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).

Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.

We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client’s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client’s obligation.  As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.8 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody’s, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $9.8 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.

We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A.  The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.

Total available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 22,776.2 $ 21,901.1 $ 21,605.0

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 1.9% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2019.  A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2019.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial mortgage backed securities. Approximately 80% of our available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at June 30, 2018.  In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government and United Kingdom government securities.

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. We had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2018 or 2017.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 1, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

PEO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes.

The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the Company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement. With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.

The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. With respect to the fees for benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes, the Company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.

We recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.

Client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun. These fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.

We assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.

Goodwill. We account for goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2018 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.  Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade,

40

enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.  As such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins.  Based upon the quantitative assessment, the Company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not” assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $45.2 million and $74.6 million, respectively.

If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings by up to $2 million and expected cash payments could be up to $25 million in the next twelve months. The liability related to cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months has been reclassified from other liabilities to current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

Note 1. Non-GAAP measures

In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:

We believe periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

["), severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of $20.5 million, and other transformation initiatives of $47.2 million which primarily consist of severance charges totaling $41.9 million for fiscal 2018. Charges for transformation initiatives for periods prior to fiscal 2018 primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. Refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of charges associated with the VERP.

(c) Represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters.

(d) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.

(e) The tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, the gain on the sale of the assets, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.

(f) The one-time net provision from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is comprised of a one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, accrued foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earning and profit that may no longer be utilizable as foreign tax credits, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized offset by the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments.

(g) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

[") by Moody’s, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $9.8 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.

We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A.  The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.

Total available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 22,776.2 $ 21,901.1 $ 21,605.0

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 1.9% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2019.  A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2019.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial mortgage backed securities. Approximately 80% of our available-for-sale securities held a AAA or AA rating at June 30, 2018.  In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government and United Kingdom government securities.

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. We had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2018 or 2017.

See Note 1, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
