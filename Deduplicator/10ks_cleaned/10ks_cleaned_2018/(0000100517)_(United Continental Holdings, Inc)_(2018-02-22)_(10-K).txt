ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Overview

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “UAL” or the “Company”) is a holding company and
its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “United”). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also
apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL’s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL’s assets,
liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United
are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.

2017 Financial Highlights

 • 2017 net income was $2.1 billion, or $7.02 diluted earnings per share.

 • United’s consolidated PRASM decreased 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016.

 • Aircraft fuel cost increased 18.9% year-over-year due mainly to higher fuel prices.

 • In 2017, UAL repurchased approximately 28 million shares of UAL common stock for $1.8 billion, completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by UAL’s Board of Directors in July 2016. In December 2017, UAL’s Board of Directors authorized a new $3.0 billion share repurchase program to acquire UAL’s common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $3.0 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.

 • UAL ended the year with $5.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available capacity under the revolving credit facility.

2017 Operational Highlights

 • Consolidated RPMs for 2017 increased 2.8% as compared to 2016, and consolidated ASMs increased 3.5% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 82.4% in 2017 versus 82.9% in 2016.

 • For 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded a DOT on-time arrival rate of 81.9% and 81.3%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 99.0% for each year.

 • During 2017, the Company took delivery of three new Boeing 787-9s, four new Boeing 737-800s, 12 new Boeing 777-300ERs, 24 new Embraer E175s, two used Airbus A320s and six used Airbus A319s and retired 20 Boeing 747-400s.

Outlook
Set forth below is a discussion
of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of
operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report and the factors described under “Forward-Looking Information” below for additional discussion of these and other
factors that could affect us.
In 2017, the Company had its best operational performance in its post-merger history. Operational reliability, service and
experience underpin the Company’s long-term strategy. Our priorities for 2018 are continued top-tier operational reliability while strengthening our domestic network through growth, driving efficiency and
productivity and continued investment in our employees, product and technology.

Economic Conditions. The aviation industry in 2018 is expected to show continued growth in the
demand for air travel. Passenger numbers are expected to increase. Cargo volumes are also expected to grow, with some recovery in yields. Passenger revenue in all regions are expected to demonstrate improved performance in 2018.

Capacity. In 2018, the Company expects its consolidated ASMs to grow between 4% and 6% year-over-year. Most of this growth will be
concentrated in our domestic network, especially in our mid-continent hubs. We believe greater scale and connectivity at our hubs reinforces our relevance and value proposition to our customers. Rebanking at
our hubs is expected to drive significant additional connection opportunities. We will also expand flights in non-peak times of the year to more efficiently use our aircraft and facilities with the objective
of driving an increase in profitability.
Fuel. The Company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.74
in 2017 as compared to $1.49 in 2016. The price of jet fuel has increased since January 2016 and remains volatile. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2018, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the
Company’s annual fuel expense by approximately $96 million.
Results of Operations

In this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 with results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2016, and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 with results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.

(a) See Part II,
Item 6, Selected Financial Data, of this report for the definition of these statistics.
Consolidated passenger revenue increased $0.9 billion, or
3.0%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to a 2.8% increase in traffic. Consolidated PRASM decreased 0.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including more aggressive
low-cost carrier pricing in our hub markets, temporary share loss during roll-out of our Basic Economy pricing, and softer demand in China and Guam. Our revenue in 2017
was negatively impacted by severe storms during the third quarter.
Cargo revenue increased $159 million, or 18.2%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to
higher year-over-year international freight volume and yield.

Landing fees and other rent increased $75 million, or 3.5%, in 2017 as compared to the
year-ago period due to higher rental and landing fee rates.
Regional capacity purchase costs increased
$35 million, or 1.6%, in 2017 as compared to the year-ago period despite regional capacity being down 3.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increases in annual rates, maintenance cycle-related costs and
lease return costs.
Depreciation and amortization increased $172 million, or 8.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to additions of new and
used aircraft, aircraft improvements and increases in information technology infrastructure and application development projects.
Aircraft maintenance
materials and outside repairs increased $107 million, or 6.1%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance visits and additional repairs to wireless and inflight entertainment equipment.

Aircraft rent decreased $59 million, or 8.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the purchase of leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates.

Consolidated passenger revenue decreased
$1.3 billion, or 4.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Consolidated PRASM decreased 5.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including a competitive domestic fare environment, lower surcharges, a strong U.S.
dollar and reductions from energy-related corporate travel.

Table of Contents

Cargo revenue decreased $61 million, or 6.5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to lower freight yields
and lower mail volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. Freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel prices. Another contributing factor to the
year-over-year decrease was a U.S. West Coast port labor dispute that resulted in an increase in air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. The labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.

Other operating expenses 5,421 5,078 343 6.8

Total operating expenses $ 32,218 $ 32,698 $ (480) (1.5)

Salaries and related costs increased $562 million, or 5.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pay rates
and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 2.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees, partially
offset by a reduction in profit sharing expense in 2016 as compared to 2015, a reduction in medical and dental costs and the results of certain costs savings initiatives in 2016.

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices and a reduction in fuel hedge losses, partially offset by the impact
of a 1.4% increase in capacity. 2016 fuel expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except
percentage changes):

-------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ----- ------- - ----- ------------------------ ---- ------ ---- - ------- - ---- ------

Fuel expense 5,813 7,522 (22.7) 1.49 1.94 (23.2)
Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,904 3,886 0.5

Depreciation and amortization increased $158 million, or 8.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to additions of
new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements, accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types and increases in information technology assets.

33

Table of Contents

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $98 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 as compared
to 2015 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits and volume-driven increases in component costs, partially offset by a reduction in costs due to the timing of
maintenance on certain engines.
Aircraft rent decreased $74 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lease expirations, the
purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.
The table below presents
special charges incurred by the Company during the years ended December 31 (in millions):

See Note 14 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Other operating expenses increased $343 million, or 6.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in ground handling costs, food and
technology costs associated with the Company’s enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in hotel expenses for crews, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 Summer Olympics and volume-driven increases in cargo
costs.
Nonoperating Income (Expense)
The
following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Company’s nonoperating income (expense) for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

Miscellaneous, net (19) (352) (333) (94.6)

Total nonoperating expense, net $ (519) $ (947) $ (428) (45.2)

The decrease in interest expense of $55 million, or 8.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment
of certain debt issuances in 2015 and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, the conversion of certain operating leases to capital leases and certain constructed
airport assets accounted for as capital leases.
In 2015, Miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for
hedge accounting. Foreign currency losses were approximately $43 million and $129 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency results included $8 million and $61 million of foreign exchange losses for 2016 and 2015,
respectively, related to the Company’s cash holdings in Venezuela. Miscellaneous, net for 2015 also includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the 6% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of
$0.6 billion from December 31, 2016. The Company had its entire commitment capacity of $2.0 billion under the revolving credit facility of the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of
March 29, 2017 (as amended by the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of November 15, 2017, the “2017 Credit Agreement”) available for borrowings as of December 31, 2017. As of
December 31, 2017, the Company had $109 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and collateral associated with obligations for facility leases and workers’ compensation. We
may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 totaled $124 million.

We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension
funding obligations. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $14.4 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.7 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial
noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. As of December 31, 2017, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.6 billion. However,
approximately $6.1 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not cash outlays. The
deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations.
The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities
to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related interest.
For 2018, the Company expects between
$3.6 billion and $3.8 billion of gross capital expenditures. See Note 13 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.

As of December 31, 2017, a substantial portion of the Company’s assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program
intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital
expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. See Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.

The following is a discussion of the Company’s sources and uses of cash from 2015 through 2017.

Operating Activities
2017 compared to 2016

Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.4 billion compared to $5.5 billion in the same period in
2016, the decrease resulting from lower operating income and reduced cash flows from certain changes in working capital items. Excluding the non-cash impairment of the Newark slots, operating income
for 2017 was approximately $1.2 billion lower than 2016. Working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by an additional $1.2 billion year-over-year in 2017 as compared to 2016. The following were significant working capital
items in 2017:

 • $0.9 billion decrease in advanced purchase of miles due to increased utilization of pre-purchased miles.

 • $0.4 billion increase in prepayments for maintenance contracts.

2016 compared to 2015

Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.5 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the same period in 2015.
Working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by

$0.5 billion year-over-year in 2016 as compared to 2015. The following were significant working capital items in 2016:

 • Frequent flyer and advance purchase of miles decreased $0.6 billion due to increased utilization of pre-purchased miles.

 • Other assets, including spare parts, increased by $0.3 billion as part of the Company’s efforts to improve fleet reliability.

 • Accounts payable increased $0.2 billion, driven by the timing of payments.

Investing Activities

2017 compared to 2016
The Company’s
capital expenditures were $4.0 billion and $3.2 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of new aircraft, aircraft improvements,
facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology assets.
2016 compared to 2015

The Company’s capital expenditures were $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s capital
expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology assets.

Financing Activities
Significant financing events
in 2017 were as follows:
Share Repurchases

The Company used $1.8 billion of cash to purchase approximately 28 million shares of its common stock during 2017, completing its
July 2016 repurchase authorization. In December 2017, UAL’s Board of Directors authorized a new $3.0 billion share repurchase program to acquire UAL’s common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately
$3.0 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.
Debt Issuances

During 2017, United received and recorded $1.8 billion of proceeds as debt related to enhanced equipment trust certificate
(“EETC”) offerings created in 2016 and 2017 to finance the purchase of aircraft.

We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase.
