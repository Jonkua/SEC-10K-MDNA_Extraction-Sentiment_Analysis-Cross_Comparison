Executive Summary

Company Overview

 Welltower
Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is
driving the transformation of health care infrastructure.  The Company invests
with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems
to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care
delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care
experience.  WelltowerTM, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”),
owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the
United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of
seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties.
Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development
and property management services, make us a single-source solution for
acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real
estate assets.

 The following table
summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2017

Business Strategy

 Our
primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder
value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create
opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of
annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these
objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health
care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type,
relationship and geographic location.

 Substantially
all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services,
and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our
primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the
continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest
payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent
that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable
to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us,
there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of
operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we
monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of
property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally
includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for
each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property
inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real
estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property
management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with
a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease
expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system
relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market
conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each
property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the
facility.  When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate
or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene
at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both
the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

 In
addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our relevant
investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are
normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition,
operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are
generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate
loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its
affiliates.

 For
the year ended December 31, 2017, rental income and resident fees/services represented
33% and 64%, respectively, of total revenues.  Substantially all of our
operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with
fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line
basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment.
Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally
recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our
yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the
stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term
of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments.

 Our
primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees/services,
borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of
debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions, and
principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include
dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and
interest), real

29

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

property investments (including
acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances, and transaction
costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, and general and
administrative expenses.  Depending upon the availability and cost of external
capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

 We
also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  New
investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary
unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from
investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating
income and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for
future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured
credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the
issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption
of secured debt.

 Depending
upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate
returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may
occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new
investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely
affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions
in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our
available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit
facility. At December 31, 2017, we had $243,777,000 of cash and cash
equivalents, $65,526,000 of restricted cash and $2,258,635,000 of available
borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.

Key Transactions

          Capital.   During the year ended December 31, 2017, we extinguished
$1,080,268,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.2%.  In
addition, we redeemed all 11,500,000 shares of our 6.5% Series J Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock.  Also, for the year ended
December 31, 2017, we raised $611,443,000 through our dividend
reinvestment program and our Equity Shelf Program (as defined below).  The
capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under
our primary unsecured credit facility and proceeds from dispositions, supported
new investment activity for the year.

 Investments. The following summarizes our property acquisitions
and joint venture investments made during the year ended December 31, 2017
(dollars in thousands):

 Dividends.
Our Board of Directors announced the 2018 annual cash dividend of $3.48 per common
share ($0.87 per share quarterly), consistent with 2017, beginning in February
2018.  The dividend declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 represents
the 187th consecutive quarterly dividend payment.

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

 We
utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of
our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating
performance, credit strength and concentration risk.  Management uses these key
performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our
historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget
planning

30

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

purposes.

 Operating
Performance. We believe that net income and net income attributable to
common stockholders (“NICS”) per the Statement of Comprehensive Income are the
most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our
operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common
stockholders (“FFO”), consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) and same store
NOI (“SSNOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S.
GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for
further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used
by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment
recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent
historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods
presented (in thousands):

 Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------------------------- - --------- ----------------------- - --------- ---- ---------
 2015 2016 2017

Net income $ 888,549 $ 1,082,070 $ 540,613
Net income attributable to common stockholders 818,344 1,012,397 463,595
Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders 1,409,640 1,582,940 1,165,576
Consolidated net operating income 2,237,569 2,404,177 2,232,716
Same store net operating income 1,523,666 1,499,511 1,519,193

 Credit Strength. We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios
and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet
capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and Internal Revenue
Code (“IRC”) section 1031 deposits. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to
service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal
amortization and preferred dividends). We expect to maintain capitalization
ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent
with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“AEBITDA”). Please refer
to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion
and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are
widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation,
comparison, investment recommendations, and rating of companies. The following
table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures
for the periods presented:

 Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------------------- ----- ----------------------- ----- ----
 2015 2016 2017

Net debt to book capitalization ratio 44.8% 42.9% 42.9%
Net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio 39.5% 37.4% 36.3%
Net debt to market capitalization ratio 32.5% 31.1% 31.2%

Adjusted interest coverage ratio 4.24x 4.21x 4.36x
Adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio 3.35x 3.34x 3.54x

 Concentration Risk. We
evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship
mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in
understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were
to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that
relates to our various property types. Relationship mix measures the portion of
our NOI that relates to our top five relationships.  Geographic mix measures
the portion of our NOI that relates to our top five states (or international
equivalents). The following table reflects our recent historical trends of
concentration risk by NOI for the periods indicated below:

 We evaluate our key performance
indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical
trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be
achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are
described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and
other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve
performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our
financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these
plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and Company-specific
trends. Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.

Governance

 Maintaining
investor confidence and trust is important in today’s business environment. Our
Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and
procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our
corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business
operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while
meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing
standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the
Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance.  The information on our

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Sources and Uses
of Cash

 During
the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-18, “Restricted Cash,” and ASU No. 2016-15, “Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.”  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information.

 Our primary sources of
cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees/services, borrowings
under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and
equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions, and principal
payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend
distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real
property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures,
construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating
expenses, and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of
cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are
discussed in further detail below.  The following is a summary of our sources
and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 Operating
Activities. The change in net cash provided from operating
activities is attributable to changes in NOI, which is primarily due to
dispositions in 2016 and 2017, partially offset by acquisitions and annual rent
increasers.  Please see “Results of Operations” below for further discussion.
For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, cash flows from
operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.

Investing Activities.  The changes in net cash used in investing activities are
primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments, real estate
loans receivable, and investments in unconsolidated entities which are
summarized above in “Key Transactions in 2017.”  Please refer to Notes 3, 6,
and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  The
following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement
activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 The change in new development is primarily due to the number
and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods.
Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures
to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a
market-competitive position, and/or achieve property stabilization.  Generally,
these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions, primarily in our
seniors housing operating segment.

 Financing Activities. The changes in net cash provided from financing activities are
primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements,
the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock, and dividend payments
which are summarized above in “Key Transactions in 2017.”  Please refer to
Notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 At December 31, 2017, we
had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging
from 10% to 50%. Please see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for
additional information.  We use financial derivative instruments to hedge
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Please see Note 11
to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  At
December 31, 2017, we had fourteen outstanding letter of credit obligations.
Please see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional

Capital Structure

 Please
refer to “Credit Strength” above for our leverage and coverage ratio trends.
Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of
default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum
net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,
create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, we believe
we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. None
of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be
triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit
facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the
fees and interest charged.  We plan to manage the Company to maintain
compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with
our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or
all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and
availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

 On May 1, 2015, we
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (1) an open-ended
automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate
amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock,
depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in
connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) under which we
may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. As of January 31, 2018, 2,108,286
shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration
statement. We have entered into separate Equity Distribution Agreements with
each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to
$1,000,000,000 aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf Program”).  The
Equity Shelf Program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements.  We
expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale
agreement on one or more dates on or prior to the maturity date of that
particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive per
share cash proceeds at settlement equal to the forward sale price under the
relevant forward sale agreement.  However, we may elect to cash settle or net
share settle a forward share agreement.  As of January 31, 2018, we had $784,083,000
of remaining capacity under the Equity Shelf Program and there were no
outstanding forward sales agreements. Depending upon market conditions, we
anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in
additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured
credit facility.

 During the past three years,
inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate
inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily
from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments
are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes,
secured debt, and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.
During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest
rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new
investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming
the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not
increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability
of equity and debt financing for us.

The 2017 decrease
in rental income is primarily attributable to the disposition of properties
exceeding new acquisitions and conversions of newly constructed triple-net
properties. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are
contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and/or changes in
the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties.  These escalators are
not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is
recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  If
gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the CPI do not increase, a
portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  Our leases could renew
above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in
rental income.  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had no triple-net
lease renewals but we had 25 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from
0.15% to 0.36% in our triple-net portfolio. The 2017 decrease in interest
income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during 2016 and
2017 and the 2016 increase is attributable to higher loan volumes during the
majority of 2016.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed seven
triple-net construction projects totaling $283,472,000 or $347,818 per bed/unit
and two expansion projects totaling $10,336,000. The following is a summary of
triple-net construction projects pending as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in

interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees.
The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing
of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates,
extinguishments and principal amortizations. The
fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable
to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The
following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for
the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2017 primarily
as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties. To the extent that we
acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for
depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.  Changes in gains on
sales of properties are related to the volume of property sales and the sales
prices.  During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded impairment charges totaling $96,909,000 related to 21 properties,
$20,169,000 related to 22 properties, and $2,220,000 related to two properties,
respectively.

The provision for loan losses is related to our
critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed
in “Critical Accounting Policies” below and Note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we
recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to
Genesis HealthCare (“Genesis”) of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, other
expenses primarily represents non-capitalizable transaction costs, including
$88,316,000 related to a joint venture transaction with an existing seniors
housing operator, including the conversion of properties from triple-net to
seniors housing operating, an exchange of PropCo/OpCo interests and
termination/restructuring of pre-existing relationships.

In April 2011, we completed the acquisition of
substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned Genesis.  In
conjunction with this transaction, we received the option to acquire an
ownership interest in Genesis.  In February 2015, Genesis closed on a
transaction to merge with Skilled Healthcare Group to become a publicly traded
company which required us to record the value of the derivative asset due to
the net settlement feature.  This event resulted in $58,427,000 gain. During
the fourth quarter of 2015, the cost basis of this investment exceeded the fair
value.  Management performed an assessment to determine whether the decline in
fair value was other than temporary and concluded that it was.  As a result, we
recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of $35,648,000 which was
recorded in other expense.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, management
recorded an additional other than temporary charge of $18,294,000 in other
expenses on the Genesis equity investment.

A portion of our triple-net properties were formed
through partnerships.  Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents
our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the
noncontrolling partner.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
represents our partners’ share of net income relating to those partnerships
where we are the controlling partner.

 Fluctuations in resident fees/services and property operating
expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions and the movement of U.S. and
foreign currency exchange rates. The fluctuations in depreciation and
amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of
short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of
additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. The
increase in other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily a
result of insurance proceeds received relating to a property as well as a
bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property
acquisition.

 The majority of our
seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests.
The fluctuations in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities are largely due
to the recognition of impairments related to one of our investments in
unconsolidated

entities during the year ended December
31, 2017. In addition, losses are also attributable to depreciation and amortization
of short-lived intangible assets related to certain investments in
unconsolidated joint ventures in 2013 and 2014.   Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income (loss)
related to joint ventures.

 During the year ended
December 31, 2017, we completed one seniors housing operating construction
project representing $3,634,000 or $302,820 per unit.  The following is a

 The increases in gains on real estate
dispositions is due to higher volumes of property sales. During the years ended
December 31, 2017, and 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $21,949,000
and $12,403,000, relating to three and two properties, respectively.

The increases
in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new
properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical
properties from which we receive rent. Certain of our leases contain annual
rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the CPI.  These
escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental
income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the
period.  If the CPI does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not
continue to increase.  Revenue from real property that is sold would offset
revenue increases and, to the extent that revenues from sold properties exceed
those from new acquisitions, we would experience decreased revenues.  Our
leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase
or decrease in rental income.  For the three months ended December 31,
2017, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 79,129 square feet
of new leases and 270,505 square feet of renewals.  The weighted-average
term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $32.92 per square foot and
tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $11.43 per square foot.
Substantially all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an
annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in
CPI to 3.5%.

The
fluctuation in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to
acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities
for which we incur certain property operating expenses.  The fluctuations in
depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in
amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or
dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change
accordingly.

During the
year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan loss related to
our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses discussed in
“Critical Accounting Policies” below and Note 6 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Changes
in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.  During 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges
related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the
estimated fair values less costs to sell.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed four
outpatient medical construction projects representing $63,036,000 or $311 per
square foot. The following is a summary of outpatient medical construction
projects pending as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):

Total 179,331 $ 117,522 $ 52,230

 Total interest expense
represents secured debt interest expense. The change in secured debt interest
expense is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions,
extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on
extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments
and terms of the related secured debt.  The following is a summary of our
outpatient medical secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars

The change
in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances
and extinguishments, primarily the $450,000,000 of 4.70% senior unsecured notes
extinguished in December 2016.  Please refer to Note 10 to consolidated
financial statements for additional information.  The loss on extinguishment of
debt in 2015 is primarily due to the early extinguishment of the 2016 senior
unsecured notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early
extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes. The change in interest
expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net
effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes.
Please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility.

 General
and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 2.83%, 3.63% and 3.82%,
respectively.  The 2017 decrease in general and administrative expenses is
primarily related to a reduction in professional service fees for tax and legal
consulting and compensation costs as a result of execution of our strategic
initiatives.

 Other
expenses for 2017 primarily represents $40,730,000 of costs related to
finalization of an agreement with the University of Toledo Foundation to
transfer our corporate headquarters as a donation. Other expenses for all years
also includes severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain
executive officers and key employees.  During 2017, we incurred expenses
totaling approximately $3,811,000 in connection with the litigation captioned
Welltower v. Brinker, Case No. G-4801-CI-0201702692-000 (Ct. Common Pleas,
Toledo, Ohio).  These expenses were offset by:  1) $4,000,000 we received
pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the litigation; and 2) approximately
$2,848,000 that Mr. Brinker was owed under his Separation Agreement with us,
which was forgiven pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the litigation. Other
expenses in 2015 also included costs associated with the termination of our
investment in a strategic outpatient medical partnership.

 The
fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to benefits recognized in the
year ended December 31, 2016 related to the release of a valuation allowance
reserve on a taxable subsidiary and the restructuring of an unconsolidated
investment. The decrease in preferred dividends and the preferred stock redemption
charge are due to the redemption of our 6.5% Series J preferred stock during
the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Other

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders
(“NICS”), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings
measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
(“AEBITDA”) to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance.
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP
implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real
estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many
industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating
results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be
insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”) created funds from operations attributable to common
stockholders (“FFO”) as a supplemental measure of operating performance for
REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as
defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding
gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable
assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.

Consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating
performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including
tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating
expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing
tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical facility
properties.  These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related
payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing,
housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and
insurance.  General and administrative expenses (excluded from NOI) represent
costs unrelated to property operations.  These expenses include, but are not
limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses, and
depreciation of corporate fixed assets.  Same store NOI (“SSNOI”) is used to
evaluate the operating performance of our properties under a consistent
population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  As
used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating
properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to January 1,
2015.  Land parcels, loans, sub-leases and major capital restructurings as well
as any properties acquired, developed/redeveloped, transitioned, sold or
classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store
amounts.  We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful
information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at
the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make
decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level
performance of our properties.

EBITDA stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow
provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure
because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the
performance of our operations. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our
interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and
our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed
charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal
amortization, and preferred dividends. Covenants in our senior unsecured notes
contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to
those agreements. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event
of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and
availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
Due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we
have disclosed AEBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above excluding
unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. We use AEBITDA
to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents AEBITDA
divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges
include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest
expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our
covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50
times.

Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures
are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in
the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.
Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external
comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating
decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors
to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or
cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability
or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be
comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs or other
companies.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make
estimates and assumptions.  Management considers accounting estimates or
assumptions critical if:

·
the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the
levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain
matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

·
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition
or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the
development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
disclosure presented below relating to them.  Management believes the current
assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our
consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely
to change in the future.  However, since these estimates require assumptions to
be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the
risk of change.  If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other
considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated
financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial
condition.  Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information on significant accounting policies that
impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting
pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

The following table presents
information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material
assumptions used to develop each estimate:

Nature of Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

Real Estate Acquisitions On January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”) which narrows the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) definition of a business and provides a framework that gives entities a basis for making reasonable judgments about whether a transaction involves an asset or a business. ASU 2017-01 states that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the acquired asset is not a business. If this initial test is not met, an acquired asset cannot be considered a business unless it includes an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. The primary differences between business combinations and asset acquisitions include recording the asset acquisition at relative fair value, capitalizing transaction costs, and the elimination of the measurement period in which to record adjustments to the transaction. We believe that substantially all our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions. We are applying ASU 2017-01 prospectively for acquisitions after January 1, 2017. Regardless of whether an acquisition is considered an asset acquisition or a business combination, the cost of real property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings, and improvements. The remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period interest. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land, and in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases. We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. Amortization periods for intangibles are based on the remaining life of the lease or lease-up period.
Allowance for Loan Losses We maintain an allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans. If this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement or if it has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to income accrual status. The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and value of the underlying collateral. Any loans with collectability concerns are subjected to a projected payoff valuation. The valuation is based on the expected future cash flows and/or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The valuation is compared to the outstanding balance to determine the reserve needed for each loan. We may base our valuation on a loan’s observable market price, if any, or the fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the collateral.

Revenue Recognition Revenue is recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met. These four criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable income and reasonably assured collectability. If the collectability of revenue is determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could be significantly affected. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. Substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days’ notice. We evaluate the collectability of our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis. We evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the financial strength of the investment’s underlying operations as measured by cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and guaranties, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets for potential impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP. An impairment charge must be recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant’s inability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life, and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely uses of the property are compared to the current net book value. This analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during the period the property is expected to be held. Properties that meet the held-for-sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of fair value less costs to sell or carrying value.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.
