Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Recent Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This new standard eliminates certain exceptions in current guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Investments - equity securities; Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures; Derivatives and Hedging. In January 2020, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies the interaction between the accounting for investments in equity securities, equity method investments and certain derivative instruments. The new standard is expected to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability of the accounting for these interactions. The standards update is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. In August 2020, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. Specifically, the standard simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP, removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it, and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The standards update is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2020 but the guidance must be adopted as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We plan to early adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2021 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements

Marketable equity securities 129 129 —
Total assets $ 1,566 $ 175 $ 1,391

We classify our cash equivalents and investments within Level 1 and Level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, a Level 2 input.
We hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. Term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents and those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of U.S. treasury securities and term deposits with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.

Our marketable equity securities consist of our investment in Despegar, a publicly traded company, which is included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recognized a loss of approximately $6 million, a gain of $10 million, and a loss of approximately $145 million, respectively, within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net forward liabilities of $14 million ($23 million gross forward liability) and $8 million ($30 million gross forward liability) recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We recorded $74 million, $(8) million and $47 million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill. Due to the severe and persistent negative effect COVID-19 has had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment on October 1, 2020, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill. As a result of these assessments during 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million, of which $559 million related to our Retail segment, primarily our Vrbo reporting unit, and $240 million related to our trivago segment.
Our assessments compared the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. The fair value estimates for all reporting units, except trivago, were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account operating result trends, the anticipated duration of COVID-19 impacts and rates of recovery, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago’s stock price, a Level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium. The excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in each of the periods. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable reporting units within our Retail segment had $2.3 billion of goodwill remaining after these impairments and our trivago segment had $337 million of goodwill remaining.
During 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $86 million related to a reporting unit in our Retail segment. The charges resulted from sustained under-performance and a less optimistic outlook of the reporting unit, beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and deteriorating further into the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, we performed an interim and annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for that reporting unit. The fair value estimates for both the interim and annual impairment tests were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs as described above. The excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in the respective periods. As of December 31, 2018, the applicable reporting unit had no remaining goodwill.
Intangible Assets. During 2020, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $175 million within our Retail segment, of which $119 million related to indefinite-lived trade names as a result of changes in the estimated future revenues of the related brands as well as $35 million related to definite-lived intangible assets and $21 million related to other long-lived assets.
The indefinite-lived intangible assets, classified as Level 3 measurements, were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including projected revenues and royalty rates, which ranged from 2% to 8% with a weighted average royalty rate of 7%. For definite-lived intangible assets, classified as Level 3 measurements, we compared the estimated future, net undiscounted cash flows, which included key inputs such as rates of growth and profitability of our business as well as incremental net working capital, to the long-lived asset’s carrying amount. As discussed further in NOTE 16 – Acquisitions, Other Investments and Divestitures, during the third quarter of 2020, we met the criteria to recognize certain smaller businesses within our Retail segment as held-for-sale. As such, we remeasured the disposal groups at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 measurement and was based on each transaction’s estimated consideration as of the date of close.
During 2018, we recognized an intangible impairment charge of $42 million in conjunction with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets on October 1, 2018. The impairment charge was related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our Retail segment and resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brand. The asset, classified as Level 3 measurement, was written down to $27 million based on valuation using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including royalty rates and projected revenues. In conjunction with the impairment, we reclassified the remainder to a definite-lived asset to be amortized over eight years.
The full duration and total impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold (in general and versus our expectations) for global economies, the travel industry or our business. Additionally, as the stock of our trivago segment is publicly traded, it is difficult to predict market dynamics and the extent or duration of any stock price declines. As a result, we may continue to record impairment charges in the future due to the potential long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minority Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $330 million and $467 million. During 2020, we recorded $134 million of losses related to a minority investment, which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments, using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. During 2019, we recorded $2 million of losses related to the minority investments. During 2018, we recorded $33 million of gains related to these minority investments, which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments. As of December 31, 2020, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $2 million in unrealized upward adjustments and $105 million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).

Impairment Assessments. We perform our annual assessment of possible impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
During 2020, due to the severe and persistent negative effect COVID-19 had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill and intangible assets. As a result of these assessments, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million, of which $559 million related to our Retail segment, primarily our Vrbo reporting unit, and $240 million related to our trivago segment. We also incurred impairment charges of $175 million related to intangible assets with both indefinite-lives and definite lives, primarily within our Retail segment.
During 2019, we had no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite-lives. During 2018, we incurred impairment charges related to intangible assets with indefinite-lives of $42 million and goodwill of $86 million both within our Retail segment.
Goodwill. The following table presents the changes in goodwill by reportable segment:

All of our outstanding senior notes (collectively the “Notes”) are senior unsecured obligations issued by Expedia Group and guaranteed by certain domestic Expedia Group subsidiaries. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Expedia Group and the guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Notes include covenants that limit our ability to (i) create certain liens, (ii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions and (iii) merge or consolidate with or into another entity or transfer substantially all of our assets. Accrued interest related to the Notes was $110 million and $76 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the holders thereof, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The total estimated fair value of our Notes was approximately $9.1 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Credit Facilities
Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, Expedia Group maintained a $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which was unconditionally guaranteed by certain domestic Expedia Group subsidiaries that were the same as under the Notes and expired in May 2023. The facility contained covenants including maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2019, we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding. On March 18, 2020, we borrowed $1.9 billion under the revolving credit facility.
Effective May 5, 2020, the revolving credit facility was amended and restated (the “Amended Credit Facility”) to, among other things:
•suspend the maximum leverage ratio covenant until December 31, 2021;
•increase the maximum permissible leverage ratio (once such covenant is reinstated) until March 31, 2023 (at which time the maximum permissible leverage ratio will return to the level in effect immediately prior to effectiveness of the Amended Credit Facility);
•eliminate the covenant imposing a minimum interest coverage ratio and add a covenant regarding minimum liquidity; as well as
•to make certain other amendments to the affirmative and negative covenants therein.
Obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Credit Facility (subject to certain exceptions, including for our new headquarters located in Seattle, WA) up to the maximum amount permitted under the indentures governing the Notes without securing such Notes. Aggregate commitments under the Amended Credit Facility initially totaled $2 billion, and mature on May 31, 2023.
Loans under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest (A) in the case of eurocurrency loans, at rates ranging from (i) prior to December 31, 2021, 2.25% per annum and (ii) on and after December 31, 2021, or prior to such date for each quarter that the leverage ratio, as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered, calculated on an annualized basis using consolidated EBITDA for the two most recently ended fiscal quarters included in such financial statements multiplied by two, is not greater than 5.00:1.00, from 1.00% to 1.75% depending on the Company’s credit ratings, and (B) in the case of base rate loans, at rates (i) prior to December 31, 2021, 1.25% per annum and (ii) on and after December 31, 2021, or prior to such date if the leverage ratio condition referred to above is satisfied, from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum depending on the Company’s credit ratings.
 The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”) issued under the prior credit facility as well as the Amended Credit Facility reduced the credit amount available. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was $13 million and $16 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facilities.
On August 5, 2020, the Amended Credit Facility was further amended in order to, among other things, make changes to certain provisions of the Amended Credit Facility to conform to the corresponding provisions in the Foreign Credit Facility described below.
Foreign Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Facility, on August 5, 2020, the Company and Expedia Group International Holdings III, LLC, as borrower (the “Borrower”), entered into that Credit Agreement (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Foreign Credit Facility”) with a group of lenders. Obligations under the Foreign Credit Facility are unsecured. Such obligations are guaranteed by the Company, its subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, as mentioned above, and the Second Amendment, dated as of August 5, 2020, as mentioned below, and certain of the Company’s additional subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”).
Aggregate commitments under the Foreign Credit Facility total $855 million, and mature on May 31, 2023. Substantially concurrently with the establishment of the Foreign Credit Facility, the Company reduced commitments under the Amended Credit Facility in an amount equal to $855 million and prepaid indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility in an amount equal to $772 million, which was then outstanding under the Foreign Credit Facility.
Loans under the Foreign Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an index rate plus a margin (A) in the case of eurocurrency loans, (i) prior to December 31, 2021, equal to 2.50% per annum and (ii) on and after December 31, 2021, or prior to such date for each quarter that the leverage ratio, as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered, calculated on an annualized basis using consolidated EBITDA for the two most recently ended fiscal quarters included in such financial statements multiplied by two, is not greater than 5.00:1.00, ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, and (B) in the case of base rate loans, (i) prior to December 31, 2021, equal to 1.50% per annum and (ii) on and after December 31, 2021, or prior to such date if the leverage ratio condition referred to above is satisfied, ranging from 0.25% to per 1.00% annum, depending on the Company’s credit ratings.
The covenants, events of default and other terms and conditions in the Foreign Credit Facility are substantially similar to those in the Amended Credit Facility, but include additional limitations on the Borrower and certain other entities that are not obligors under the Amended Credit Facility.
Subsidiary Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, one of our international subsidiaries maintained a Euro 50 million uncommitted credit facility, which was guaranteed by Expedia Group. The facility was terminated in January 2021.Outstanding Borrowings. In August 2020, the Company repaid the outstanding amount of $772 million on the Foreign Credit Facility as well as $478 million under the Amended Credit Facility. In December 2020, we repaid the remaining $650 million under the Amended Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the subsidiary credit facility.

 Employee Benefit PlansOur U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our contribution vests with the employee after the employee completes two years of service. Effective June 1, 2020, as part of cost-saving steps resulting from the business impact of COVID-19, the Expedia Retirement Savings Plan was amended to eliminate matching contributions. Matching contributions were subsequently reinstated effective December 1, 2020. Participating employees have the option to invest in our common stock, but there is no requirement for participating employees to invest their contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock. We also have various defined contribution plans for our international employees. Our contributions to these benefit plans were $63 million, $81 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Expedia Group, Inc. 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and other stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 14 million shares of common stock reserved for new stock-based awards under the 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan. We issue new shares to satisfy the exercise or release of stock-based awards. During 2019, we started issuing RSUs as our primary form of stock-based compensation, which vest 25% after one year and then vest quarterly over the following three years. During 2018, an equity choice program existed for annual awards that allowed for the choice of stock options or RSUs with certain limitations.

The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options shown in the stock option activity table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value at December 31, 2020, based on our closing stock price of $132.40 as of the last trading date in 2020. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $74 million, $145 million and $107 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
There were no options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 and options granted in 2019 were immaterial. The fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2018 were estimated at the date of grant using appropriate valuation techniques, including the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo option-pricing models, assuming the following weighted average assumptions:

 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----- -----
Risk-free interest rate 2.47 %
Expected volatility 32.81 %
Expected life (in years) 3.80
Dividend yield 1.11 %
Weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted during the year $ 24.97

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized total stock-based compensation expense of $205 million, $241 million and $203 million. The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $44 million, $55 million and $39 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018. We capitalized $36 million, $30 million and $24 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the cost of developing internal-use software in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $301 million and $284 million. Total current income tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 associated with the exercise of stock-based awards held by our employees were $1 million and $60 million.
As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $462 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of 2.47 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which allows shares of our common stock to be purchased by eligible employees at three-month intervals at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Eligible employees were allowed to contribute up to 10% of their base compensation. Effective August 1, 2020, eligible employees are allowed to contribute up to 15% of their base compensation. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 212,000, 171,000, and 170,000 shares were purchased under this plan for an average price of $84.89, $99.41 and $101.26 per share. As of December 31, 2020, we have reserved approximately 0.4 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP.

Provision for Income Taxes
The following table summarizes our provision for income taxes:

 Year Ended December 31,
-------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------- ----- --- - ---
 2020 2019 2018
 (In millions)
Current income tax (benefit) expense:
U.S. federal $ (31) $ 76 $ 186
State — 20 42
Foreign 96 198 167
Current income tax expense 65 294 395
Deferred income tax (benefit) expense:
U.S. federal (315) (53) (273)
State (65) (9) (25)
Foreign (108) (29) (10)
Deferred income tax (benefit) expense (488) (91) (308)
Income tax (benefit) expense $ (423) $ 203 $ 87

We reduced our current income tax payable by $1 million, $60 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 for tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation.
Deferred Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the significant components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:

 December 31,
----------------------------------------------- ------------- ----- - -----
 2020 2019
 (In millions)
Deferred tax assets:
Provision for accrued expenses $ 91 $ 100
Deferred loyalty rewards 180 183
Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 654 100
Stock-based compensation 70 86
Property and equipment 54 102
Operating lease liabilities 135 136
Other 172 72
Total deferred tax assets 1,356 779
Less valuation allowance (216) (77)
Net deferred tax assets $ 1,140 $ 702
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets (422) (485)
Operating lease ROU assets (126) (128)
Total deferred tax liabilities $ (548) $ (613)
Net deferred tax assets $ 592 $ 89

As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $1.8 billion, $733 million and $1.4 billion. U.S. federal NOLs of $1.8 billion may be carried forward indefinitely, and U.S. federal NOLs of $20 million expire at various times starting from 2034. State NOLs of $110 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and state NOLs of $623 million expire at various times starting from 2021. Foreign NOLs of $272 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and foreign NOLs of $1.1 billion expire at various times starting from 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, we have a valuation allowance of approximately $216 million related to certain tax attribute carryforwards for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. The valuation allowance increased by $139 million from the amount recorded as of December 31, 2019 primarily due to the absence of potential capital gains necessary to use capital loss carryforwards. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, may be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income increase, taxable income of the appropriate character is forecasted, capital gains are realized or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative GAAP losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
Due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits in 2017, the majority of previously unremitted earnings have been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. To the extent the repatriation resulted in differences between the GAAP and tax carrying values of Expedia Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries whose offshore earnings are not indefinitely reinvested, or to the extent future distributions from these subsidiaries will be taxable, a deferred tax liability has been accrued. The amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the United States, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $85 million as of December 31, 2020. The unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $22 million as of December 31, 2020.
Reconciliation of U.S. Federal Statutory Income Tax Rate to Effective Income Tax Rate
A reconciliation of amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes to total income tax expense is as follows:

 Year Ended December 31,
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------- ---- --- - ---
 2020 2019 2018
 (In millions)
Income tax (benefit) expense at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% $ (662) $ 163 $ 102
Foreign tax rate differential 16 40 (42)
U.S. federal research and development credit (24) (25) (23)
Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation 6 (13) (10)
Unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 36 17 23
Change in valuation allowance 139 (3) 8
Return to provision true-ups (20) (12) (7)
trivago stock-based compensation 5 7 7
State taxes (48) 22 11
Non-deductible goodwill impairment 170 — 16
Deferral of capital losses (53) — —
Global intangible low-taxed income — — 13
Foreign-derived intangible income — (14) (38)
Other, net 12 21 27
Income tax (benefit) expense $ (423) $ 203 $ 87

Our effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to valuation allowances and nondeductible impairments measured against a pre-tax loss. Our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we did not record a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions, primarily Switzerland, where the statutory income tax rate is lower, as well as excess tax benefits relating to stock-based payments, and foreign-derived intangible income.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Interest
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits and interest is as follows:

 2020 2019 2018
------------------------------------------------------ ---- ------------- --- --- - ---
 (In millions)
Balance, beginning of year $ 305 $ 293 $ 261
Increases to tax positions related to the current year 16 12 24
Increases to tax positions related to prior years 18 5 2
Decreases to tax positions related to prior years (2) — —
Reductions due to lapsed statute of limitations (4) (2) (2)
Settlements during current year — (11) —
Interest and penalties 12 8 8
Balance, end of year $ 345 $ 305 $ 293

As of December 31, 2020, we had $345 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $219 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2019, we had $305 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $188 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2018, we had $293 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $180 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total gross interest and penalties accrued was $49 million and $37 million, respectively. We recognized interest expense of $12 million in 2020 and $8 million in 2019 as well as 2018 in connection with our unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company is routinely audited by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities. These audits include questioning the timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining Expedia Group’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the periods ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2016. The Company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, until September 30, 2021 related to the 2011 to 2013 tax years, and until December 31, 2021 related to the 2014 to 2016 tax years. As of December 31, 2020, for the Expedia Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries group, statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2019 remain open to examination in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. For the HomeAway and Orbitz groups, the tax years 2001 through 2015 remain subject to examination in the U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions due to NOL carryforwards.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years. The proposed adjustments would increase our U.S. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in U.S. federal tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. We do not agree with the position of the IRS. We filed a protest with the IRS for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and Appeals returned the case to Exam for further review. We are also under examination by the IRS for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. Subsequent years remain open to examination by the IRS. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.

NOTE 11 — Capital Stock
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares of common stock with par value of $0.0001 per share, and 400 million shares of Class B common stock with par value of $0.0001 per share. Both classes of common stock qualify for and share equally in dividends, if declared by our Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all matters. Common stock is entitled to 1 vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of common stock, voting as a single, separate class are entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors. Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon conversion, the Class B common stock is retired and is not available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of Expedia Group, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia Group, Inc. after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock, if any, have been satisfied.
Preferred Stock and Warrants
On May 5, 2020, we completed the sale of Series A Preferred Stock (as defined below) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase our common stock (“Common Stock”) to AP Fort Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the “Apollo Purchaser”) and SLP Fort Aggregator II, L.P. and SLP V Fort Holdings II, L.P., affiliates of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (the “Silver Lake Purchasers”) pursuant to the Company’s previously announced Investment Agreements, dated as of April 23, 2020, with the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers (together, the “Investment Agreements”).
We issued and sold (1) to the Apollo Purchaser, pursuant to the Apollo Investment Agreement, 600,000 shares of the Company’s newly created Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $588 million and (2) to the Silver Lake Purchaser, pursuant to the Silver Lake Investment Agreement, 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $588 million. At closing, we paid certain fees in an aggregate amount of $12 million to affiliates of the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchaser. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investment Agreements, from and after the closing, (1) each of the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchaser designated one representative who was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) and (2) the Apollo Purchaser appointed one non-voting observer to the Board, in each case until such time as the applicable Purchaser and its Permitted Transferees (as defined in the Investment Agreements) no longer beneficially own (a) at least 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased by the applicable Purchaser under the Investment Agreement (unless the applicable Purchaser holds less than 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a result of redemptions by the Company, in which case the reference to 50% shall be replaced with a reference to 20%) and (b) Warrants and/or Common Stock for which the Warrants were exercised that represent in the aggregate and on an as exercised basis, at least 50% of the shares underlying the Warrants purchased by the applicable Purchaser under the Investment Agreement.
The Investment Agreements (including the forms of Certificate of Designations, Warrants and Registration Rights Agreement) contain other customary covenants and agreements, including certain standstill provisions and customary preemptive rights.
Certificate of Designations for Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock accrue daily on the Preference Amount (as defined below) at the then-applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below) and are payable semi-
annually in arrears. As used herein, “Dividend Rate” with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock means (a) from the closing until the day immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of the closing, 9.5% per annum, (b) beginning on each of the fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries of the closing, the then-applicable Dividend Rate shall be increased by 100 basis points on each such yearly anniversary, and (c) beginning on each of the eighth and ninth anniversaries of the closing date, the then-applicable Dividend Rate shall be increased by 150 basis points on each such yearly anniversary. The Dividend Rate is also subject to certain adjustments if the Company incurs indebtedness causing its leverage to exceed certain thresholds. Dividends are payable (a) until the third anniversary of the closing, either in cash or through an accrual of unpaid dividends (“Dividend Accrual”), at the Company’s option, (b) from the third anniversary of the closing until the sixth anniversary of the closing, either in cash or in a combination of cash and Dividend Accrual (with no more than 50% of the total amount of such Dividend being paid through a Dividend Accrual), at the Company’s option and (c) thereafter, in cash.
The Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to the common stock and the Class B common stock of the Company with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company.
At any time on or before the first anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 105% of the sum of the original liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus any Dividend Accruals (the “Preference Amount”), plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. Any time after the first anniversary of the closing but on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 103% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. Any time after the second anniversary of the closing but on or prior to the third anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 102% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. Any time after the third anniversary of the closing but on or prior to the fourth anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 101% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. At any time after the fourth anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Preference Amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date.
In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, (i) we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the then applicable redemption price, payable in cash and (ii) each holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Company to redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such holder at the then applicable redemption price, payable in cash.
The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock or Class B common stock.
Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred are entitled to vote separately as a class (as described below), whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock do not otherwise have any voting rights.
The vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, voting together as a separate class, is required in order for the Company to (i) amend, alter or repeal any provision of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificates of designations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock) in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, (ii) issue, any capital stock ranking senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock, other than certain issuances to a governmental entity in connection with a financing transaction or (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company.
The Series A Preferred Stock is classified within temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheets due to provisions that could cause the equity to be redeemable at the option of the holder. However, such events that could cause the Series A Preferred Stock to become redeemable are not considered probable of occurring. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock was $1,022 million, net of $68 million in initial discount and issuance costs as well as $110 million allocated on a relative fair value basis to the concurrently issued Warrants recorded to additional paid-in capital (as described below). The Series A Preferred Stock accumulated and paid $75 million (or $62.47 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) in total dividends during 2020.
Warrants to Purchase Company Common Stock. Pursuant to the Investment Agreements, we issued to each of (1) the Silver Lake Purchasers (in the aggregate) and (2) the Apollo Purchaser, Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $72.00 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments provided under the Warrants, including for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and dividends or distributions made by the Company on the Common Stock. The Warrants are exercisable on a net share settlement basis. The Warrants expire ten years after the closing date.
Registration Rights Agreement. In connection with and concurrently with the effective time of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreements, the Company, the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers are entitled to certain registration rights. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers are entitled to customary registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock for which the Warrants may be exercised and, from and after the fifth anniversary of the closing, the Series A Preferred Stock.
Treasury Stock
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's treasury stock was comprised of approximately 123.5 million common stock and 7.3 million Class B shares. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's treasury stock was comprised of approximately 119.6 million common stock and 7.3 million Class B shares.

NOTE 12 — Earnings Per Share
Basic Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 using the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow.
Diluted Earnings Per Share
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock used in the basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs using the treasury stock method, and (iii) other stock-based commitments.
The following table presents our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:

Other dilutive securities — 817 611
Diluted 141,414 149,884 152,889

Outstanding stock awards and common stock warrants that have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive were approximately 22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, seven million for 2019, and nine million for 2018.
The earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.

NOTE 13 — Restructuring and Related Reorganization Charges
In February 2020, we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational
efficiencies, which have resulted in headcount reductions, and, subsequently in 2020, the Company accelerated further actions to adapt our business to the current environment. As a result, we recognized $231 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2020. Based on current plans, which are subject to change, we expect total reorganization charges in 2021 of approximately $60 million. However, we continue to actively evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we will incur additional reorganization charges.
We also engaged in certain smaller scale restructure actions in 2019 to centralize and migrate certain operational functions and systems, for which we recognized $24 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges, which were primarily related to severance, benefits and professional fees. We had no restructuring charges in 2018.
The following table summarizes the restructuring and related reorganization activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the other charges primarily comprised of lease impairments and professional fees:

NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit, Purchase Obligations and Guarantees
We have commitments and obligations that include purchase obligations, guarantees and LOCs, which could potentially require our payment in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. The following table presents these commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2020:

 By Period
-------------------- ------------- --------------- ----------- ----------- ---------------- --- -- -- - -
 Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years
 (In millions)
Purchase obligations $ 1,042 $ 551 $ 452 $ 39 $ —
Guarantees 59 59 — — —
Letters of credit 32 24 5 — 3
 $ 1,133 $ 634 $ 457 $ 39 $ 3

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.
We have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries’ aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold in those countries. The authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. Our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.
Our LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above. There were no material claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of Expedia Group. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
Litigation Relating to Occupancy Taxes. One hundred one lawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. Nine lawsuits are currently active. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. To date, forty-eight of these lawsuits have been dismissed. Some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Thirty-four dismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. As a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $58 million and $48 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. Changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.
Pay-to-Play. Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. For example, on September 13, 2018, the City of San Francisco refunded all pay-to-play payments previously made by Expedia Group companies, along with accumulated interest. The $78 million refund was recorded as a gain within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations and $19 million of accumulated interest to interest income during 2018.
We are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including in the City of Los Angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.
Matters Relating to International VAT. We are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of VAT to our European Union related transactions. While we believe we comply with applicable VAT laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. In certain jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, we may be required to “pay-to-play” any VAT assessment prior to contesting its validity. While we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made.Competition and Consumer Matters. On August 23, 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or "ACCC", instituted proceedings in the Australian Federal Court against trivago. The ACCC alleged breaches of Australian Consumer Law, or "ACL," relating to trivago’s advertisements in Australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s Australian site, trivago’s strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago's Australian website. The matter went to trial in September 2019 and, on January 20, 2020, the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the ACL. On March 4, 2020, trivago filed a notice of appeal of part of that judgment at the Australian Federal Court. On November 4, 2020, the Australian Federal Court dismissed trivago's appeal. The court has yet to set a date for a separate hearing regarding penalties and other orders. We recorded the estimated probable loss associated with the proceedings in a previous period. An estimate for the reasonable possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made.

NOTE 16 – Acquisitions, Other Investments and Divestitures
2020 and 2019 Acquisition Activity
We had no acquisition activity during the year ended December 31, 2020 and nominal acquisition activity during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to NOTE 17 – Liberty Expedia Holdings Transaction for details of this transaction completed during 2019.
2018 Acquisition and Other Investment Activity
During 2018, we completed two business combinations. The following summarizes the aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions, in millions:

Goodwill $ 31
----------------------------------- --- --
Intangibles with definite lives (1) 24
Deferred tax liabilities, net (1)
Total (2) $ 54

___________________________________
(1)Acquired intangible assets with definite lives had a weighted average useful life of 2.9 years.
(2)Included cash acquired of $1 million.
The goodwill recorded for the business combinations was not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations were immaterial from the transaction close dates through December 31, 2018.
Other Investments. In December 2018, we made an additional investment of $70 million in Traveloka Holding Limited ("Traveloka"), a Southeast Asian online travel company, for which we made an initial investment during 2017. The initial investment in July 2017 of $350 million expanded our partnership to include deeper cooperation on hotel supply between our two companies. The majority of our investments are accounted for as a minority equity investment and included within long-term investment and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets with a small portion of the initial investment allocated to intangible assets.
2020 Disposition Activity
During the third quarter of 2020, in connection with our efforts to focus on our core businesses and streamline our activities, we committed to a plan that we think is probable of completion within the next year to divest certain smaller businesses within our Retail segment, one of which completed its sale in October 2020 and one we expect to complete in March 2021.
We recognized a loss of $13 million within other, net in the consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2020 with respect to the sale of the disposal group which completed in October 2020.
As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2020, the related assets and liabilities of these disposal groups were considered held-for-sale and, for the business that remains as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020, consists of the following:
•Held-for-sale assets of $21 million, which were primarily classified within cash of $5 million, accounts receivable of $2 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12 million.
•Held-for-sale liabilities of $53 million, which were primarily classified within merchant accounts payable of $8 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $5 million and deferred merchant bookings of $38 million.In May 2020, we completed the sale of Bodybuilding.com, and the impacts of the divestiture are not considered material to the Company.

During 2018, we completed two business combinations. The following summarizes the aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions, in millions:

NOTE 17 – Liberty Expedia Holdings Transaction
On July 26, 2019, Expedia Group acquired all of the outstanding shares of Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (“Liberty Expedia Holdings”) in a merger transaction in which the outstanding shares of Liberty Expedia Holdings’ Series A common stock and Series B common stock were exchanged for newly issued shares of common stock of Expedia Group with a fair value of $2.9 billion, assumption of $400 million in debt and $15 million of cash. We accounted for the acquired Liberty Expedia Holdings assets and liabilities, except for the Expedia Group shares repurchased, as a business combination. We accounted for the acquired Expedia Group shares held by Liberty Expedia Holdings as a share repurchase for consideration of $3.2 billion. As a result of this transaction, Expedia Group’s shares outstanding were reduced by approximately 3.1 million shares. The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination was $96 million, which was primarily comprised of $78 million of cash and $10 million of a trade name definite lived intangible asset related to Bodybuilding.com. Bodybuilding.com is primarily an Internet retailer of dietary supplements, sports nutrition products, and other health and wellness products. No goodwill was recorded for the portion of the transaction accounted for as a business combination.
In connection with the Liberty Expedia Holdings transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Expedia Group, Inc. (“Merger LLC”) assumed the obligations of Liberty Expedia Holdings with respect to the $400 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2047 issued by Liberty Expedia Holdings (the “Exchangeable Debentures”) and the indenture governing the Exchangeable Debentures. Also in connection with the Liberty Expedia Holdings transaction, Liberty Expedia Holdings delivered a notice of redemption with respect to the Exchangeable Debentures, pursuant to which Merger LLC would redeem all of the Exchangeable Debentures at a redemption price, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) the adjusted principal amount of such Exchangeable Debentures, (ii) any accrued and unpaid interest on such Exchangeable Debentures to the redemption date, and (iii) any final period distribution on such Exchangeable Debentures (subject to the right of holders of the Exchangeable Debentures to exchange such Exchangeable Debentures for equity of Expedia Group, Inc. or, at Merger LLC’s election, cash or a combination of such equity and cash). On August 26, 2019, Merger LLC redeemed all of the Exchangeable Debentures in exchange for a total payment of approximately $401 million (with no holders of the Exchangeable Debentures electing to exchange).
Bodybuilding.com was consolidated into our financial statements starting on the acquisition date and we recognized $58 million in revenue and $7 million in operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was included within Corporate and Eliminations in our segment footnote.

NOTE 18 — Related Party Transactions
Mr. Diller is the Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia Group. Certain relationships between Mr. Diller and the Company in connection with the Liberty Expedia Transaction (as defined below) are described below.
Prior to the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction on July 26, 2019, Liberty Expedia Holdings and its subsidiaries held 11,076,672 shares of Expedia Group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of Expedia Group Class B common stock, which shares represented approximately 53% of the total voting power of all shares of Expedia Group common stock and Class B common stock, based on a total of 136,832,712 shares of Expedia Group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of July 12, 2019. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement between Liberty Expedia and Mr. Diller (as amended as of November 4, 2016, the “Stockholders Agreement”), Mr. Diller generally had the right to vote all shares of Expedia Group common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty Expedia Holdings and its subsidiaries (the “Diller Proxy”). As described below, the Stockholders Agreement, including the Diller Proxy, was terminated on July 26, 2019, upon the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction.
Merger Agreement
On April 15, 2019, Expedia Group entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 5, 2019, the “Merger Agreement”) with Liberty Expedia Holdings, LEMS I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger LLC”), and LEMS II Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger LLC (“Merger Sub”) and certain other related agreements (the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and related agreements, the “Liberty Expedia Transaction”). The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into Liberty Expedia Holdings (the “Merger”), with Liberty Expedia Holdings surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger LLC, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, the merger of Liberty Expedia Holdings (as the surviving corporation
in the Merger) with and into Merger LLC (the “Upstream Merger”, and together with the Merger, the “Combination”), with Merger LLC surviving the Upstream Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
On July 26, 2019, the Combination was completed. At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Series A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Liberty Expedia Holdings (the “Liberty Expedia Series A common stock”) and each share of Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Liberty Expedia Holdings (the “Liberty Expedia Series B common stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares held by Liberty Expedia Holdings as treasury stock or held directly by Expedia Group) was converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Expedia Group common stock such that each holder of record of shares of Liberty Expedia Series A common stock or Liberty Expedia Series B common stock had the right to receive, in the aggregate, a number of shares of Expedia Group common stock equal to the product of the total number of shares of such series of Liberty Expedia Series A common stock and Liberty Expedia Series B common stock held of record by such holder immediately prior to the Merger multiplied by an exchange ratio equal to 0.36, with such product rounded up to the next whole share of Expedia Group common stock. The aggregate consideration payable in the Combination was approximately 20.7 million shares of Expedia Group common stock.
Voting Agreement
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, John C. Malone and Leslie Malone (together, the “Malone Group”) entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with the Company on April 15, 2019, pursuant to which, at the July 26, 2019 meeting of the Liberty Expedia Holdings stockholders at which the Merger was approved, the Malone Group voted shares of Liberty Expedia common stock representing approximately 32% of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Liberty Expedia Holdings common stock as of April 30, 2019, as reported in Liberty Expedia Holdings’ Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed on June 26, 2019, in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Exchange Agreement
Simultaneously with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Mr. Diller, The Diller Foundation d/b/a The Diller - von Furstenberg Family Foundation (the “Family Foundation”), Liberty Expedia Holdings and the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement,” the rights contemplated by which and by the Governance Agreement (as defined below) were agreed by Mr. Diller to be deemed to be in recognition and in lieu of Mr. Diller’s existing rights under the Former Governance Agreement (as defined below) and the Stockholders Agreement), and pursuant to which on July 26, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of the Combination, Mr. Diller and the Family Foundation exchanged with Liberty Expedia Holdings 5,523,452 shares of Expedia Group common stock for the same number of shares of Expedia Group Class B common stock held by Liberty Expedia Holdings (the shares of Class B common stock acquired by Mr. Diller and the Family Foundation pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, collectively referred to as the “Original Shares”). The Original Shares represent approximately 29% of the total voting power of all shares of Expedia Group common stock and Class B common stock, based on approximately 138 million shares of Expedia Group common stock and approximately 5.5 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Former Governance Agreement
During 2018 through July 26, 2019, Liberty Expedia Holdings (as assignee of Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate”)) was a party to the Amended and Restated Governance Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011, as amended, among the Company, Liberty Expedia Holdings and Mr. Diller (the “Former Governance Agreement”), pursuant to which Liberty Expedia Holdings had the right to nominate up to a number of directors equal to 20% of the total number of the directors on the Board (rounded up to the next whole number if the number of directors on the Board were not an even multiple of five) and had certain rights regarding committee participation, so long as Liberty Expedia Holdings satisfied certain stock ownership requirements. The Former Governance Agreement was terminated on July 26, 2019 upon the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction, at which time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the three directors serving on the Expedia Group Board of Directors who were nominated by Liberty Expedia Holdings resigned from the Board.
New Governance Agreement
Simultaneously with the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company and Mr. Diller entered into a Second Amended and Restated Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement,” the rights contemplated by which and by the Exchange Agreement were agreed by Mr. Diller to be deemed to be in recognition and in lieu of Mr. Diller’s existing rights under the Former Governance Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement), which provided, among other things, that Mr. Diller could exercise a right (the “Purchase/Exchange Right”) during the nine month period following the closing of the Combination, to acquire up to 7,276,547 shares of Expedia Group Class B common stock by (1) exchange with the Company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) for an equivalent number of shares of Expedia Group common stock, or (2) purchase from the Company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) at a price per share equal to the average closing price of Expedia Group common stock for the five
trading days immediately preceding notice of exercise (any shares acquired pursuant to the Purchase/Exchange Right, the “Additional Shares”). The Purchase/Exchange Right could be exercised from time to time in whole or in part.
On April 10, 2020, the Company and Mr. Diller entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Governance Agreement Amendment”) to the New Governance Agreement. The Governance Agreement Amendment was entered into pursuant to the stipulation and order entered by the Delaware Court of Chancery on March 30, 2020 (the “Order”), and was approved by the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company formed to, among other things, investigate and evaluate the claims raised against certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and officers of the Company in the consolidated action captioned In re Expedia Group Stockholders Litigation, Consolidated Case No. 2019-0494-JTL (the “Delaware Litigation”). Pursuant to the Order, Mr. Diller was not permitted to exercise the Purchase/Exchange Right prior to the Special Litigation Committee notifying Mr. Diller that it had completed its investigation of the claims raised in the Delaware Litigation (the “Completion Date”). The Governance Agreement Amendment extended the deadline by which Mr. Diller may have exercised the Purchase/Exchange Right to December 7, 2020 (the close of business on the forty-fifth day following the Completion Date). The Purchase/Exchange Right expired unexercised on December 7, 2020.
Subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of Original Shares may (and no holder of Additional Shares would have been permitted to) participate in, or vote in favor of, or tender shares into, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares or voting power of capital stock of the Company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of Class B common stock and shares of Expedia Group common stock. These requirements negotiated by the Expedia Group Special Committee and agreed to by Mr. Diller under the Governance Agreement did not exist under the Former Governance Agreement.
At the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Company’s stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to reflect the aforementioned transfer restrictions, automatic conversion provisions and change-of-control restrictions reflected in the Governance Agreement. The amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on December 3, 2019, and became effective at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 3, 2019.
Following the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction, the Company ceased to be a controlled company under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules and is required to comply with all of Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements. While it is possible that Mr. Diller may at some point in the future beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding voting power of the Company, the provisions of the Governance Agreement and the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that, subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of Original Shares may participate in, or vote or tender in favor of, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of Expedia Group Class B common stock and shares of Expedia Group common stock.
Other Agreements
Simultaneously with the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement, certain additional related agreements were entered into, including:
A Stockholders Agreement Termination Agreement by and among Mr. Diller, Liberty Expedia Holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Liberty Expedia Holdings, pursuant to which the Stockholders Agreement, including the Diller Proxy, terminated on July 26, 2019, upon the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction;
A Governance Agreement Termination Agreement, by and among Mr. Diller, the Company, Liberty Expedia Holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Liberty Expedia Holdings, pursuant to which the Former Governance Agreement terminated on July 26, 2019, upon the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction;
An Assumption and Joinder Agreement to Tax Sharing Agreement by and among the Company, Liberty Expedia Holdings and Qurate, pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction, Liberty Expedia Holdings’ rights and obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2016, by and between Qurate and Liberty Expedia Holdings;
An Assumption Agreement Concerning Transaction Agreement Obligations by and among the Company, Liberty Expedia Holdings, Qurate and the Malone Group, pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the Liberty Expedia Transaction, certain of Liberty Expedia Holdings’ rights and obligations under the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2016, as amended by the letter agreement dated as of March 6, 2018, as further amended by Amendment No. 2 to Transaction Agreement, dated as of April 15, 2019 (the “Transaction Agreement”), which survived the termination of the Transaction Agreement; and
An Assumption and Joinder Agreement to Reorganization Agreement by and among the Company, Liberty Expedia Holdings and Qurate, pursuant to which the Company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the Liberty Expedia
Transaction, Liberty Expedia Holdings’ rights and obligations under the Reorganization Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2016, by and between Qurate and Liberty Expedia Holdings.
IAC/InterActiveCorp
In addition to serving as our Chairman and Senior Executive, Mr. Diller also serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive at IAC. The Company and IAC are related parties, insofar as Mr. Diller serves as Chairman and Senior Executive of both Expedia Group and IAC. Each of IAC and Expedia Group has a 50% ownership interest in two aircraft that may be used by both companies. We share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the planes; direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. In addition, in April 2019, Expedia Group and IAC entered into an agreement to jointly acquire a new corporate aircraft for a total expected cost of approximately $72 million (including purchase and related costs), which will be split evenly between the two companies. In 2019, we paid $23 million (50% of the purchase price and refurbishment costs paid to date) for our interest. 2020 payments were nominal. The respective share of the balance is due upon delivery of the new aircraft, which is expected to occur in early 2021. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net basis in our ownership interest in the planes was $50 million and $53 million, respectively, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the airplanes were nominal.

NOTE 19 — Segment Information
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we have the following reportable segments: Retail, B2B, and trivago. The change from our previous reportable segments, Core OTA, trivago, Vrbo and Egencia, reflect Expedia Group’s efforts to simplify our organization into a platform operating model by aligning our retail brand operations, combining our business focused brands and centralizing our platform and supply organizations to support all of our businesses. Our Retail segment, which consists of the aggregation of operating segments, provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com and Hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and Hotels.com websites throughout the world, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire.com, CarRentals.com, Expedia Cruises and Classic Vacations. Our B2B segment is comprised of our Expedia Business Services organization including Expedia Partner Solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-party company branded websites, and Egencia, a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
We determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our Retail and B2B segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, certain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.
Our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our Retail segment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and therefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within Corporate and Eliminations in the table below.
Corporate and Eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses as well as Bodybuilding.com subsequent to our acquisition in July 2019 through its sale in May 2020. In addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items excluded from segment operating performance in Corporate and Eliminations. Such amounts are detailed in our segment reconciliation below.
The following tables present our segment information for 2020, 2019 and 2018. As a significant portion of our property and equipment is not allocated to our operating segments and depreciation is not included in our segment measure, we do not report the assets by segment as it would not be meaningful. We do not regularly provide such information to our chief operating decision makers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Term Loan In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan ("Term Loan") with a maturity date of April 30, 2020. The Term Loan ranked equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. There were no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the Term Loan could be prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. The related issuance costs were amortized to interest expense over the Term Loan period using the effective interest method. Interest was payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elec...

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from analyt...

Note 18. Segment Reporting We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments: *Latin America *AMEA *Europe *North America 124 We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. Our segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were: ------------- -------------------------------- ------ ---- ----- ---- ------ ------ - ------ F...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79 ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

[") issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This new standard eliminates certain exceptions in current guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Investments - equity securities; Investments - The standards update is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. Specifically, the standard simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP, removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it, and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The standards update is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2020 but the guidance must be adopted as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We plan to early adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2021 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net forward liabilities of $14 million ($23 million gross forward liability) and $8 million ($30 million gross forward liability) recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We recorded $74 million, $(8) million and $47 million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

[") is currently examining Expedia Group’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the periods ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2016. The Company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, until September 30, 2021 related to the 2011 to 2013 tax years, and until December 31, 2021 related to the 2014 to 2016 tax years. As of December 31, 2020, for the Expedia Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries group, statute of limitations for to examination in the U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions due to NOL carryforwards.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years. The proposed adjustments would increase our U.S. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in U.S. federal tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. We do not agree with the position of the IRS. We filed a protest with the IRS for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and Appeals returned the case to Exam for further review. We are also under examination by the IRS for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. Subsequent years remain open to examination by the IRS. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.

NOTE 11 — Capital Stock
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares of common stock with par value of $0.0001 per share, and 400 million shares of Class B common stock with par value of $0.0001 per share. Both classes of common stock qualify for and share equally in dividends, if declared by our Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all matters. Common stock is entitled to 1 vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of common stock, voting as a single, separate class are entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors. Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon conversion, the Class B common stock is retired and is not available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of Expedia Group, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia Group, Inc. after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock, if any, have been satisfied.
Preferred Stock and Warrants
On May 5, 2020, we completed the sale of Series A Preferred Stock (as defined below) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase our common stock (“Common Stock”) to AP Fort Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the “Apollo Purchaser”) and SLP Fort Aggregator II, L.P. and SLP V Fort Holdings II, L.P., affiliates of Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (the “Silver Lake Purchasers”) pursuant to the Company’s previously announced Investment Agreements, dated as of April 23, 2020, with the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers (together, the “Investment Agreements”).
We issued and sold (1) to the Apollo Purchaser, pursuant to the Apollo Investment Agreement, 600,000 shares of the Company’s newly created Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $588 million and (2) to the Silver Lake Purchaser, pursuant to the Silver Lake Investment Agreement, 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $588 million. At closing, we paid certain fees in an aggregate amount of $12 million to affiliates of the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchaser. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investment Agreements, from and after the closing, (1) each of the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchaser designated one representative who was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) and (2) the Apollo Purchaser appointed one non-voting observer to the Board, in each case until such time as the applicable Purchaser and its Permitted Transferees (as defined in the Investment Agreements) no longer beneficially own (a) at least 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased by the applicable Purchaser under the Investment Agreement (unless the applicable Purchaser holds less than 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as a result of redemptions by the Company, in which case the reference to 50% shall be replaced with a reference to 20%) and (b) Warrants and/or Common Stock for which the Warrants were exercised that represent in the aggregate and on an as exercised basis, at least 50% of the shares underlying the Warrants purchased by the applicable Purchaser under the Investment Agreement.
The Investment Agreements (including the forms of Certificate of Designations, Warrants and Registration Rights Agreement) contain other customary covenants and agreements, including certain standstill provisions and customary preemptive rights.
Certificate of Designations for Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock accrue daily on the Preference Amount (as defined below) at the then-applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below) and are payable semi-
annually in arrears. As used herein, “Dividend Rate” with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock means (a) from the closing until the day immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of the closing, 9.5% per annum, (b) beginning on each of the fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries of the closing, the then-applicable Dividend Rate shall be increased by 100 basis points on each such yearly anniversary, and (c) beginning on each of the eighth and ninth anniversaries of the closing date, the then-applicable Dividend Rate shall be increased by 150 basis points on each such yearly anniversary. The Dividend Rate is also subject to certain adjustments if the Company incurs indebtedness causing its leverage to exceed certain thresholds. Dividends are payable (a) until the third anniversary of the closing, either in cash or through an accrual of unpaid dividends (“Dividend Accrual”), at the Company’s option, (b) from the third anniversary of the closing until the sixth anniversary of the closing, either in cash or in a combination of cash and Dividend Accrual (with no more than 50% of the total amount of such Dividend being paid through a Dividend Accrual), at the Company’s option and (c) thereafter, in cash.
The Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to the common stock and the Class B common stock of the Company with respect to dividend rights, redemption rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company.
At any time on or before the first anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 105% of the sum of the original liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus any Dividend Accruals (the “Preference Amount”), plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. Any time after the first anniversary of the closing but on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 103% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. Any time after the second anniversary of the closing but on or prior to the third anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to 102% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions in cash at a price equal to 101% of the Preference Amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. At any time after the fourth anniversary of the closing, we may redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Preference Amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date.
In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control, (i) we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the then applicable redemption price, payable in cash and (ii) each holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Company to redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such holder at the then applicable redemption price, payable in cash.
The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock or Class B common stock.
Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have one vote per share on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred are entitled to vote separately as a class (as described below), whether at a meeting or by written consent. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock do not otherwise have any voting rights.
The vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time, voting together as a separate class, is required in order for the Company to (i) amend, alter or repeal any provision of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificates of designations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock) in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, (ii) issue, any capital stock ranking senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock, other than certain issuances to a governmental entity in connection with a financing transaction or (iii) liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company.
The Series A Preferred Stock is classified within temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheets due to provisions that could cause the equity to be redeemable at the option of the holder. However, such events that could cause the Series A Preferred Stock to become redeemable are not considered probable of occurring. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Series A Preferred Stock was $1,022 million, net of $68 million in initial discount and issuance costs as well as $110 million allocated on a relative fair value basis to the concurrently issued Warrants recorded to additional paid-in capital (as described below). The Series A Preferred Stock accumulated and paid $75 million (or $62.47 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) in total dividends during 2020.
Warrants to Purchase Company Common Stock. Pursuant to the Investment Agreements, we issued to each of (1) the Silver Lake Purchasers (in the aggregate) and (2) the Apollo Purchaser, Warrants to purchase 4.2 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $72.00 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments provided under the Warrants, including for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and dividends or distributions made by the Company on the Common Stock. The Warrants are exercisable on a net share settlement basis. The Warrants expire ten years after the closing date.
Registration Rights Agreement. In connection with and concurrently with the effective time of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreements, the Company, the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers are entitled to certain registration rights. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Apollo Purchaser and the Silver Lake Purchasers are entitled to customary registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock for which the Warrants may be exercised and, from and after the fifth anniversary of the closing, the Series A Preferred Stock.
