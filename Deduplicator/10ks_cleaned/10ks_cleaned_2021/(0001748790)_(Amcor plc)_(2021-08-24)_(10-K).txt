Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," for more information on our credit rating profile.

In addition, a significant number of our operating subsidiaries are not guarantors of our indebtedness. In the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, the assets of such subsidiary will be used to satisfy the claims of its creditors. The non-guarantor subsidiaries have no direct obligations in respect of our indebtedness and therefore a direct claim against any non-guarantor subsidiary and any claims to enforce payment on our indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Hedging — Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.

    We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floating-rate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations. The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time. If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks, if we are under-hedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations.

Goodwill and other intangible assets — A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.

    As of June 30, 2021, we had $7.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate. See "Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Internal Controls — We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

    As a newly listed NYSE public company in 2019, we elected the transition period for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and we were exempt from Section 404 compliance until we filed our second Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical Australian Accounting Standards financial statements to U.S. GAAP. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We have fully remediated this material weakness as of June 30, 2020. We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key Information Technology ("IT") systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information. We fully remediated this material weakness as of June 30, 2021, see "Item 9A, Controls and Procedures," for further information.

    There can be no assurance that we will not identify new material weaknesses in the future. Any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confidence, and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.

Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face.

    We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with third-party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover a variety of risk exposures, including property damage. Although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice, they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels in the future.

    Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in Singapore. Our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups, and assumes specific risks relating to various risk exposures, including property damage. The captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captive's reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations.

Legal and Compliance Risks

Litigation — Litigation, including product liability claims, or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations, and financial performance.

We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Given our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Refer to "Item 3. - Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.

There is an increased scrutiny from shareholders, customers, and governments on corporate ESG practices. Our commitment to sustainability and ESG practices remains at the core of our business. However, our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our large, global

20

customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to support customers in achieving these reductions, customers may seek out competitors who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all parties could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may result in increased expenditures for environmental controls or new taxes on the products we produce.

Environmental, health, and safety regulations — Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters may adversely affect our company.

    Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation, including regulations related to plastic packaging, could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost, increased energy and freight costs and new taxes on packaging products. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. Government bans of certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to Amcor's business. Mandates to use certain types of materials, such as post-consumer recycled ("PCR") content, may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for those materials as current recycling rates are insufficient to meet increased demand for PCR within and beyond the packaging industry.

 We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws and regulations are complex and the determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. We are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. Our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate. In addition, certain tax policy efforts, including the U.S. corporate income tax rate increase proposed by the new U.S. administration and any tax law changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") and the G20's inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing ("BEPS"), could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense.

Patents and proprietary technology — Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop, acquire, and retain intellectual property rights.

    Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer. Our pending patent applications, and our pending trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. In addition, our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.

Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares

Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S. corporations.

21

    We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law, including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and by the Amcor Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time. These rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.

U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us.

    A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the United States upon those non-U.S. directors and officers, or to enforce judgments realized in the United States.

    Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S., including those in Australia and Jersey, may be subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., including Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the securities laws of the U.S. Additionally, our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us, the Royal Court of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers, actions arising out of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. However, there is uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.

Overview

    Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2021, approximately 46,000 Amcor employees generated $12.9 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 225 locations in over 40 countries.

Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented

Impact of COVID-19

    The ongoing 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic has resulted in a period of historic uncertainty and challenges with the extent and severity of the pandemic continuing to vary among the various regions in which we operate. Our business is almost entirely exposed to end markets which have demonstrated the same resilience experienced through past economic cycles. Our operations have been largely recognized as 'essential' by governments and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles focusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running, and contributing to relief efforts in our communities.

Health and Safety

    Our commitment to the health and safety of our employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms, frequent disinfecting of our locations, and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers, and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for our business.

Operations and Supply Chain

    To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response, return to work protocols, and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. Our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including temporary closures of our facilities. We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date attributed to COVID-19.

Contributions to Our Communities

    To support our local communities, we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education or food, and other essential products.

Looking Ahead

    We continue to believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results. Recent outbreaks of variants of the virus have resulted in increased government actions to contain the pandemic. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions, as well as the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.

27

Raw Material and Supply Chain Trends

We experienced supply shortages of certain resins and raw materials and increased price volatility of certain raw materials across many of the regions in which we operate for both of our reportable segments in the second half of fiscal 2021 attributed to a variety of global factors, including significant winter storms across the southern United States. We have been able to work closely with our suppliers and customers, leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply and other resulting issues to date. We expect supplies of certain raw materials will continue to be tight through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 as supply channels recover, barring any future weather or other impacts.

The Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.

    On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the United States, for the purchase price of $5.2 billion in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of debt.

2019 Bemis Integration Plan

    In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As previously announced, we continue to target realizing at least $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022.

    Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $230 million to $240 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include approximately $190 million to $200 million of restructuring and related expenses, net, and $40 million of general integration expenses. We estimate that net cash expenditures including disposal proceeds will be approximately $160 million to $170 million, of which $40 million relates to general integration expense. As of June 30, 2021, we have incurred $135 million in employee related expenses, $38 million in fixed asset related expenses, $26 million in other restructuring and $27 million in restructuring related expenses, partially offset by a gain on disposal of a business of $51 million. The year ended June 30, 2021 resulted in net cash inflows of $1 million, including $78 million of business disposal proceeds, offset by $77 million of cash outflows, of which $69 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2022.

    Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. We believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of the 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment, and anticipated losses on sale of closed facilities.

2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan

    On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint. The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements, as well as overhead cost reductions.

    The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan was completed by June 30, 2021 with total pre-tax restructuring costs of $121 million, whereof $78 million resulted in cash expenditures, with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs.

For more information about our restructuring plans, refer to Note 6, "Restructuring Plans" of "Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

Equity Method Investment - AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG")

    We sold our equity method investment in AMVIG on September 30, 2020, realizing a net gain of $15 million, which was recorded in equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax in the consolidated statements of income. Prior to the sale and due to impairment indicators being present for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of our investment in AMVIG at the end of each period, including interim periods, to the fair

28

value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. We recorded impairment charges in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of $26 million and $14 million, respectively, as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value. Refer to Note 7, "Equity Method and Other Investments."

Highly Inflationary Accounting

    We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the U.S. dollar. The transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact on monetary balances of $19 million, $28 million, and $30 million that was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

29

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of changes in the financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. A discussion and analysis regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, filed with the SEC on August 27, 2020.

Consolidated Results of Operations

--------------------------------------------- ----- ------ ---- --- - ------
(in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020
Net sales $ 12,861 $ 12,468
Operating income 1,321 994
Operating income as a percentage of net sales 10.3 % 8.0 %

Net income attributable to Amcor plc $ 939 $ 612
Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.602 $ 0.382

    Net sales increased by $393 million, or 3.2%, to $12,861 million for the fiscal year 2021, from $12,468 million for the fiscal year 2020. Excluding the impact of disposed operations of $66 million, or (0.5%), positive currency impacts of $190 million, or 1.5%, and pass-through of raw material costs of $3 million, or 0.0%, the increase in net sales for the fiscal year 2021 was $273 million or 2.2%, driven by favorable volumes of 1.6% and favorable price/mix of 0.6%.

    Net income attributable to Amcor plc increased by $327 million, or 53.4%, to $939 million for the fiscal year 2021, from $612 million for the fiscal year 2020 mainly as a result of gross profit margin improvement, Bemis acquisition related synergies, nonrecurrence of Bemis acquisition related costs incurred in fiscal year 2020, and reduced interest expense, partially offset by associated tax charges.

    Diluted earnings per shares ("Diluted EPS") increased to $0.602, or by 57.5%, for the fiscal year 2021, from $0.382 for the fiscal year 2020, with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders increasing by 53.4% and the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding decreasing by 2.9%. The decrease in the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding was due to repurchase of shares under announced share buyback programs.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information

    This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"): adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing operations, adjusted net income from continuing operations, and net debt. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reforms, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments.

 This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined under U.S. GAAP. We use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources.

    Despite the existing market uncertainties and volatilities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on our current and expected cash flow from operating activities and available cash, we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market back stopped by our bank facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future.

Overview

--------------------------------------------------- ------------------- ----- ---- ------- -------------------- ----- ----- - --
 Year Ended June 30,
(in millions) 2021 2020 Change 2021 vs. 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,461 $ 1,384 $ 77
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (233) 38 (271)
Net cash used in financing activities (1,179) (1,236) 57

Cash Flow Overview

 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

    Net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by $77 million, or 6%, to $1,461 million for fiscal year 2021, from $1,384 million for fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher cash earnings in fiscal year 2021 partially offset by working capital outflows versus the prior fiscal year.

 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities

    Net cash flows from investing activities decreased by $271 million, or 713%, to a $233 million outflow for fiscal year 2021, from a $38 million inflow for fiscal year 2020. This decrease was primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the divestiture of three Bemis' medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") in the prior period and higher capital expenditures in the current period.

    Capital expenditures were $468 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of $68 million compared to $400 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the increased capital spending in the Flexibles segment.

 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

    Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $57 million, or 5%, to $1,179 million for fiscal year 2021, from a $1,236 million outflow for fiscal year 2020. This decrease was primarily due to lower share buyback payments and on-market purchases of own shares, partially offset by lower cash net debt drawdowns.

Net Debt

    We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.

    Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of the long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.

37

    Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to a range between 7.5% to 15.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of June 30, 2021, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt.

    Our net debt as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 was $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.

Available Financing

    As of June 30, 2021, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $2.0 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by three separate bank syndicates.

During the quarter ending March 31, 2021, we extended $3.8 billion in aggregate amount of the 3-, 4-, and 5-year revolving credit facilities via a one-year extension option to April 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. In addition to extending maturities, we also amended credit terms of the revolving facilities, which, among other changes, modified the debt covenant basis. The amendments removed the financial covenant requiring compliance with a minimum net interest expense coverage ratio, increased maximum permitted leverage ratio, and permit further increases at our election after we consummate certain qualified transactions. We have an option to extend the maturities for 12 months in fiscal year 2022.

On May 28, 2021, we canceled a $400 million term loan facility following the issuance of a $800 million 10-year senior unsecured note on May 25, 2021.

On July 15, 2021, we redeemed the $400 million U.S dollar notes due in October 2021 at a price equal to the principal plus accrued interest.

    As of June 30, 2021, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $3.8 billion, of which $1.8 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities).

Dividend Payments

    In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we paid $742 million, $761 million, and $680 million, respectively, in dividends.

Credit Rating

    Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various tenors, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets and from global financial institutions.

Share Repurchases

    On November 5, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $150 million buyback of ordinary shares and Chess Depositary Instruments ("CDIs"). On February 2, 2021, our Board of Directors also approved a separate $200 million buyback of ordinary shares and CDIs in the next twelve months. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased approximately $350 million, excluding transaction costs, or 31 million shares. The shares repurchased were canceled upon repurchase. Additionally, on August 17, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a further $400 million buyback of ordinary shares and/or CDIs in the next twelve months.

    We had cash outflows of $8 million, $67 million, and $20 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards and shares purchased for shareholder settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we held treasury shares at cost of $29 million, $67 million, and $16 million, representing 2.8 million, 6.7 million, and 1.4 million shares, respectively.

    Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our business, the aim is to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. The following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:

•maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
•regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing, and financing activities;
•generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;
•maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;
•managing credit risk related to financial assets;
•monitoring the duration of long-term debt;
•only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
•to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we extended $3.8 billion in aggregate amount of our 3-, 4-, and 5-year revolving credit facilities via a one-year extension option to April 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. At the same time, we entered into amendments to our revolving credit facilities, as described above under “Available Financing.” We have an option to extend the maturities for another 12 months in fiscal year 2022.

39

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we canceled a $400 million term loan facility following the issuance of an $800 million 10-year senior unsecured note on May 25, 2021.

On July 15, 2021, we redeemed the $400 million U.S. dollar notes due in October 2021 at a price equal to the principal plus accrued interest.

    As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, was drawn under commercial paper programs. However, such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in April 2023 ($750 million), April 2024 ($1.5 billion), and April 2025 ($1.5 billion), with an option to extend, under which we had $2.0 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 2021.

    We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our capital expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed. We expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis. We decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on, among other factors, the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year. Our long-term access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, equity method investments, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

•the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities;
•valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
•calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions;
•calculation of equity method investments; and
•calculation of acquisition fair values.

Considerations Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic

    The impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated operations is uncertain. While the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns. We have considered the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgments as of June 30, 2021 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations.

Pension Costs

    Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals. The accounting for the pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relates to our defined benefit plans in the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2021 was $15 million, compared to pension cost of $10 million in fiscal year 2020 and $13 million in fiscal year 2019. We expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $3 million.

    For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates, and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions, and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.

    The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component and outside operating income.

 We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve, derived based on bond universe

41

information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland, and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields. Additionally, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.

Pension Assumptions Sensitivity Analysis

 The following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2022 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.

--------------------------------- --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- ---

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

    Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have six reporting units, of which five are included in our Flexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reportable segment is Rigid Packaging.

    Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.

    In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches. The most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.

    Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the need for more frequent assessments.

    Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks, and software and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 20 years. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.

42

Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions

    We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit. Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards if we do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Equity Accounted Investments

    Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid. The assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decline requires significant estimates. We review our investments in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Acquisitions

    We record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

    We use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions. The fair value measurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired developed technology, corporate trade name, and brand names; the period of time we expect to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.

    In estimating the future cash flows, we consider demand, competition, other economic factors, and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans. We utilize common valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and market approaches, including the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired developed technology, trade names, and brand names. Customer relationships are valued using the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method. We believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.

    In connection with a given business acquisition, we may identify pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.

 In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period.

43

 We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business acquisition. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at fair value in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the liability is incurred. We reflect acquired operations that we intend to dispose of as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. ​ Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. ​ 133 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in "Elimination of Dual Credit"). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/be...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million.

Note 8.Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Liquidity Risk and Outlook

    Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting unsecured notes, and commercial paper. The following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:

•maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
•regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing, and financing activities;
•generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;
•maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;
•managing credit risk related to financial assets;
•monitoring the duration of long-term debt;
•only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
•to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we extended $3.8 billion in aggregate amount of our 3-, 4-, and 5-year revolving credit facilities via a one-year extension option to April 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. At the same time, we entered into amendments to our revolving credit facilities, as described above under “Available Financing.” We have an option to extend the maturities for another 12 months in fiscal year 2022.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we canceled a $400 million term loan facility following the issuance of an $800 million 10-year senior unsecured note on May 25, 2021.

On July 15, 2021, we redeemed the $400 million U.S. dollar notes due in October 2021 at a price equal to the principal plus accrued interest.

    As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, was drawn under commercial paper programs. However, such programs are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in April 2023 ($750 million), April 2024 ($1.5 billion), and April 2025 ($1.5 billion), with an option to extend, under which we had $2.0 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 2021.

    We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis. We decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on, among other factors, the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year. Our long-term access to liquidity depends on both our results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, equity method investments, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

•the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities;
•valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
•calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions;
•calculation of equity method investments; and
•calculation of acquisition fair values.

Considerations Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic

    The impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated operations is uncertain. While the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns. We have considered the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgments as of June 30, 2021 and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations.

Pension Costs

    Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals. The accounting for the pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relates to our defined benefit plans in the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2021 was $15 million, compared to pension cost of $10 million in fiscal year 2020 and $13 million in fiscal year 2019. We expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $3 million.

    For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting salary inflation rates, mortality rates, and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions, and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends that were based on the critical assumptions.

    The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component and outside operating income.

 We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve, derived based on bond universe

information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland, and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields. Additionally, return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan']:

Highly Inflationary Accounting

    We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the U.S. dollar. The transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact on monetary balances of $19 million, $28 million, and $30 million that was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

    Net sales increased by $393 million, or 3.2%, to $12,861 million for the fiscal year 2021, from $12,468 million for the fiscal year 2020. Excluding the impact of disposed operations of $66 million, or (0.5%), positive currency impacts of $190 million, or 1.5%, and pass-through of raw material costs of $3 million, or 0.0%, the increase in net sales for the fiscal year 2021 was $273 million or 2.2%, driven by favorable volumes of 1.6% and favorable price/mix of 0.6%.

    Net income attributable to Amcor plc increased by $327 million, or 53.4%, to $939 million for the fiscal year 2021, from $612 million for the fiscal year 2020 mainly as a result of gross profit margin improvement, Bemis acquisition related synergies, nonrecurrence of Bemis acquisition related costs incurred in fiscal year 2020, and reduced interest expense, partially offset by associated tax charges.
