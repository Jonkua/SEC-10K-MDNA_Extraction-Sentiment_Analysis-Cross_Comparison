Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

SALE OF KWIDZYN MILL

On February 12, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell our Kwidzyn, Poland mill for €670 million (approximately $812 million) in cash, subject to final working capital and net debt adjustments. The business includes the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

On December 3, 2020, the Company announced its intention to spin off its Printing Papers business into a standalone, publicly-traded company in order to focus on its corrugated packaging and absorbent fibers businesses. The sale of Kwidzyn provides an opportunity for International Paper to achieve a premium value and significant incremental cash proceeds, but otherwise does not change its plans for the proposed spin-off.

GRAPHIC PACKAGING MONETIZATION

On February 16, 2021, the Company exchanged 15,307,000 units of the aggregate units owned by the Company for 15,307,000 shares of Graphic Packaging stock. The Company sold the shares in open market transactions for approximately $247 million. Additionally, on February 16, 2021, Graphic Packaging repurchased 9,281,316 units owned by the Company for an aggregate price of $150 million. The Company expects to recognize a gain on these two transactions and related tax expense in the first quarter 2021.

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. ​ Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. ​ 133 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in "Elimination of Dual Credit"). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/be...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Term Loan In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan ("Term Loan") with a maturity date of April 30, 2020. The Term Loan ranked equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. There were no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the Term Loan could be prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. The related issuance costs were amortized to interest expense over the Term Loan period using the effective interest method. Interest was payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elec...
