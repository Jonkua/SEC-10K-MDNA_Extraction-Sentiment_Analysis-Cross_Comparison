Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its Printing Papers business into a new, publicly-traded company, Sylvamo Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, on August 6, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Kwidzyn, Poland mill which included the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. As a result of the Sylvamo Corporation spin-off and the sale of Kwidzyn, the Company no longer has a Printing Papers segment, and all current and prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Sylvamo Corporation and Kwidzyn businesses as a discontinued operation. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate
items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its Printing Papers business into a new, publicly-traded company, Sylvamo Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, on August 6, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Kwidzyn, Poland mill which included the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. As a result of the Sylvamo Corporation spin-off and the sale of Kwidzyn, the Company no longer has a Printing Papers segment, and all current and prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Sylvamo Corporation and Kwidzyn businesses as a discontinued operation. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate
items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.
