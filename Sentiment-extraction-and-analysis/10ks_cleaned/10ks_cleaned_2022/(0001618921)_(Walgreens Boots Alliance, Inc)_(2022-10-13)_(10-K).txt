Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2021.

Net earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
Fiscal 2022 net earnings attributable to the Company were $4.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share were $5.01 compared to $2.30 for the prior year period. The increases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect a $2.5 billion after-tax gain during the three months ended November 30, 2021 due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held minority equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen in the prior fiscal year offset by the fiscal 2022 impairment charges related to intangible assets in Boots UK, and the charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in fiscal 2022.

Other income, net in fiscal 2022 was $3.0 billion compared to $558 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in other income is mainly due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and the partial sale of the Company’s equity method investments in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care Health.

Net interest expense was $400 million and $905 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of early debt extinguishments completed during fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates on remaining debt.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 0.8% benefit and 33.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pre-tax gains from the consolidation of the Company’s investments in VillageMD and Shields, for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax. Additionally, the Company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care, capital gains recognized from internal restructuring, and based on forecasted capital gains. See Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments and Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
Adjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $4.4 billion compared with the prior year period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $5.04 compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.9 percentage points as a result of currency translation.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2022 primarily reflects improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and a continued rebound in International segment sales and profitability, partly offset by a decrease in U.S. pharmacy operating results, and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT
The following information summarizes our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.

4Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.

Sales fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment’s sales for fiscal 2022 decreased by 2.6 percent to $109.1 billion, including a 650 basis point impact of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline. Comparable sales increased by 5.1 percent in fiscal 2022.

Pharmacy sales decreased by 5.3 percent in fiscal 2022, including 8.6 percentage point of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline and represented 73.7 percent of the segment’s sales. Excluding AllianceRx Walgreens, pharmacy sales increased 4.2 percent in fiscal 2022. The increase is due to brand drug inflation and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, partially offset by generic drug utilization and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2021, pharmacy sales increased 5.5 percent and represented 75.8 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 6.7 percent in fiscal 2021. Within comparable sales, prescriptions filled in fiscal 2022 increased by 1.3 percent from a year earlier, including a positive impact of approximately 12 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.3 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.5 percent in fiscal 2021. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 0.2 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.4 percent for fiscal 2021. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2 percent of prescription sales for fiscal 2022 compared to 97.5 percent for fiscal 2021. The total number of prescriptions (including vaccinations) filled in fiscal 2022 was 819.6 million compared to 827.5 million in fiscal 2021. Prescriptions (including vaccinations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,216.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 1,210.6 million in fiscal 2021.

Retail sales increased by 5.6 percent in fiscal 2022 and were 26.3 percent of the segment’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2021 retail sales decreased by 0.4 percent and comprised 24.2 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable retail sales increased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2022 and increased 1.2 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by health and wellness, including favorable impact of at-home COVID-19 tests and cough, cold and flu, as well as personal care and beauty, partially offset by the planned decline in tobacco.

Operating income fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment’s operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 13.8 percent to $2.9 billion, including income of $418 million from the Company's share of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Excluding the impact of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen, the year over year decrease in operating income was driven by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, including charges related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in the third quarter, offset by COVID-19 testing and retail gross profit growth.

Gross margin was 21.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 21.2 percent in fiscal 2021. Gross margin was positively impacted in fiscal 2022 by retail margin, offset by pharmacy margin. The increase in retail margin was primarily due to favorable rate and product mix. The decrease in pharmacy margin was primarily driven by continued reimbursement pressure.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.4 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 17.9 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase was driven by costs related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida, COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and labor investments, partially offset by savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program.

Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 0.2 percent to $5.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to retail gross profit growth and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure.

See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

International
The Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.

The International segment operates in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the segment’s results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, for further information on currency risk.

The Company presents certain information related to operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Sales fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The International segment’s sales for fiscal 2022 increased 6.5 percent to $21.8 billion. The adverse impact of currency translation on sales was 6.9 percentage points. Comparable sales in constant currency, which excludes sales from the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale combined business in Germany, increased 11.3 percent, reflecting growth across all markets. Sales in the comparable year ago-period included the adverse impact of strict COVID-19 restrictions on the UK store footfall.

Pharmacy sales decreased 2.1 percent in fiscal 2022 and represented 17.1 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 4.0 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 2.5 percent, primarily in the UK, reflecting stronger demand for pharmacy services, and pharmacy volumes in Mexico and Chile.

Retail sales increased 11.2 percent for fiscal 2022 and represented 31.7 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 5.2 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency increased 16.9 percent reflecting higher retail sales in the UK and Ireland, including a recovery in store footfall compared to a year ago-period, as COVID-19 restrictions were less severe.

Pharmaceutical wholesale sales increased 6.7 percent for fiscal 2022 and represented 51.2 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmaceutical wholesale sales was 8.9 percentage points. The increase in pharmaceutical wholesale sales reflects the full year of operations since the the formation of the combined business in Germany in fiscal 2021

Operating income fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The International segment’s operating loss for fiscal 2022 was $346 million, compared to an operating income of $227 million in fiscal 2021. Operating loss was favorably impacted by 33.0 percentage points ($75 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income is primarily due to non-cash impairment charges, related to intangible assets in Boots UK in the fourth quarter.

Gross profit increased 6.7 percent in fiscal 2022. Gross profit was adversely impacted by 5.5 percentage points ($237 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales, stronger demand for pharmacy services in the UK, and incremental gross profit associated with the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany. This was partially offset by higher NHS reimbursement levels in the year ago period.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21.0 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Expenses were favorably impacted by 7.6 percentage points ($312 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase reflects Boots UK intangible asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter, incremental expenses associated with the Company's wholesale business in Germany, increased labor costs, and the non-recurring COVID-19 related government support in the year ago period. This was partially offset by a gain in UK from a sale-leaseback transaction.

As a percentage of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.7 percent in fiscal 2022, compared to 20.0 percent in the prior fiscal year.

Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The International segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 increased $260 million to $726 million. Adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by 9.8 percentage points ($46 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily in the UK, reflecting higher retail sales following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, and stronger demand for pharmacy services. This was partially offset by increased Selling, general and administrative expenses and higher NHS pharmacy reimbursement levels in the year ago period in the UK.

See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

U.S. Healthcare
The Company’s U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.

The U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in VillageMD, a leading, national provider of value-based primary care services; a majority position in Shields, a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals; a majority position in CareCentrix, a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors, and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services and care management programs to their members and members’ caregivers through both digital and physical channels.

WBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 47

Table of Contents
Gross loss for fiscal 2022 was $22 million, reflecting results from Shields and VillageMD. Gross loss was driven by expansion at VillageMD, partly offset by further growth in existing partnerships and expanding margins at Shields.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $806 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $57 million in fiscal 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the three acquisitions as well as continued investments in the Walgreens Health organic business.

Adjusted operating loss (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
The U.S. Healthcare segment's adjusted operating loss was $370 million for fiscal 2022, reflecting the three acquisitions as well as continued investments in the Walgreens Health organic business compared to a loss of $57 million in fiscal 2021.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures herein, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.

The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

1 Adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020.
2 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments exclude the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. The stock based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.
3 Transformational Cost Management Program and Store Optimization Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.

 4 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a $683 million charge related to a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses.
 5 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.
 6 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses.
 7 The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items.
 8 Store damage and inventory losses as a result of looting in the U.S., net of insurance recoveries.
 9 Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net. We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.
10 Impairment of equity method investment and investment in equity securities includes impairment of certain investments. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business and it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis. Exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Other income, net.
11 In fiscal 2022, the Company finalized the working capital adjustments with AmerisourceBergen related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business, resulting in a $38 million charge recorded to Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a net gain of $322 million within results of discontinued operations related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business. This gain was excluded as it is not reflective of normal operating activities.
12 Includes significant gains on the sale of equity method investments. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $417 million and $145 million in Other income, net due to a partial sale of its equity method investments in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care Health, respectively. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $290 million in Other income, net due to a partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's then equity method investee HC Group Holdings.
13 Includes significant gains on business combinations due to the remeasurement of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded such pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively.
14 In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred a $4 million loss in connection with the early extinguishment of debt related to the integration of Shields. In fiscal 2021, the Company incurred a $419 million loss related to the Company's cash tender offers to partially purchase and retire $3.3 billion of long-term U.S. denominated notes. The Company excludes these charges as related activities do not reflect the Company’s ongoing financial performance.
15 Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision (benefit) commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and U.K. tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit).
16 Adjustments to post tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. In fiscal 2021, due to partial sales of ownership interests in Option Care Health, our then equity method investee HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $1.2 billion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings of $576 million.

The Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of co-located VillageMD clinics and number of total VillageMD clinics, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year.

The Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk factors.

The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, continuing obligations for recently announced or completed acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements, debt offerings, sale of marketable securities and current cash and investment balances. On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit agreement and an eighteen-month $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement. Simultaneously, with the entry into the credit agreements, the Company has terminated the Revolving Credit Agreements dated December 23, 2020 and August 29, 2018. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had an aggregate borrowing capacity under committed revolving credit facilities of $5.0 billion, with no funds drawn under these facilities. On June 3, 2022, a notice of redemption was given to holders of certain notes issued by the Company on September 13, 2012. As a result, on July 5, 2022, the notes with aggregate principal amount of $731 million were redeemed in full. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. See Part II, Item 7A, Qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk, for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash were $2.6 billion (including $188 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2022, compared to $1.3 billion (including $204 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2021. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.

On May 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. The settlement amount of $683 million million includes $620 million to be paid in equal installments to the State of Florida over 18 years, and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys’ fees. The Company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on June 17, 2022.

On August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of its equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Company Limited for approximately $150 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

On September 20, 2022, the Company announced the acceleration of its plans for full ownership of Shields. The Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 30% equity interest for approximately $1.37 billion of cash consideration. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 11, 2022, the Company announced the acceleration of its plans for full ownership of CareCentrix. The Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 45% equity interest for approximately $392 million of cash consideration. The acquisition is subject to limited customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 2023. See Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.

At August 31, 2022, the Company had no guarantees outstanding and the letters of credit issued were not material.

See Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information on the Company’s debt instruments and its recent financing actions.

Cash flows from operating activities
Cash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, reflects lower cash inflows from inventories, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher cash inflows from accounts receivable.

Changes in inventory, accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by timing, absence of COVID-19 related government support, and payments for certain legal and regulatory settlements. Changes in accounts payable are mainly driven by impact of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline and timing of payments. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by lower COVID-19 volume and timing of collections.

Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities was $(1.1) billion, $4.1 billion and $(1.3) billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2022 includes cash outflows associated with business, investment and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired of VillageMD, Shields and CareCentrix for $0.8 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, offset by $900 million of sale proceeds related to the Company's sale of the 6.0 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock and $363 million related to the Company's sale of 11.0 million shares of Option Care Health common stock and proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $1.3 billion. See Note 6. Equity method investments and Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

Financing activities in fiscal 2021 includes the partial purchase and retirement of $3.3 billion of long-term debt. See Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

The Company acquired $2.1 billion of non-controlling interests in fiscal 2022. See Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $187 million, $110 million and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.

Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.

Stock repurchase program
In June 2018, the Company's Board of Director's approved a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2022. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans.

The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.

Debt covenants
Each of the Company’s credit facilities described in Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, legal contingencies and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:

Business combinations – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.

The lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.

The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.

Finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment – Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability.

The Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

Impairment of long lived assets – The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.

The determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.

Cost of sales and inventory –

Retail, Pharmacy and Wholesale
Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. Cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.

The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, distribution of products, and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company’s International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) method.

Table of Contents

Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors’ products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors’ products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of Selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the Company.

Healthcare services
For operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization. Medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients. Cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits. Clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.

Equity method investments – The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.

The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

Pension and post-retirement benefits – The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.

In determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $213 million to the Company’s pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $16 million.

The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.

Contingencies – The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.

Income taxes –The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the U.S. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million.

['s estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.

The lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.

The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.

Finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.

Table of Contents
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment – Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability.

The Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

Impairment of long lived assets – The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.

The determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.

Cost of sales and inventory –

Retail, Pharmacy and Wholesale
Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. Cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.

The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, distribution of products, and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company’s International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) method.

------------------------- --
WBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 57

Table of Contents

Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors’ products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors’ products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of Selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the Company.

Healthcare services
For operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization. Medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients. Cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits. Clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.

Equity method investments – The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.

The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

Pension and post-retirement benefits – The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.

In determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $213 million to the Company’s pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $16 million.

The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.

Contingencies – The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.

Income taxes –The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the U.S. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, legal contingencies and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:

Business combinations – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company']:
Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 74 ----------------- ------------- Alphabet Inc.
