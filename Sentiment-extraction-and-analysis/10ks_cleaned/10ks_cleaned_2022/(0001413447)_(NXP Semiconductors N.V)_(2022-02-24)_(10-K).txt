Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as permitted by the new rules.

In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842) Lessors—Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments. ASU 2021-05 continues to address any additional issues that may have arisen since the adoption of Topic 842 by public business entities. The amendments in this Update affect lessors with lease contracts that (1) have variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and (2) would have resulted in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement if classified as sales-type or direct financing. ASU 2021-05 became effective for us on December 15, 2021. We have assessed our current positions and the interrelation to the amendments and the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

No other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Combination and Asset Acquisition [Abstract]
Acquisitions and Divestments
Tangible fixed assets 2
Inventory 50
Identified intangible assets 514
Goodwill 1,138
Deferred tax assets 1
Net assets acquired 1,705

Our valuation procedures related to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities was completed during the second quarter of 2020.

Goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the anticipated growth from new product sales, sales to new customers, the assembled workforce and synergies expected from the combination. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The identified intangible assets assumed were recognized as follows:

Fair Value Weighted Average Estimated Useful Life (in Years)
----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ---
Customer relationships (included in customer-related) 20 6
Developed technology (included in technology-based) 324 4.4
In-process research and development (1) 170 N/A
Total identified intangible assets 514

1)Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is an intangible asset classified as an indefinite lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort. IPR&D will be amortized over an estimated useful life to be determined at the date the associated research and development effort is completed, or expensed immediately when, and if, the project is abandoned. Acquired IPR&D is not amortized during the period that it is considered indefinite lived, but rather is subject to annual testing for impairment or when there are indicators for impairment.

Variations of the income approach were applied to estimate the fair values of the intangible assets acquired. Developed technology and IPR&D were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method which reflects the present values of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing technology and IPR&D less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Customer relationships were valued using the distributor method which uses market-based data to support the selection of profitability related to the customer relationship function.

Acquisition-related transaction costs ($5 million) such as legal, accounting and other related expenses were recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Pro forma financial information (unaudited)

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents combined consolidated results of operations for each of the fiscal years presented, as if Marvell’s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets had been acquired as of January 1, 2018:

 2019 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------- ----- -----
Revenue 9,169 9,715
Net income (loss) attributable to stockholders 237 2,154
Net income (loss) per common share attributable to stockholders:
–Basic 0.84 6.61
–Diluted 0.83 6.55

The pro forma information include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimate changes in amortization and depreciation for identified intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired and adjustments to share-based compensation expense. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the revenue or operating results that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually taken place as of January 1, 2018 or of the results of future operations of the combined business. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved from the combined operations. On March 27, 2019, we sold our remaining equity interest in WeEn, receiving net cash proceeds of $37 million.

.

We recorded an income tax expense of $272 million in 2021, which reflects an effective tax rate of 12.5% compared to a benefit of $83 million and an effective rate of (8300.0)% in 2020.The effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, sale of non-deductible goodwill and withholding taxes. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:

•The Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. For 2021, the foreign tax and Netherlands tax incentives were higher than 2020 by $67 million, mainly due to the fact that NXP increased its investment expenditures and benefited from higher qualifying income.
•The increase in the valuation allowance is mostly due to new Dutch corporate income tax law applicable as from 2019. A portion of the interest expenses is non-deductible in the year it is recorded but can be carried forward without expiration. The release of the valuation allowance in 2021 is due to higher qualifying income compared to 2020 and 2019.
•The withholding tax benefit in 2021 is mainly due to changes in considering more undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested resulting in a tax benefit of $17 million.The difference of $36 million in the withholding tax benefit in 2020 as compared with the tax expense in 2019 is mainly due to changes in the applicable deferred tax liability rate regarding future remittances of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and due to changes in considering more undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested.
•The tax effect of the non-deductible goodwill of $10 million is linked to the divestiture of the VAS business in 2020.

The Company benefits from income tax holidays in certain jurisdictions which provide that we pay reduced income taxes in those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction. The predominant income tax holiday is expected to expire at the end of 2026. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign income taxes by $14 million in 2021 (2020: $11 million; 2019: $12 million). The benefit of this tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $0.05 in 2021 (2020: $0.04; 2019: $0.04).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
The principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:

Goodwill (83) (66)
Other current and non-current assets (63) (56)
Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (211) (307)
Net Deferred Tax Position 384 392

The classification of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:

 2021 2020
------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----
Deferred tax assets within other non-current assets 441 477
Deferred tax liabilities within non-current liabilities (57) (85)
 384 392

The Company has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income or income taxes payable in future periods. Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a “more likely than not” threshold. The realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance decreased by $66 million during 2021 (2020: $37 million increase). Besides the net change in the valuation allowance of $20 million this mainly includes a decrease of the valuation allowance due to liquidating a dormant legal entity for $17 million and for the remainder due to a change in estimates of prior years' income taxes.

We consider all available evidence in forming a judgment regarding the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, including events that occur subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. The deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that we consider it more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversal of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.
At December 31, 2021 tax loss carryforwards of $537 million (inclusive of $139 million of U.S. state tax losses) will expire as follows:

Balance Scheduled expiration

Tax loss carryforwards 537 13 2 3 10 13 91 45 360

This overview is excluding carried forward tax incentives of $78 million which have an unlimited expiration date.

The Company also has tax credit carryforwards of $363 million (excluding the effect of unrecognized tax benefits), which are available to offset future tax, if any, and which will expire as follows:

Tax credit carryforwards 363 10 11 11 19 22 49 188 53

The net income tax payable (excluding the liability for unrecognized tax benefits) as of December 31, 2021 amounted to $55 million (2020: net income tax payable of $117 million) and includes amounts directly receivable from or payable to tax authorities.

The Company does not indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries. Consequently, the Company has recognized a deferred tax liability of $38 million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $54 million) for the additional income taxes and withholding taxes payable upon the future remittances of these earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company considers $345 million of the undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested although the timing of the reversal can be controlled. Upon repatriation of those earnings the Company would be subject to tax of $35 million, which is not recognized as deferred tax liability at December 31, 2021.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows:

 2021 2020 2019
---------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---
Balance as of January 1, 161 159 165
Translation differences (1) — (1)
Lapse of statute of limitations (1) (4) (3)
Increases from tax positions taken during prior periods 7 5 4
Decreases from tax positions taken during prior periods (1) — (4)
Increases from tax positions taken during current period 11 7 7
Decreases relating to settlements with the tax authorities — (6) (9)
Balance as of December 31, 176 161 159

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, $152 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. All other unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate as these would be offset by compensating adjustments in the Company’s deferred tax assets that would be subject to valuation allowance based on conditions existing at the reporting date.

The Company classifies interest related to an underpayment of income taxes as financial expense and penalties as income tax expense. The total related interest and penalties recorded during the year 2021 amounted to a $5 million expense (2020: $4 million expense; 2019: $3 million benefit). As of December 31, 2021 the Company has recognized a liability for related interest and penalties of $18 million (2020: $13 million; 2019: $11 million). It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase/decrease within the next 12 months of the reporting date due to, for example, completion of tax examinations.

NXP’s contribution to the plan exceeded more than 5 percent of the total contribution (as of December 31 of the plan’s year end) No No No

The amount for pension costs included in the statement of operations for the year 2021 was $112 million (2020: $103 million; 2019: $98 million) of which $52 million (2020: $47 million; 2019: $47 million) represents defined-contribution plans and $32 million (2020: $29 million; 2019: $27 million) represents the PME multi-employer plans.

Defined-benefit plans
The benefits provided by defined-benefit plans are based on employees’ years of service and compensation levels. Contributions are made by the Company, as necessary, to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits payable to defined-benefit pension plan participants.

These contributions are determined based upon various factors, including funded status, legal and tax considerations as well as local customs. The Company funds certain defined-benefit pension plans as claims are incurred.

The total ongoing cost of defined-benefit plans amounted to $28 million in 2021 (2020: a cost of $27 million; 2019: a cost of $24 million).
The table below provides a summary of the changes in the pension benefit obligations and defined-benefit pension plan assets for 2021 and 2020, associated with the Company’s dedicated plans, and a reconciliation of the funded status of these plans to the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Exchange rate differences (18) 16
Fair value of plan assets at end of year 222 224
Funded status (508) (566)
Classification of the funded status is as follows
– Accrued pension cost within other non-current liabilities (497) (554)
– Accrued pension cost within accrued liabilities (11) (12)
Total (508) (566)
Accumulated benefit obligation
Accumulated benefit obligation for all Company-dedicated benefit pension plans 705 755
Plans with assets less than accumulated benefit obligation (including unfunded plans)
– Fair value of plan assets 217 220
– Accumulated benefit obligations 699 750
Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (before tax)
Total AOCI at beginning of year 214 140
– Net actuarial loss (gain) (24) 58
– Exchange rate differences (15) 16
Total AOCI at end of year 175 214

The net amount of projected benefit obligation and plan assets for all underfunded (including unfunded) pension plans was $508 million and $566 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was classified as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, actuarial losses were primarily related to increases in discount rates of approximately 40 basis points on a weighted basis and updates to mortality table benchmarks in various countries. For the year ended December 31, 2020, actuarial losses were primarily related to decreases in discount rates of approximately 40 basis points on a weighted basis and updates to mortality table benchmarks in various countries.
The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations were as follows:

 2021 2020
----------------------------- ---- - --- -
Discount rate 1.2 % 0.8 %
Rate of compensation increase 2.2 % 1.6 %

The weighted average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension cost were as follows:

 2021 2020 2019
------------------------------- ---- ---- --- - --- -
Discount rate 0.8 % 1.2 % 2.0 %
Expected returns on plan assets 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.7 %
Rate of compensation increase 1.6 % 1.5 % 1.8 %

For the Company’s major plans, the discount rate used is based on high quality corporate bonds (iBoxx Corporate Euro AA 10+).

Plans in certain Asian countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local sovereign rate and the plans' maturities (Bloomberg Government Bond Yields).

Expected returns per asset class are based on the assumption that asset valuations tend to return to their respective long-term equilibria. The Expected Return on Assets for any funded plan equals the average of the expected returns per asset class weighted by their portfolio weights in accordance with the fund’s strategic asset allocation.

The components of net periodic pension costs were as follows:

 2021 2020 2019
------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---
Service cost 18 17 14
Interest cost on the projected benefit obligation 6 7 12
Expected return on plan assets (6) (5) (6)
Amortization of net (gain) loss 10 8 4
Curtailments & settlements — — —
Net periodic cost 28 27 24

The components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in Other financial income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Plan assets
The actual pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:

 2021 2020
------------------- ---- --- -- -
Asset category:
Equity securities 34 % 34 %
Debt securities 35 % 39 %
Insurance contracts 7 % 7 %
Other 24 % 20 %
 100 % 100 %

We met our target plan asset allocation. The investment objectives for the pension plan assets are designed to generate returns that, along with the future contributions, will enable the pension plans to meet their future obligations. The investments in our major defined benefit plans largely consist of government bonds, “Level 2” Corporate Bonds and cash to mitigate the risk of interest fluctuations. The asset mix of equity, bonds, cash and other categories is evaluated by an asset-liability modeling study for our largest plan. The assets of funded plans in other countries mostly have a large proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are
aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Total pension plan assets of $222 million include $193 million related to the German and Japanese pension funds.

The following table summarizes the classification of these assets.

 2021 2020
------------------- -------- --------- ------- -------- --------- --
Level I Level II Level III Level I Level II Level III
Equity securities — 71 — — 71 —
Debt securities 6 53 — 8 62 —
Insurance contracts — 15 — — 15 —
Other 1 24 22 — 21 18
 7 163 22 8 169 18

The Company currently expects to make $12 million of employer contributions to defined-benefit pension plans and $10 million of expected cash payments in relation to unfunded pension plans in 2022.

Estimated future pension benefit payments
The following benefit payments are expected to be made (including those for funded plans):

 2022 22
--------------- ---
 2023 23
 2024 25
 2025 25
 2026 28
Years 2027-2031 162

Postretirement health care benefits
In addition to providing pension benefits, NXP provides retiree healthcare benefits in the US which are accounted for as defined-benefit plans.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the end of 2021 equals $4 million (2020: $6 million).

2021 Financing Activities

2032, 2042 and 2051 Senior Unsecured Notes
On November 30, 2021, NXP B.V., together with NXP USA Inc. and NXP Funding LLC, issued $1 billion of 2.65% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032, $500 million of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2042 and $500 million of 3.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2051. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of these notes to redeem the $1 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding 3.875% Senior Notes due 2022. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures or equity buyback transactions.

2031 and 2041 Senior Unsecured Notes
On May 11, 2021, NXP B.V., together with NXP USA Inc. and NXP Funding LLC, issued $1 billion of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 and $1 billion of 3.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2041. The net proceeds of the 2.5% Senior Notes due 2031 ("2031 Notes") are being used to finance certain eligible green projects. Pending the allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds of the 2031 Notes to finance these eligible green projects, the remaining net proceeds of the 2031 Notes, together with the net proceeds of the 3.25% Senior Notes due 2041, are temporarily being held as cash and other short-term securities or are being used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, short-term debt repayment or equity buyback transactions.

Certain terms and Covenants of the notes

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.
The indentures governing the notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and that of restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted subsidiaries; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; and effect a consolidation or merger. The Company has been in compliance with any such indentures and financing covenants.
No portion of long-term and short-term debt as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 has been secured by collateral on substantially all of the Company’s assets and of certain of its subsidiaries.
We are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2021.
2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes

In November 2014, NXP issued $1,150 million principal amount of its 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”). The Cash Convertible Notes matured on December 1, 2019. All of the holders elected to convert their Cash Convertible Notes for settlement on December 2, 2019, and none of the Cash Convertible Notes were repurchased or converted into cash prior to such date.

On December 2, 2019, we repaid the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of the Cash Convertible Notes using available cash. In separate transactions, NXP also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to 11.18 million shares of NXP’s common stock at an initial strike price of $133.32 per share in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The warrants expired on various dates ranging from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020. During the full period the NXP share price was below the conversion price of the warrants, and as such, none of the warrants have been converted. The Warrants are included in diluted earnings per share to the extent the impact is dilutive. As of December 31, 2020, the Warrants were not dilutive.

Commitments and Contingencies Disclosure [Abstract]
Commitments and Contingencies Commitments and ContingenciesPurchase Commitments The Company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers, primarily for raw materials, semi-finished goods and manufacturing services and for some non-production items. Purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary for different suppliers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase commitments of $4,354 million, which are due through 2044. Our long-term obligations increased substantially in 2021 as we locked in long-term supply with our key manufacturing partners. Litigation We are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation relating to a variety of matters such as contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employee grievances and intellectual property litigation. In addition, our acquisitions, divestments and financial transactions sometimes result in, or are followed by, claims or litigation. Some of these claims may possibly be recovered from insurance reimbursements. Although the ultimate disposition of asserted claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is our belief that the outcome of any such claims, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, such outcomes may be material to our consolidated statement of operations for a particular period. The Company records an accrual for any claim that arises whenever it considers that it is probable that it is exposed to a loss contingency and the amount of the loss contingency can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees are expensed when incurred. Based on the most current information available to it and based on its best estimate, the Company also reevaluates at least on a quarterly basis the claims that have arisen to determine whether any new accruals need to be made or whether any accruals made need to be adjusted. Based on the procedures described above, the Company has an aggregate amount of $65 million accrued for potential and current legal proceedings pending as of December 31, 2021, compared to $17 million accrued at December 31, 2020 (without reduction for any related insurance reimbursements). The accruals are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other non-current liabilities”. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s balance related to insurance reimbursements was $46 million (December 31, 2020: $8 million) and is included in “Other non-current assets”. The Company also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued based on currently available information for those cases for which such estimate can be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. As at December 31, 2021, the Company believes that for all litigation pending its potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued (without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under insurance programs) could range between $0 million and $63 million. Based upon our past experience with these matters, the Company would expect to receive additional insurance reimbursement of up to $48 million on certain of these claims that would partially offset the potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued. In addition, the Company is currently assisting Motorola in the defense of personal injury lawsuits due to indemnity obligations included in the agreement that separated Freescale from Motorola in 2004. The multi-plaintiff Motorola lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These claims allege a link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room facilities and birth defects in 18 individuals. The Motorola suits allege exposures between 1981 and 2006. Each claim seeks an unspecified amount of damages for the alleged injuries; however, legal counsel representing the plaintiffs have indicated they will seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages from Motorola for the entire inventory of claims which, if proven and recovered, the Company considers to be material. A portion of any indemnity due to Motorola will be reimbursed to NXP if Motorola receives an indemnification payment from its insurance coverage. Motorola has potential insurance coverage for many of the years indicated above, but with differing types and levels of coverage, self-insurance retention amounts and deductibles. We are in discussions with Motorola and their insurers regarding the availability of applicable insurance coverage for each of the individual cases. Motorola and NXP have denied liability for these alleged injuries based on numerous defenses. Loss recoveryIn February 2021, NXP’s two wafer manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas were negatively impacted by unusually severe winter weather conditions that corresponded with a widespread disruption of gas, electricity, and water. The Company has insurance coverage for the repair or replacement of assets that suffered damage or loss and business interruption coverage, including lost profits, and the reimbursement of other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered.For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $177 million in insurance proceeds directly offsetting the loss from operations that were incurred in the period.Environmental remediation In each jurisdiction in which we operate, we are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. As with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities. Certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Soil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our properties in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and near Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The remediation processes at these locations are expected to continue for many years. As of December 31, 2021, we have recorded $87 million for environmental remediation costs, which are primarily included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount represents the undiscounted future cash flows of our estimated share of costs incurred in environmental cleanup sites without considering recovery of costs from any other party or insurer, since in most cases potentially responsible parties other than us may exist and be held responsible.

Share-based awards
The Company has granted share-based awards to the members of our board of directors, management team, our other executives, selected other key employees/talents of NXP and selected new hires to receive the Company’s shares in the future. See Note 17, “Share-based Compensation”.

Treasury shares
From time to time, last on May 26, 2021, the General Meeting of Shareholders authorizes the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our common stock. On that basis, the Board of Directors has approved various share repurchase programs. In accordance with the Company’s policy to provide share-based awards from its treasury share inventory, shares which have been repurchased and are held in treasury for delivery upon exercise of options and under restricted and performance share programs, are accounted for as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity. Treasury shares are recorded at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date. When issued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

Differences between the cost and the proceeds received when treasury shares are reissued, are recorded in capital in excess of par value. Deficiencies in excess of net gains arising from previous treasury share issuances are charged to retained earnings.

The following transactions took place resulting from employee option and share plans:

Shareholder tax on repurchased shares
Under Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company’s shares by an entity in the Netherlands is a taxable event (unless exemptions apply). The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders’ behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders’ equity.
The computation of earnings per share (EPS) is presented in the following table:

 2021 2020 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------- -------
Net income (loss) 1,906 80 272
Less: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests 35 28 29

EPS attributable to stockholders in $:
Basic net income (loss) 6.91 0.19 0.86
Diluted net income (loss) 6.79 0.18 0.85

1)No stock options to purchase shares of NXP’s common stock that were outstanding in 2021 (2020: none; 2019: 0.1 million shares) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common stock or the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense and exercise prices was greater than the weighted average number of shares underlying outstanding stock options. 2)Unvested RSU’s, PSU’s and equity rights up to 0.1 million shares that were outstanding in 2021 (2020: 0.6 shares; 2019: 0.7 million shares) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense was greater than the weighted average number of outstanding unvested RSU’s, PSU’s and equity rights or the performance goal has not been met.

Share-based Compensation 12 Months Ended

Share-based Payment Arrangement [Abstract]
Share-based Compensation
 2021 2020 2019
Cost of revenue 45 45 42
Research and development 165 159 141
Selling, general and administrative 143 180 163

The income tax (expense) benefit recognized in net income related to share-based compensation expenses was $54 million (includes $32 million of excess tax benefits), $32 million (includes $10 million of excess tax benefits) and $27 million (includes $3 million of excess tax benefits) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP’s)
The LTIP was introduced in 2010 and is a broad-based long-term retention program to attract, retain and motivate talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee interests. The LTIP provides share-based compensation (“awards”) to both our eligible employees and non-employee directors. Awards that may be granted include performance shares, stock options and restricted shares. On November 2, 2021, the Company granted PSU awards to certain executives of the Company with a performance measure of Relative Total Shareholder Return (“Relative TSR”). Each PSU, which cliff vests on the third anniversary of the date of grant, entitles the grant recipient to receive from 0 to 2 common shares for each of the target units awarded based on
the Relative TSR of the Company's share price as compared to a set of peer companies. The Company estimates the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model, utilizing assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes methodology. The grant date fair value was $257.26 per PSU. The fair value of the PSUs is recognized as compensation cost over the service period of 3 years. Awards granted generally will become fully vested upon a termination event occurring within one year following a change in control, as defined. A termination event is defined as either termination of employment or services other than for cause or constructive termination resulting from a significant reduction in either the nature or scope of duties and responsibilities, a reduction in compensation or a required relocation. The number of shares authorized and available for awards at December 31, 2021 was 23.8 million.

A charge of $331 million was recorded in 2021 for the LTIP (2020: $376 million; 2019: $339 million).

A summary of the activity for our LTIP’s during 2021 is presented below.

Stock options
The options have a strike price equal to the closing share price on the grant date. The fair value of the options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, using the following assumptions:
•an expected life varying from 5.98 to 6.25 years, calculated in accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff bulletin No. 110 for plain vanilla options using the simplified method, since our equity shares have been publicly traded for only a limited period of time and we did not have sufficient historical exercise data at the grant date of the options;
•a risk-free interest rate varying from 1.2% to 1.9% (2020: 1.2% to 1.9%; 2019: 1.0% to 1.9%);
•no expected dividend payments; and
•a volatility of 42 – 45% based on the volatility of a set of peer companies. Peer company data was used given the short period of time our shares had been publicly traded.

Above assumptions were valid at the moment NXP granted the options. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.

Fair Value Disclosures [Abstract]
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Estimated fair value
Fair valuehierarchy December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020
Assets:
Money market funds 1 2,111 1,469
Marketable equity securities 1 18 19
Derivative instruments-assets 2 5 18
Liabilities:
Derivative instruments-liabilities 2 (3) —

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
Investments in money market funds (as part of our cash and cash equivalents) and marketable equity securities (as part of other non-current assets) have fair value measurements which are all based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For derivatives (as part of other current assets or accrued liabilities) the fair value is based upon significant other observable inputs depending on the nature of the derivative.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis
We measure and record our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, at fair value when an impairment charge is required.

Assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period and debt.As of December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of current and non-current debt was $11.3 billion ($8.6 billion as of December 31, 2020). The fair value is estimated on the basis of broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. Accrued interest is included under accrued liabilities and not within the carrying amount or estimated fair value of debt.
