Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, in the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $10.6 billion, our access to debt and equity capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. Our primary sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. Our material cash requirements include operating expenses, potential dividend payments and share repurchases, scheduled debt maturities (the next of which is in 2026), capital expenditures and other commitments, as discussed below.

As of December 31, 2021, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $3.9 billion, as compared to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. These cash balances are generally available for use in the U.S., subject in some cases to certain restrictions.

Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, and other structural changes, with certain of the foregoing actions, if we were to move forward with them, requiring Microsoft's approval under the Merger Agreement (which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), subject to certain exceptions. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the income generated from the sale of our products and services. This is partially offset by: working capital requirements used in the development, sale, and support of our products; payments for interest on our debt; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $2.4 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and lower tax payments in the current year, as the prior-year period included payments for a tax settlement in France with no comparable activity in 2021, partially offset by changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $59 million, as compared to $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from the sale and maturities of available-for-sale investments of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $521 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $711 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to:

•net debt proceeds of $896 million received for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of new notes and the early redemption of $1.05 billion of our previously outstanding notes, with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2021;

•higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units, driven by a higher volume of share releases, at higher market values, resulting in $246 million of payments during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $39 million during the year ended December 31, 2020; and

•lower proceeds on issuance of stock to employees, with $90 million received during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $170 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $48 million and a positive impact of $69 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Debt

At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our total gross unsecured senior notes outstanding was $3.7 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.87%.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

At each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as “structured finance” or “special purpose” entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and “match three.” We primarily offer the following products and services:

•premium full games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;

•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;

•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e., microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our premium full-game and free-to-play offerings; and

•subscriptions to players in World of Warcraft, which provide ongoing access to the game content.

When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.

We determine revenue recognition by:

•identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

•identifying the performance obligations in each contract;

•determining the transaction price;

•allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and

•recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.

Certain products are sold to customers with a “street date” (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.

Table of Contents
Product Sales

Product sales consist of sales of our games, including digital full-game downloads and physical products. We recognize revenues from the sale of our products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied. Such revenues, which include our software products with significant online functionality and our online hosted software arrangements, are recognized in "Product sales" on our consolidated statement of operations.

Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular advertisement, are recorded as “Sales and marketing” expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service.

Products with Online Functionality

For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online functionality, such as most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality each represent separate and distinct performance obligations. In such instances, we typically have two performance obligations: (1) a license to the game software that is accessible without an Internet connection (predominantly the offline single player campaign or game mode) and (2) ongoing activities associated with the online components of the game, such as content updates, hosting of online content and gameplay, and online matchmaking (the “online functionality”). The online functionality generally operates to support the additional features and functionalities of the game that are only available online, not the offline license. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. When we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property (i.e., the offline software license) that is separate and distinct from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the standalone selling price for the performance obligations, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.

For arrangements that include both a license to the game software that is accessible offline and separate online functionality, we recognize revenue when control of the license transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the offline software license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly, we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution costs, software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.

Online Hosted Software Arrangements

For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. In these instances, we typically have a single performance obligation related to our ongoing activities in the hosted arrangement, including content updates, hosting of the gameplay, online matchmaking, and access to the game content. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.

In-game, Subscription, and Other Revenues

In-game Revenues

In-game revenues primarily includes revenue from microtransactions and downloadable content. Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency. Proceeds from the direct sales of virtual goods are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either “consumable” or “durable.” Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the estimated service period.

Subscription Revenues

Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is only playable online and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.

Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as “Product sales,” whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as “In-game, subscription, and other revenues.

Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include revenues from software licensing, licensing of intellectual property other than software, and advertising in our games. These revenues are recognized in "In-game, subscription, and other revenues" on our consolidated statement of operations.

In certain countries we have software licensing arrangements where we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.

Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over time.

60

Table of Contents
Revenues from advertising arise primarily from contractual relationships with advertising networks, agencies, advertising brokers and directly with advertisers to display advertisements in our games. For all advertising arrangements, we are the principal and our performance obligation is to provide the inventory for advertisements to be displayed in our games. Our advertising arrangements are primarily impression-based and we recognize revenue from these in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an advertisement is displayed to users. The pricing and terms for all our advertising arrangements are governed by either a master contract or insertion order. The transaction price in advertising arrangements governed by a master contract is generally based on a revenue share percentage stated in the contract. The transaction price in advertising arrangements governed by an insertion order is generally the product of the number of advertising units delivered (e.g., impressions, videos viewed) and the contractually agreed upon price per advertising unit.

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but may also depend on a significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality.

Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone selling price we generally consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and the replayability design of both the offline and online components of our games. In limited instances, we may also utilize an expected cost approach to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.

Estimated Service Period

We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days between players’ unique purchase or first day played online, and the time at which players become inactive and cease engaging with our content for a period of time. We also consider known online trends such as the cadence of content delivery in our games, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors’ games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires significant management judgment. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are less than 12 months.

Historically, we have not observed significant variability in our estimated service period as the online content for our games has generally been comparable to previously released titles resulting in similar usage patterns. Future usage patterns could change from historical patterns as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, changes in our online content, frequency of content delivery, competitor’s offerings, and other changes that impact player’s engagement that we may not be able to reasonable predict at the time of deriving our estimate. If future usage patterns were to change significantly from historical patterns, in the future our estimated service period could change and materially impact our future consolidated net revenues and operating income.

Principal Agent Considerations

We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store, Sony’s PSN, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether our revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:

•which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and

61

Table of Contents
•which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.

Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft’s Xbox Games Store and Sony’s PSN.

Income Taxes

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the threshold of “more likely than not” that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination is made.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and complex tax laws. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $32 million.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which also created a new minimum tax that applies to certain foreign earnings (“GILTI”). We have elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed products, as well as payments made to independent software developers under development agreements. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Significant management judgments and estimates are applied in assessing when capitalization commences for software development costs and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses.” Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to “Product development” in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to “Product development.”

Commencing upon a product’s release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses” based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Additionally, criteria used to evaluate expected product performance may include, as appropriate: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. Historically, our forecasted and actual product sales have been more than enough to recover capitalized software costs. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management’s expectations.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the income debt; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $2.4 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and lower tax payments in the current year, as the prior-year period included payments for a tax settlement in France with no comparable activity in 2021, partially offset by changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $59 million, as compared to $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from the sale and maturities of available-for-sale investments of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the as the payment of dividends.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $521 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $711 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to:

•net debt proceeds of $896 million received for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from December 31, 2021;

•higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units, driven by a higher volume of share releases, at higher market values, resulting in $246 million of payments during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $39 million during the year ended December 31, 2020; and

•lower proceeds on issuance of stock to employees, with $90 million received during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $170 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $48 million and a positive impact of $69 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Debt

At both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our total gross unsecured senior notes outstanding was $3.7 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.87%.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and “match three.” We primarily offer the following products and services:

•premium full games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;

•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;

•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e., microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our premium full-game and free-to-play offerings; and

•subscriptions to players in World of Warcraft, which provide ongoing access to the game content.

When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.

We determine revenue recognition by:

•identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

•identifying the performance obligations in each contract;

•determining the transaction price;

•allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and

•recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.

Certain products are sold to customers with a “street date” (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we such as sales and value-added taxes.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.
