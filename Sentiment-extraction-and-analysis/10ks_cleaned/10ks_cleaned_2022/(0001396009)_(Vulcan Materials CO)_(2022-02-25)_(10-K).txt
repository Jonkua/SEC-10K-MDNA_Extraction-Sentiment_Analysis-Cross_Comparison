Part II 38

Our teams finished the year strong, despite ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures and labor constraints. We expanded our industry-leading unit profitability by continuing to focus on our operating disciplines and taking pricing actions where necessary to mitigate these headwinds. We continue to make excellent progress integrating the U.S. Concrete operations into our business. This acquisition extends our growth platform in certain existing markets as well as new geographies. These results demonstrate our ability to execute on Vulcan’s four strategic disciplines — Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing, Commercial Excellence and Logistics Innovation (as outlined in Item 1 “Business” under the “Business Strategy” heading) — and enhance our operating leverage moving forward. We are well positioned to capitalize on the positive demand trends we see developing in 2022 and beyond.
As demand and the pricing environment continue to strengthen, we expect healthy growth in unit profitability again in 2022. Robust growth in aggregates pricing and continued focus on operational excellence will more than offset anticipated inflationary pressures. In our asphalt business, we expect recent pricing efforts to begin to mitigate higher liquid asphalt costs and lead to gross profit margin improvement beginning in the second half of 2022. In our concrete business, improvement in private nonresidential construction activity will help drive earnings growth in 2022.
At year end 2021, total debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x (2.5x on a net debt basis). We remain committed to our stated long-term target leverage range of 2.0x to 2.5x total debt to Adjusted EBITDA.
Return on invested capital was 14.2% and we remain committed to driving further improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.
CAPITAL ALLOCATION
Our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. Through economic cycles we intend to balance reinvestment in our business, growth through acquisitions, and return of capital to shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility evidenced by our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our capital allocation priorities are as follows:
1.Operating Capital (maintain and grow the value of our franchise)
2.Growth Capital (including greenfields and acquisitions)
3.Dividend Growth (with a keen focus on sustainability)
4.Return Excess Cash to Shareholders (primarily via share repurchases)
Our first priority is to maintain and protect our valuable franchise by keeping our operations in good working order to ensure the production of high quality materials and timely delivery of goods and services to our customers. This capital requirement expands and contracts as production and shipment levels change. During 2021, we invested $281.7 million to replace or improve existing property, plant & equipment.
Our second priority is to grow our franchise through internal growth projects and business acquisitions. Internal growth projects have generally been among our highest returning projects. During 2021, we invested $169.6 million in internal growth projects to secure new aggregates reserves, develop new production and/or distribution sites, enhance our distribution capabilities and support the targeted growth of our asphalt and concrete operations. For business acquisitions, we tend to look for bolt-on acquisitions which are easy to integrate and will pursue large business combinations that are the right fit and the right price. During August 2021, we closed on one such large business combination (U.S. Concrete) for $1,634.5 million. We use strategic and returns-based criteria to price potential acquisitions and are disciplined in our approach. We look at a lot of potential acquisitions and only make offers on a few. We closed two business acquisitions (including U.S. Concrete) during 2021 for total consideration of $1,639.4 million.
Our third priority is growing the dividend with a keen focus on sustainability through the economic cycle. During 2021, we paid a dividend per share of $1.48 and paid total dividends of $196.4 million.
And finally, if there is excess cash after fulfilling the prior capital allocation priorities, we will consider returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases. During 2021, we made no share repurchases.
For a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Part II 39

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
We carry considerable momentum into the new year. Our markets are poised to outperform other parts of the country as demand continues to improve and our industry-leading unit profitability increases with each passing quarter. We will continue to drive substantial value through the combination of our legacy business and the acquisition of U.S. Concrete. Residential construction remains strong, and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings are growing again. On the public side, infrastructure investment is moving forward, and we are well positioned in attractive growth markets where the need is greatest. The recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is certainly a positive for our industry; it will add to existing demand as well as elongate the cycle. However, we do not expect it to have a significant impact in 2022. That said, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are expected to continue to limit shipment growth in 2022. We expect the favorable pricing dynamics that improved throughout 2021 to be even better in 2022 and lead to attractive growth in aggregates unit profitability. Growing our aggregates unit profitability consistently during the last two years of pandemic-related disruptions demonstrates the resiliency of our business and our ability to capitalize on any changes in the macro environment.
Management expectations for 2022 include:
Net earnings attributable to Vulcan of between $800 to $890 million
Adjusted EBITDA of between $1,720 to $1,820 million
High single-digit growth in Aggregates cash gross profit per ton ($7.43 in 2021)
Total shipment growth of 5% to 7% (222.9 million tons in 2021)
Freight-adjusted price increase of 6% to 8% ($14.87 per ton in 2021)
Mid-single digit increase in freight-adjusted cash cost (freight-adjusted sales price less segment cash gross profit per ton; $7.44 per ton in 2021) due to higher energy-related costs (mostly diesel fuel) and continued inflationary pressures in other areas
Cash gross profit of $300 to $325 million in Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium, collectively
Concrete segment expected to account for approximately 75% of the total due to a full year of results from U.S. Concrete operations as well as margin improvement in our legacy operations
Asphalt segment earnings improvement driven by volume growth and price improvement. Higher prices for asphalt mix in the second half of 2022 are expected to reduce the earnings impact of higher liquid asphalt costs and natural gas used in production
SAG expenses of $485 to $495 million, including a full year of U.S. Concrete
Interest expense of approximately $150 million
Depreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of approximately $540 million
An effective tax rate of 21% to 22%
As previously noted, 2022 sales volumes may be affected by labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. If these constraints do continue well into 2022, it is important to remember that the work is still there; it may just proceed at a slower pace, effectively extending the recovery and allowing us the opportunity to compound our unit margins.
Additionally, we expect to spend $600 million to $650 million on capital expenditures, including growth and capacity-adding projects. We will continue to review our plans and will adjust as needed, while being thoughtful about preserving liquidity.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
AGGREGATES FOOTPRINT
Over time, we have strategically and systematically built one of the most valuable aggregates franchises in the U.S. with a footprint that is impossible to replicate. Zoning and permitting regulations have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. Such regulations, while curtailing expansion, also increase the value of our reserves that were zoned and permitted decades ago.
Demand for aggregates correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have a coast-to-coast footprint that serves 20 of the top 25 highest-growth metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and states where 75% of U.S. population growth from 2020 to 2030 is projected to occur. As state and federal spending increases, Vulcan is poised to benefit greatly from growing private and public demand for aggregates, thereby delivering significant long-term value for our shareholders.

Part II 41

COMPOUNDING IMPROVEMENT IN PROFITABILITY
We have continued to deliver strong financial performance over time and through business cycles. Through our aggregates-led strategy and focus on our four strategic disciplines — operational excellence, strategic sourcing, commercial excellence and logistics innovation (as outlined in Item 1 “Business” under the “Business Strategy” heading) — we have created one of the most profitable public companies in our industry as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton.

We are currently operating considerably below full capacity making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale as markets continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
A strategy for sustainable, long-term value creation must include doing right by your employees, your neighbors and the environment in which you operate. Over our more than six decades as a public company, we have built a strong, resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way.
We are a leader in our industry in safety, health and environmental performance, with a safety record substantially better than the industry average. We apply the shared experiences, expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites, with an emphasis on taking care of one another. The result is a record of safety excellence that consistently outperforms the industry.

Part II 42

We focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives resulting in 98.6% citation-free inspections out of all 2021 federal and state environmental inspections. As an industry leader, our aim has always been to meet — and strive to exceed — all federal, state and local environmental regulations. However, environmental sustainability means looking beyond what is required of a company by governments and regulators. We continue to make progress on reducing our carbon footprint, increasing our energy efficiency, measuring and reducing our water use, and managing our land with biodiversity in mind. It’s the right thing to do for society, for our business and our stakeholders.
Our environmental stewardship commitment is designed to protect plant and animal species and habitats, as well as the air we breathe, the water we use and the planet we all share. Our environmental stewardship is reflected in our business strategy. In all parts of our company, from local operations to our corporate and regional offices to our international business and ocean-going shipping, we are focused on ensuring that our operations are efficient in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable.
We lead community relations programs that serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate. During 2021, we operated 40 certified wildlife habitat sites, the third largest number of sites in the nation, as certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council. We provided over 175 scholarships to students nationwide and emphasized COVID-19 support as well as diversity and inclusion in our community outreach and contributions.
We recognize that the aggregates mining in which we engage is an interim use of the more than 240,000 acres of land in our portfolio. Our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses at the end of mining. Effective management throughout the life cycle of our land — from pre-mining utilization as agriculture and timber development, to post-mining development as water reservoirs or residential and commercial development — not only generates significant additional value for our shareholders but greatly benefits the communities in which we operate.
STRONG FINANCIAL FOUNDATION
Our financial position is strong as evidenced by our investment-grade credit ratings (Fitch BBB/Moody’s Baa2/Standard & Poor’s BBB+). At December 31, 2021, our available liquidity was $1,175.4 million, including $241.5 million of cash on hand, significantly higher than our liquidity needs. Our leverage ratio, as measured by total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, has improved from 6.5x at December 31, 2012 to 2.7x at December 31, 2021 (our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at December 31, 2021 was 2.5x), nearly within our stated leverage target of 2.0 to 2.5x. Over that same period, we also improved the structure of our debt (average maturity from 7 years to 11 years) and reduced the cost of the debt (weighted average interest rate from 7.55% to 3.68%).

Part II 43

CUSTOMER SERVICE
More than an aggregates supplier, we are a business dedicated to customer service and finding creative solutions to meet our customers’ needs. Being a valued partner and trusted supplier means that we are providing the right product, with the right specifications, that is the right quality, delivered the right way — on time and safely. Our One-Vulcan, Locally Led approach, in which our employees work together to leverage the size and strengths of Vulcan as a whole, while running their operations with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and sense of ownership, allows us to deliver market-leading services to our customers.
Transportation costs are passed along to our customers, and because aggregates have a very high weight-to-value ratio, those costs can add up quickly when transporting aggregates long distances. Having the most extensive distribution network of any aggregates producer sets us apart. Combining our trucking, rail, barge and ocean vessel shipping logistics capabilities allows us to provide better customer solutions and create a seamless customer experience at a competitive price.

As an approximation, a truck has a capacity of 20-25 tons of aggregates; a railcar has a capacity of 4-5 truckloads; a barge has a capacity of 65 truckloads and our ocean vessels have the capacity of 2,500 truckloads.

OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT
We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines: (1) Aggregates, (2) Asphalt, (3) Concrete and (4) Calcium. Management reviews earnings for our reporting segments principally at the gross profit level.
1. AGGREGATES
Our year-over-year aggregates shipments:
increased 7% in 2021 1
decreased 3% in 2020
increased 7% in 2019

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Of the 7% increase in 2021 shipments, 2% was attributable to the August 26, 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete.

Total aggregates shipments increased 7% (5% on a same-store basis), reflecting improving demand across most end-markets.

Our year-over-year freight-adjusted selling price1 for aggregates:
increased 3.0% in 2021
increased 3.2% in 2020
increased 5.6% in 2019

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 We routinely arrange the delivery of our aggregates to the customer. Additionally, we incur freight costs to move aggregates from the production site to remote distribution sites. These costs are passed on to our customers in the aggregates price. We remove these pass-through freight & delivery revenues (and any other aggregates-derived revenues, such as landfill tipping fees) from the freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates. See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this Item 7 for a reconciliation of freight-adjusted revenues.

Part II 47

As demand visibility improved, the pricing environment continued to strengthen and the rate of pricing growth improved sequentially each quarter this year. Freight-adjusted pricing increased 3.0% (same-store increased 3.0% and same-store mix-adjusted increased 3.2%) with the growth widespread across geographies.

 1 Freight-adjusted sales price is calculated as freight-adjusted revenues divided by aggregates unit shipments

Aggregates segment gross profit increased 12% to $1,295.7 million, or $5.81 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton improved 5% from the prior year to $7.43. The earnings improvement was widespread across our footprint and resulted from both volume and price growth, as well as effective cost control. This year’s results include a $10.7 million unfavorable impact from selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of the U.S. Concrete acquisition and a $41.4 million unfavorable impact from significantly higher diesel fuel costs.
On a same-store basis, unit gross profit increased 7% to $5.95 per ton and cash gross profit per ton improved 5% from the prior year to $7.48. This improvement was driven by 5% same-store volume growth, 3.0% price growth and an increase in freight-adjusted cash costs of less than 1% despite a more than 50% increase in diesel fuel prices.
Solid operational execution mostly offset higher costs for diesel fuel, inflation for certain parts and supplies, and operational disruptions caused by labor shortages. Freight-adjusted unit cost of sales increased only 2% despite the significant increase in diesel fuel prices. Positive pricing opportunities and improved operating efficiencies are expected to continue to help offset some of the cost inflation going forward.

2. ASPHALT
Our year-over-year asphalt mix shipments:
decreased 4% in 2021
decreased 7% in 2020
increased 12% in 2019
Asphalt segment gross profit decreased from $75.2 million in the prior year to $21.2 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to sharply higher costs for liquid asphalt ($41.2 million impact) and a rise in natural gas prices ($6.4 million impact). Asphalt volumes decreased 4% from the prior year. Volume growth in California, our largest asphalt market, was more than offset by lower volumes in Arizona, our second largest market. Efforts to mitigate the earnings impact of energy inflation will continue with positive results expected to contribute to unit profitability improvement in 2022.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Excluding the August 26, 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete, ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 7%.

Concrete segment gross profit increased $10.1 million to $54.3 million. Earnings contributions from the U.S. Concrete operations more than offset the earnings impact from lower volumes in our legacy Virginia operations. The lower volumes were due mostly to the timing of several large projects that were completed in the prior year. Material margins increased in our legacy operations despite lower volumes.

SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) EXPENSES
in millions

As a percentage of total revenues, SAG expense was:
7.5% in 2021 — increased 0.10 percentage points (10 basis points)
7.4% in 2020 — decreased 0.10 percentage points (10 basis points)
7.5% in 2019 — decreased 0.10 percentage points (10 basis points)
Our comparative total company employment levels at year end:
increased 26% in 2021
decreased 2% in 2020
increased 6% in 2019
The 2021 increase in our employment level was primarily the result of our August 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). As noted above, 2021 SAG expenses were $417.6 million or 7.5% as a percentage of total revenues, up from 7.4% in 2020. The current year includes overhead expenses associated with the U.S. Concrete business that were not in the prior year. Additionally, increased routine business development activities and more normalized travel expenses, due in part to integration activities, contributed to the increase. We remain focused on further leveraging our overhead cost structure.
GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES
in millions

The 2021 gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses of $120.1 million includes a net pretax gain of $114.7 from the sale of Southern California real estate (previously mined land that we reclaimed for commercial and retail development). We remain focused on our efforts to maximize the value of our portfolio of quarry operations as they move through their life-cycle of land management. The 2020 gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses of $4.0 million includes a net immaterial pretax loss from ready-mixed concrete divestitures. See Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE, NET
Other operating expense, which has an approximate run-rate of $12.0 million a year (exclusive of discrete items), is composed primarily of idle facilities expense, environmental remediation costs, property abandonments and gain (loss) on settlement of AROs. Total other operating expense and significant discrete items included in the total were:
$65.1 million in 2021 — includes discrete items as follows:
$1.5 million of charges associated with divested operations
$28.3 million of non-routine business development charges
$13.4 million of charges related to COVID-19 pandemic direct incremental costs
$15.0 million of managerial restructuring charges
$30.0 million in 2020 — includes discrete items as follows:
$6.9 million of charges associated with divested operations, composed entirely of environmental liability accruals associated with previously divested properties
$7.3 million of non-routine business development charges
$10.2 million of charges related to COVID-19 pandemic direct incremental costs
OTHER NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
Other nonoperating income (expense) (2021 — $10.7 million, 2020 — $(17.5) million and 2019 — $9.2 million) is composed primarily of pension and postretirement benefit costs (excluding service costs), foreign currency transaction gains/losses, Rabbi Trust gains/losses and net earnings/losses of nonconsolidated equity method investments. Additionally, during 2021 and 2020, we incurred $12.1 million and $22.7 million, respectively, of non-cash pension settlement charges — these partial settlements will benefit future expense and funding requirements (see Note 10 “Benefit Plans” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).
INTEREST EXPENSE
in millions

Interest expense was $149.3 million in 2021 compared to $136.0 million in 2020. This increase resulted primarily from an additional $9.4 million of interest expense related to financing the acquisition of U.S. Concrete. See Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion.

INCOME TAXES
Our income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is shown below:

----------------------------------- ------- ------- -------

dollars in millions 2021 2020 2019
Earnings from continuing operations
before income taxes $ 873.8 $ 743.8 $ 757.7
Income tax expense $ 200.1 $ 155.8 $ 135.2
Effective tax rate 22.9% 20.9% 17.8%

The $44.3 million increase in our 2021 income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in earnings from continuing operations and the increase of our Alabama net operating loss (NOL) valuation allowance. The $20.6 million increase in our 2020 income tax expense was primarily related to a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a smaller research & development tax credit.
In February 2021, the Alabama Business Competitiveness Act was signed into law. This Act contained a provision requiring most taxpayers to change from a three-factor, double-weighted sales method to a single-sales factor method to apportion income to Alabama. This provision had the effect of significantly reducing our apportionment of income to Alabama, thereby further inhibiting our ability to utilize our Alabama NOL carryforward. As a result, in the first quarter of 2021, we increased the valuation allowance by $13.7 million. No other material tax impacts resulted from the enactment of this Act.
See Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Pretax loss from discontinued operations were:
$(4.5) million in 2021
$(4.7) million in 2020
$(6.5) million in 2019
Pretax loss from discontinued operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019, resulted primarily from general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. For additional information about discontinued operations, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption Discontinued Operations.
KNOWN TRENDS OR UNCERTAINTIES
As described above in the Executive Summary, inflationary pressures and labor constraints were trends impacting our operations in 2021. Although inflationary pressures can create short- to medium-term headwinds, the combination of inflation and improving visibility of demand has created and may continue to create a favorable environment for price increases. Additionally, labor constraints (especially truck drivers) have caused delays and inefficiencies in our operations as well as those of our customers. If labor constraints continue and demand remains strong, our operations may proceed at a slower pace, which may effectively extend the recovery while allowing us the opportunity to compound price, control costs and grow earnings. Further, recently, the Mexican government has taken actions that adversely affect our operations in that country, including delays in issuing a historically routine three-year customs permit for our deep-water port. Mexico instead issued a short-term customs permit that must be renewed after two months. While we continue to negotiate with the Mexican authorities to reach a mutually agreeable and beneficial solution, failure by the Mexican government to issue future customs permits or its taking of any other measures that force us to cease our operations in Mexico would have an adverse effect on our ability to supply customers.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
SAME-STORE
We have provided certain information on a same-store basis. When discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods, we may exclude the operating results of recently acquired/divested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. These recently acquired/divested businesses are disclosed in Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” This approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis. We believe that measuring performance on a same-store basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our same-store information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
AGGREGATES SEGMENT FREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES
Aggregates segment freight-adjusted revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We present this measure as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Additionally, we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

AGGREGATES SEGMENT INCREMENTAL GROSS PROFIT
Aggregates segment incremental gross profit flow-through rate is not a GAAP measure and represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in segment sales excluding freight & delivery (revenues and costs). This metric should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We present this metric as it with freight & delivery, which are pass-through activities.

CASH GROSS PROFIT
GAAP does not define “cash gross profit,” and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. Additionally, we present this metric as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. Cash gross profit adds back noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization to gross profit. Aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing Aggregates segment cash gross profit by tons shipped. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA
GAAP does not define “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization” (EBITDA), and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period.

return on invested capital
We define “Return on Invested Capital” (ROIC) as Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing-twelve months divided by average invested capital (as illustrated below) during the trailing 5-quarters. Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric EBITDA. We believe that our ROIC metric is meaningful because it helps investors assess how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial, committed bank line of credit. Additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets, the sale of surplus real estate, and dispositions of nonstrategic operating assets. We believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2022, including:
contractual obligations
debt service obligations
capital expenditures
potential acquisitions
dividend payments
potential share repurchases
During 2022, we expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million on capital expenditures, including growth and capacity-adding projects. Excluding future cash requirements for capital expenditures, our obligations to make future contractual payments as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the table below:

As of December 31, 2021, we were contingently liable for $860.2 million within 558 surety bonds underwritten by various surety companies. These bonds guarantee our performance and are required primarily by states and municipalities and their related agencies. The top five in amount totaled $206.0 million (24%) and were for certain construction contracts and

reclamation obligations. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriting companies against any exposure under the surety bonds. No material claims have been made against our surety bonds.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities.
Our balanced approach to capital deployment remains unchanged. We intend to balance reinvestment in our business, growth through acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders, while sustaining financial strength and flexibility.
We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to balance the cost of capital and the risk of financial stress. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:
maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity
proactively manage our debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low
maintain an appropriate balance of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt
minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility
As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity sources and needs and take appropriate actions.
CASH
Included in our December 31, 2021 cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances of $241.5 million is $6.5 million of restricted cash (see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption Restricted Cash).

Days sales outstanding, a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables, were 47.6 days at December 31, 2021 compared to 44.9 days at December 31, 2020. Additionally, our over 90 day balance of $46.0 million at December 31, 2021 was up significantly from $15.5 million at December 31, 2020. Excluding customer receivables from the recent U.S. Concrete acquisition, both days sales outstanding (44.4 days) and over 90 day balances ($8.5 million) were favorable compared to the prior year. All customer accounts are actively managed and no losses in excess of amounts reserved are currently expected.

2021 versus 2020 — Net cash used for investing activities was $1,874.1 million during 2021, a $1,492.6 million increase compared to 2020. During 2021, we invested $451.3 million in our existing operations, an $89.1 million increase compared to 2020. Of this $451.3 million, $169.6 million was invested in internal growth projects to enhance our distribution capabilities, develop new production sites and enhance existing production facilities and other growth opportunities. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment were up $205.0 million from 2020 primarily reflecting the sale of reclaimed real estate in Southern California. Additionally, during 2021 we acquired businesses for $1,639.4 million of cash consideration (including $1,634.5 million for U.S. Concrete) as compared to $43.2 million of cash consideration for businesses in 2020 (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”).

2021 VERSUS 2020 — Net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was $94.3 million, compared to $234.6 million provided in 2020. The 2021 activities include: a) cash paid to retire the $500.0 million floating rate notes due March 2021, b) $13.3 million of financing costs for a new bridge facility and delayed draw term loan facility (see Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”), c) initial proceeds of $1,600.0 million from the August draw on the delayed draw term loan facility, d) the subsequent pay down of $500.0 million on the delayed draw term loan facility, and e) $434.5 million of cash paid in September to retire U.S. Concrete’s outstanding notes assumed in the acquisition. The 2020 activity includes: a) net cash proceeds of $734.6 million for the issuance of new debt, b) cash paid to retire the $250.0 million floating rate notes due 2020 and c) $19.9 million of cash paid to settle interest rate derivatives.
Additionally, capital returned to our shareholders decreased by $9.9 million as higher dividends of $16.2 million ($1.48 per share compared to $1.36 per share) were offset by lower share repurchases of $26.1 million (no shares repurchased compared to 214,338 shares @ $121.92 per share).

At December 31, 2021, total debt to 2021 adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times or 2.5 times on a net debt basis reflecting $241.5 million of cash on hand. Our weighted-average debt maturity was 11.3 years, and the effective weighted-average interest rate was 3.68%.
BRIDGE FACILITY, DELAYED DRAW TERM LOAN AND LINE OF CREDIT
In June 2021, concurrent with the announcement of the pending acquisition of U.S. Concrete (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information), we obtained a $2,200.0 million bridge facility commitment from Truist Bank. Later, in June 2021, we entered into a $1,600.0 million delayed draw term loan with a subset of the banks that provide our line of credit and terminated the bridge facility commitment. The delayed draw term loan was drawn in August 2021 for $1,600.0 million in connection with the acquisition of U.S. Concrete and was paid down to $1,100.0 million in September 2021. Amounts repaid are no longer available for borrowing and any outstanding borrowings are due August 2024. The delayed draw term loan contains covenants customary for an unsecured investment-grade facility and mirror those in our line of credit. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the delayed draw term loan covenants. Borrowings, cost ranges and other details are described in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing costs for the bridge facility commitment and the delayed draw term loan facility totaled $13.3 million, $9.4 million of which was recognized as interest expense in 2021.
In September 2020, we executed a new five-year unsecured line of credit of $1,000.0 million, incurring $4.6 million of deferred transaction costs. Covenants, borrowings, cost ranges and other details are described in Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants, the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings was 1.125%, the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 0.125%, and the commitment fee for the unused portion was 0.100%.
As of December 31, 2021, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $940.4 million. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:
none was borrowed
$59.6 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit

TERM DEBT
Essentially all of our $3,949.6 million (face value) of term debt (which includes the $1,100.0 million delayed draw term loan) is unsecured. $2,840.2 million of such debt is governed by two essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all term debt covenants.
In August 2021, we assumed $434.5 million (fair value) of senior notes due 2029 in connection with the acquisition of U.S. Concrete and retired these notes in September 2021.
In May 2020, we issued $750.0 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2030. Total proceeds were $741.4 million (net of discounts and transaction costs). $250.0 million of the proceeds were used to retire the $250.0 million floating rate notes due June 2020. The remainder of the proceeds, together with cash on hand, was used to retire the $500.0 million floating rate notes due in March 2021.
For additional information regarding term debt, see Note 6 “Debt” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
DEBT PAYMENTS AND MATURITIES
Scheduled debt payments during 2021 included the aforementioned $500.0 million to retire the floating rate notes due in March, $9.4 million in July and $6.0 million in October. Scheduled debt payments during 2020 were $250.0 million in June.
As of December 31, 2021, maturities for the next four quarters and for the next five years are as follows (excluding any borrowings on the line of credit):

LIBOR TRANSITION
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), historically quoted in five currencies (including U.S. dollar) and seven tenors (from overnight to 12 months), is used extensively globally as a reference rate for financial contracts (e.g., corporate bonds and loans) and commercial contracts (e.g., real estate leases). In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to cease publishing LIBOR at year end 2021. In March 2021, FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR, announced that publication of LIBOR would cease at year end 2021, except for U.S. dollar LIBOR in five tenors that will be published through June 2023.

------- --

Part II 63

The expected discontinuation of LIBOR led to the formation of working groups in the U.S. and elsewhere to recommend alternative reference rates. The U.S. working group is the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The ARRC has selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative to LIBOR and helped establish standard language for credit agreements to address the pending change from LIBOR to SOFR (Transition Language). The Transition Language includes credit spread adjustment language intended to, based on the historical relationship of 1- month LIBOR and SOFR, make the transition indifferent to both lenders and borrowers.
As of December 31, 2021, we had two material debt instruments with LIBOR as a reference rate: 1) our $1,000.0 million line of credit ($0.0 million outstanding) and 2) our delayed draw term loan facility ($1,100.0 million outstanding). These two instruments contain the Transition Language, and we expect our borrowing costs to change immaterially when these two instruments move from LIBOR to SOFR.

Part II 64

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1.Goodwill impairment
2.Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill
3.Business combinations and purchase price allocation
4.Pension and other postretirement benefits
5.Environmental compliance costs
6.Claims and litigation including self-insurance
7.Income taxes
1. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2021, goodwill represents 27% of total assets), and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment.
HOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have identified 19 reporting units (of which 11 carry goodwill) based primarily on geographic location. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.
The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess.
HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE
We determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). We consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. Finally, to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization.

------- --

Part II 65

OUR FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
We base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.
The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and, if applicable, acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.
RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS
The results of our annual impairment tests for 2019 through 2021 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (in excess of 100%) their carrying values. Allocation of the purchase price for the U.S. Concrete acquisition (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) has not been finalized and therefore these operations were excluded from our goodwill impairment tests.
For additional information about goodwill, see Note 18 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
2. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2021, net property, plant & equipment represents 41% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 13% of total assets), and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
Fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.
We test long-lived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) impacts the profitability of the downstream business.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded no material losses on impairment of long-lived assets.

------- --

Part II 66

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being used in our operations. These assets totaled $516.2 million at December 31, 2021, representing an 11% increase from December 31, 2020. Of the total $516.2 million, approximately 40% relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations. In addition, approximately 15% is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining 45% is composed of aggregates, asphalt and concrete operating assets idled temporarily. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For additional information about long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 “Property, Plant & Equipment” and Note 18 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
Our strategic long-term plans include potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses. When an acquisition is completed, our consolidated statements of comprehensive income includes the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained.
HOW WE DETERMINE AND ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE
The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. Additionally, the amounts assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can significantly affect our results of operations.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction and therefore represents an exit price. A fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
‎Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data
‎Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
Level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly-traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly-traded long-term debt.
Level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired machinery and equipment, land, buildings, and assumed liabilities for asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations. Additionally, Level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.
Level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests (referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place) and other identifiable intangible assets. We determine the fair values of owned mineral reserves and leased mineral interests using a lost profits approach and/or an excess earnings approach. These valuation techniques require management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, shipment volumes, production costs and capital needs. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.

------- --

Part II 67

Other identifiable intangible assets may include, but are not limited to, noncompetition agreements. The fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or a market approach.
MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS
We may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined. The measurement period ends once we have obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.
4. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits requires that we use assumptions for the valuation of projected benefit obligations (PBO) and the performance of plan assets. Each year, we review our assumptions for discount rates (used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations) and the expected return on plan assets. Due to plan changes made in 2013, annual pay increases do not materially impact plan obligations.
DISCOUNT RATES — We use a high-quality bond full yield curve approach (specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow) to establish the discount rates at each measurement date.
EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS — Our expected return on plan assets is: (1) a long-term view based on our current asset allocation, and (2) a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary.
RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS — We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits.
See Note 10 “Benefit Plans” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for the discount rates used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations; the expected return on plan assets; and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits.
Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the PBO and the annual net benefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

------------------------------ ----------------------------- ----------------------------- ------------------- ------------------ -------------------

 (Favorable) Unfavorable
 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease
 Inc (Dec) in Inc (Dec) in Inc (Dec) in Inc (Dec) in
in millions Benefit Obligation Annual Benefit Cost Benefit Obligation Annual Benefit Cost

Pension $ (51.1) $ 0.0 $ 56.3 $ 0.7
Other postretirement benefits (1.7) (0.1) 1.9 0.1
Expected return on plan assets not applicable (4.2) not applicable 4.2

As of the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the fair value of our pension plan assets decreased from $944.3 million for the prior year-end to $860.5 million due primarily to the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (annuity lift-out), partially offset by favorable market performance. Our postretirement plans are unfunded.
The discount rate is the weighted-average of the spot rates for each cash flow on the yield curve for high-quality bonds as of the measurement date. As of the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the PBO of our pension plans decreased from $1,059.5 million to $915.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in discount rates for the plans (approximately 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points) and the annuity lift-out. The PBO of our postretirement plans increased from $33.9 million to $46.0 million. This increase was primarily due to a change in plan design. Effective October 1, 2021, the retiree medical plans were updated for non-grandfathered participants to provide a subsidy equal to 70% of the Gold PPO premium.

------- --

Part II 68

During 2022, we expect to recognize net pension expense of $1.9 million and net postretirement expense of $1.3 million compared to expense of $3.1 million (which includes a $12.1 million settlement charge) and income of $1.2 million, respectively, in 2021. Excluding the settlement charge, the expected increase in pension expense is primarily due to a reduction in the long-term return on asset assumption from 5.25% to 4.00%. The increase in postretirement expense is primarily due to increased benefits for non-grandfathered participants as described above.
We do not anticipate that contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2022, and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution. We currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.
For additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 “Benefit Plans” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS
Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.
HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
To account for environmental costs, we:
expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy
expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues
accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost
At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. If no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2021, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $3.1 million — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.
Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. However, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.
For additional information about environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 “Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

------- --

Part II 69

6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE
We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $10.0 million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.
Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.
Our accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.
HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS
We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and we establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.
For additional information about claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.
7. INCOME TAXES
VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.
Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items. We are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted.
Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

------- --

Part II 70

LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS
We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.
Generally, we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years before 2018. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.
We consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled,” settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The 27 net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions.

Note 9 -- Derivative Instruments During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into two foreign currency swap agreements. The objective of both agreements is to manage the risk of changes in cash flows resulting from foreign currency gains/losses realized upon remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated SCL senior notes by swapping a specified amount of Hong Kong dollars for U.S. dollars at the contractual spot rate. The terms in one of the contracts did not effectively match the terms of the related SCL senior notes; thus, it was not designated as hedging (the "Non-Hedging Swap"). The remaining contract was designated as a hedge of the cash flows related to a portion of the SCL senior notes (the "Hedging Swap," and together with the Non-Hedging Swap, the "FX Swaps"). The Non-Hedging Swap and the Hedging Swap have a total notional value of $500 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and expire in August 2023 and August 2025, respectively. The total fair value of the FX Swaps is recorded as an asset in other assets, net. The fair value of the FX Swaps was estimated using Level 2 inputs from recently reported market transactions of foreign currency exchange rates. For the Hedging Swap, the changes in fair value of the derivative were recognized as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the foreign currency gains/losses incurred from the remeasurement of the portion of the SCL senior notes being hedged were also recognized in other comprehensive income. For the Non-Hedging Swap the changes in fair value of the derivative were recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In August 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements (the "IR Swaps"), which qualified and were designated as fair value hedges, swapping fixed-rate for variable-rate interest to hedge changes in the fair value of the 2023, 2025 and 2028 SCL Senior Notes. These IR Swaps had a total not...

NOTE 18. LEASES We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. Prior to our adoption of ASC 842 in fiscal 2020, operating lease expense was $170 million for fiscal 2019. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operating lease expense is net of sublease income and includes variable lease costs, both of which are not material. Supplemental cash flow information for fiscal 2021 and 2020 related to operating leases was as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ---- - -- (in millions) 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 116 $ 99 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 60 $ 52 The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating lease liabilities as of December 3, 2021 were 8 years and 2.28%, respectively.

(4)As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance Corporation ("General Finance"), which was a leading provider of mobile storage equipment and modular office space. Prior to the General Finance acquisition, we did not rent material amounts of such equipment. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in "Management's Discussion and Anal...

The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. 80 ADOBE INC.

Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 74 ----------------- ------------- Alphabet Inc.

LIBOR TRANSITION
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), historically quoted in five currencies (including U.S. dollar) and seven tenors (from overnight to 12 months), is used extensively globally as a reference rate for financial contracts (e.g., corporate bonds and loans) and commercial contracts (e.g., real estate leases). In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), of LIBOR would cease at year end 2021, except for U.S. dollar LIBOR in five tenors that will be published through June 2023.

------- --

Part II 63

The expected discontinuation of LIBOR led to the formation to address the pending change from LIBOR to SOFR (Transition Language). The Transition Language includes credit spread adjustment language intended to, based on the historical relationship of 1- month LIBOR and SOFR, make the transition indifferent to both lenders and borrowers.
As of December 31, 2021, we had two material debt instruments with LIBOR as a reference rate: 1) our $1,000.0 million line of credit ($0.0 million outstanding) and 2) our delayed draw term loan facility ($1,100.0 million outstanding). These two instruments contain the Transition Language, and we expect our borrowing costs to change immaterially when these two instruments move from LIBOR to SOFR.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1.Goodwill impairment
2.Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill
3.Business combinations and purchase price allocation
4.Pension and other postretirement benefits
5.Environmental compliance costs
6.Claims and litigation including self-insurance
7.Income taxes
1. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2021, goodwill represents 27% of total assets), and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment.
HOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have identified 19 reporting units (of which 11 carry goodwill) their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.
The quantitative impairment test compares the value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess.
HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE
We determine the carrying value of each reporting 

------- --

Part II 65

OUR FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
We base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.
The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. derived using a capital asset pricing model.
RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS
The results of our annual impairment tests for 2019 through 2021 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with Statements and Supplementary Data”) has not been finalized and therefore these operations were excluded from our goodwill impairment tests.
For additional information about goodwill, see Note 18 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
2. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
Fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.
We test long-lived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) impacts the profitability of the downstream business.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded no material losses on impairment of long-lived assets.

Part II 66

We maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being used in our operations. These assets totaled $516.2 million that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For additional information about long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 “Property, Plant & Equipment” and Note 18 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
Our strategic long-term plans include potential investments in value-added acquisitions acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained.
HOW WE DETERMINE AND ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE
The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can significantly affect our results of operations.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
‎Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data
‎Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
Level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly-traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly-traded long-term debt.
Level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired machinery and equipment, at other-than-market rates.
Level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves as well as leased mineral interests (referred to in our financial statements as contractual rights in place) a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.

MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS
We may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are the year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.
4. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Accounting for discount rates (used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations) and the expected return on plan assets. Due to plan changes made in 2013, annual pay increases do not materially impact plan obligations.
DISCOUNT RATES — We use a high-quality bond full yield curve approach (specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow) to establish the discount rates at each measurement date.
 consultant and our pension plans’ actuary.
RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS — We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits.
See Note rate of increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits.
Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the PBO and the annual net benefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

------------------------------ ----------------------------- ----------------------------- ------------------- ------------------ -------------------

As of the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the fair value of our pension plan assets decreased from $944.3 million for the prior year-end to $860.5 million due primarily to the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (annuity lift-out), partially offset by favorable market performance. Our postretirement plans are unfunded.
The discount updated for non-grandfathered participants to provide a subsidy equal to 70% of the Gold PPO premium.

Part II 68

During 2022, we expect to recognize net pension expense of $1.9 million and to increased benefits for non-grandfathered participants as described above.
We do not anticipate that contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2022, and we do not anticipate levels or plan administration.
For additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 “Benefit Plans” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS
Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.
HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
To account for environmental costs, we:
expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy
expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues
accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost
At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.
Accrual amounts may be However, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.
For additional information about environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 “Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE
We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers']:
NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.
