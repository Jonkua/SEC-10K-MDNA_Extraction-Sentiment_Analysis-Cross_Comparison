Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Strategic Direction of Our Business

Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative new medicines in areas of high unmet medical need. Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain. We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates. These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action. We continue to make significant investments in building and advancing our pipeline of proprietary drug candidates as we believe that this is the best strategy to build long-term stockholder value.

In immuno-oncology, we are executing a broad clinical development for NKTR-214 in collaboration with BMS as well as other independent development work evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with other agents with potential complementary mechanisms of action. We expect our research and development expense to continue to grow over the next few years as we expand and execute a very broad clinical development program for NKTR-214. For development work within our collaboration development plan, we share development costs based on each party’s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimen. For example, we share development costs for NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo®, BMS 67.5% and Nektar 32.5%, and for NKTR-214 in a triplet combination with Opdivo® and Yervoy®, BMS 78% and Nektar 22%. For costs of producing NKTR-214, however, BMS is responsible for 35% and Nektar is responsible for 65% of costs. Under our collaboration development plan, we have started registration enabling studies in first line melanoma, first line renal cell carcinoma, cisplatin ineligible, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, second line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (post-checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy), and several more registrational studies in additional tumor types and indications are planned to begin in 2019. Our share of such development costs under the collaboration development plan is limited to an annual cap of $125 million. To the extent this annual cap is exceeded, we will recognize our full share of the research and development expense and BMS will reimburse us for the amount over the annual cap and it will be recorded as a contingent liability. This contingent liability will be paid to BMS only if NKTR-214 is approved and solely by reducing our share of a portion of our net profits following the first commercial sale of NKTR-214. In addition, under the BMS collaboration agreement, we are entitled to $1.43 billion of regulatory and commercial launch milestones, $650 million of which are associated with approval and launch of NKTR-214 in its first indication in the U.S., EU and Japan. As a result, whether and when NKTR-214 is approved in any indication will have a significant impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.

Outside of the collaboration development plan with BMS, we are conducting a broad array of development activities evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with other agents that have potential complementary mechanisms of action. Our strategic objective is to establish NKTR-214 as a key component of many immuno-oncology combination regimens with the potential to enhance the standard of care in multiple oncology settings. On November 6, 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Pfizer to evaluate several combination regimens in multiple cancer settings, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  The combination regimens in this collaboration will evaluate NKTR-214 with avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody in development by Merck KGaA, and Pfizer; talazoparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor developed by Pfizer; or enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor in development by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma Inc. In February 2019, we started a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with Takeda’s investigational medicine, TAK-659, a dual inhibitor of both spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and FLT-3, in up to 40 patients with advanced non-hodgkin lymphoma. We are planning a Phase 1 study this year in pancreatic cancer patients in collaboration with BioXcel to evaluate a triplet combination of NKTR-214, BXCL-701 (a small molecule immune-modulator, DPP 8/9), and avelumab being supplied to BioXcel by Pfizer and Merck KGaA. We are also working in collaboration with Vaccibody AS to evaluate in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study combining NKTR-214 with Vaccibody’s personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine. With our non-BMS clinical collaborations for NKTR-214, we generally equally share clinical development costs on a substantially pro-rata basis. We expect to continue to make significant and increasing investments exploring the potential of NKTR-214 with mechanisms of action that we believe are synergistic with NKTR-214 based on emerging scientific findings in cancer biology and preclinical development work.

We are also advancing other molecules in our immuno-oncology portfolio. NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to stimulate the innate immune system and promote maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as an intra-tumoral injection in combination with systemic NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. The Phase 1 dose-escalation trial is currently ongoing. NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets

51

the interleukin-15 (IL-15) pathway in order to activate the body’s innate and adaptive immunity. Signaling of the IL-15 pathway enhances the survival and function of natural killer (NK) cells and induces survival of both effector and CD8 memory T cells. Preclinical findings suggest NKTR-255 has potential to synergistically combine with antibody dependent cellular toxicity molecules as well as enhance CAR-T therapies. NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development and we plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 this year and begin a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in multiple myeloma. Over the next several years, we plan to continue to make significant investments to advance our early drug candidate pipeline.

In immunology, we are developing NKTR-358, which is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body that occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. NKTR-358 is designed to optimally target the IL-2 receptor complex in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells. NKTR-358 is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases. In 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) to co-develop NKTR-358. We received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to an additional $250.0 million for development and regulatory milestones. We are responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities. We also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us. We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the Phase 3 development costs. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.  We have completed the first Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 100 healthy patients. The study has completed enrollment. The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was initiated in May of 2018 and is currently enrolling patients. Over the next several years, we plan to continue to fund our share of the development costs under this collaboration.

In pain, we have filed the NDA for NKTR-181 for the treatment of chronic low back pain in adult opioid-naïve patients and the FDA’s current Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date is August 29, 2019. NKTR-181 met its primary and key secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study in opioid-naïve patients with chronic low back pain and also demonstrated positive results in a pivotal human abuse potential study, long-term safety study, and several other clinical and non-clinical studies included in the NDA data package. If approved, we plan to commercialize NKTR-181 through a separate subsidiary company with one or more partners with commercial infrastructure and expertise and one or more strategic capital partners. Since we have not yet completed our work to establish a commercial launch capability for NTKR-181, there remains substantial risk and uncertainties related to successful and timely completion of establishing this commercialization infrastructure for NKTR-181.

The level of our future research and development investment will depend on a number of trends and uncertainties including clinical outcomes, future studies required to advance programs to regulatory approval, and the economics related to potential future collaborations that may include up-front payments, development funding, milestones, and royalties.

We have historically derived all of our revenue and substantial amounts of operating capital from our collaboration agreements including the BMS collaboration for NKTR-214 that was completed on April 3, 2018, pursuant to which we recognized $1.06 billion in revenue and recorded $790.2 million in additional paid in capital for shares of our common stock issued in the transaction. While in the near-term we continue to expect to generate substantially all of our revenue from collaboration arrangements, including the potential $1.43 billion in development and regulatory milestones under the BMS collaboration, in the medium- to long-term our plan is to generate significant revenue from proprietary products including NKTR-181 and NKTR-214. Since we do not have experience commercializing products or an established commercialization organization, there will be substantial risks and uncertainties in future years as we build commercial, organizational, and operational capabilities.

We also receive royalties and milestone from two approved drugs. We have a collaboration with AstraZeneca for MOVANTIK®, an oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with non-cancer pain which was approved and subsequently launched in March 2015 and MOVENTIG®, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients who have an inadequate response to laxatives, which was approved by health authorities in the European Union and many other countries beginning in 2014. We have a collaboration with Baxalta (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda) for ADYNOVATE®, that was approved by the FDA in late 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. ADYNOVITM was approved by health authorities in Europe in January 2018, and has also been approved in many other countries.

Our business is subject to significant risks, including the risks inherent in our development efforts, the results of our clinical trials, our dependence on the marketing efforts by our collaboration partners, uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products. For a discussion of these and some of the other key risks and uncertainties affecting our business, see Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

While the approved drugs and clinical development programs described above are key elements of our future success, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline. We have

52

several drug candidates in earlier stage clinical development or being explored in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years. We are also advancing several other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, immunology, and other therapeutic indications. We believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results, receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets and achieves commercial success, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult to predict. Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial condition and prospects, results of operations and market value.

Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources

We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans through at least March 1, 2020. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.9 billion in cash and investments in marketable securities and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes due in October 2020.

As described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 supersedes the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We adopted ASC 606 on a modified retrospective basis under which we recognized the $12.7 million cumulative effect of adoption as a reduction to opening accumulated deficit. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was recorded under ASC 605, while revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was recorded under ASC 606. If we had continued to use ASC 605 during 2018, revenue would have been $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary difference between revenue recognition under ASC 605 and ASC 606 during 2018 relates to the recognition of royalty revenue for certain of our royalty programs. Under ASC 605, we recognized certain of our royalty arrangements on a cash basis, generally one quarter in arrears. Under ASC 606, we recognize royalty revenue and related sales milestones when the underlying sales occur based on our best estimates of sales of the drugs.

Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, and license fees, as well as development and sales milestones and other contingent payments. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when we transfer promised goods or services to our collaboration partners. The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, is generally recognized as we deliver products or provide development services. As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue. We make our best estimate of the timing and amount of products and services expected to be required to fulfill our performance obligations. Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required to make these estimates.

Product sales

Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners. The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.

53

Product sales decreased for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to decreased product demand from our collaboration partner Ophthotech related to its drug candidate Fovista®. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $10.4 million of product sales to Ophthotech based on prior binding purchase commitments. Our agreement with Ophthotech was terminated in October 2017 following Ophthotech’s announcement that the third and final Fovista® Phase 3 trial also failed to meet its primary endpoint, following previous failures of the first two studies.

We expect product sales in 2019 to be consistent with 2018. However, if NKTR-181 receives regulatory approval and commercial sales begin in 2019, we expect an increase in product sales in 2019 compared to 2018.

Royalty revenue

We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products. Royalty revenue increased for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, due primarily to the annual sales growth of ADYNOVATE® /ADYNOVITM in 2018 and 2017 and MOVANTIK®/ MOVENTIG® in 2017. We expect royalty revenue in 2019 to increase marginally as compared to 2018.

As part of its approval of MOVANTIK®, the FDA required AstraZeneca to perform a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK® to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. As a result, the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of MOVANTIK® in the U.S. by AstraZeneca can be reduced by up to two percentage points to fund 33% of the external costs incurred by AstraZeneca to fund such post approval study, subject to a $35.0 million aggregate cap. As of December 31, 2018, our cumulative share of the post-approval study expenses since 2015 has been $1.3 million. Any costs incurred by AstraZeneca can only be recovered by the reduction of the royalty paid to us. In no case can amounts be recovered by the reduction of a contingent payment due from AstraZeneca to us or through a payment from us to AstraZeneca.

Non-cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties

In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA® and MIRCERA®. As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period. As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties. We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® in 2019 to increase marginally compared to 2018.

License, collaboration and other revenue

License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments, milestone and other contingent payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and certain research and development activities. The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated recognition period of the upfront payments allocated to continuing performance obligations, the achievement of milestones and other contingent events, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.

License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the recognition of $1,059.8 million from the BMS Collaboration Agreement as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we recognized a $10.0 million milestone payment received in March 2018 as a result of the marketing authorization of ADYNOVITM in the EU in January 2018, and we recognized an additional $10.0 million milestone in the fourth quarter of 2018 for annual sales of ADYNOVATE® reaching a certain specified amount. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $11.6 million and $130.1 million, respectively, of the $150.0 million upfront payment we received in September 2017 from our collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly for NKTR-358 as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of revenue from the Lilly collaboration described above. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $34.7 million related to the termination of our collaboration agreements with Bayer and Ophthotech as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases in 2017 were partially offset by the recognition of $28.0 million in March 2016 for our 40% share of the $70.0 million sublicense payment received by AstraZeneca from Kirin for sublicense rights to MOVENTIG® in Europe.

We expect that our license, collaboration and other revenue will decrease significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the revenue recognized in 2018 for the BMS Collaboration Agreement.

54

The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors” for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.

Revenue by geography (in thousands)

Revenue by geographic area is based on the headquarters or shipping locations of our partners. The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area:

 Year Ended December 31,
------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- - ------- ---- - -------
 2018 2017 2016
United States $ 1,090,794 $ 190,810 $ 39,147
Europe 102,529 116,901 126,289
Total revenue $ 1,193,323 $ 307,711 $ 165,436

The increase in revenue attributable to the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the recognition of $1,059.8 million from the BMS Collaboration Agreement as described above. The increase in revenue attributable to the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the recognition of $130.1 million of the $150.0 million upfront payment we received from Lilly, as described above.

Cost of goods sold (in thousands, except percentages)

 Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs.
-------------------- ----------------------- ------ -- ----------------------------- - ------ ----------------------------- - ---------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ------- - ---- -- --- --
 2018 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
Cost of goods sold $ 24,412 $ 30,547 $ 30,215 $ (6,135 ) $ 332 (20 )% 1 %
Product gross profit (3,638 ) 2,141 25,139 (5,779 ) (22,998 ) (270 )% (91 )%
Product gross margin (18 )% 7 % 45 %

Our strategy is to manufacture and supply polymer reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit. We have elected to only enter into and maintain those manufacturing relationships associated with long-term collaboration agreements which include multiple sources of revenue, which we view holistically and in aggregate. We have a predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities. As a result, our product gross profit and margin are significantly impacted by the mix and volume of products sold in each period.

Cost of goods sold decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to decreased product sales. Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016. The decreases in product gross profit and product gross margin during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are primarily due to decreased product sales as well as a less favorable product mix in 2018 and 2017 compared to 2017 and 2016, respectively. In particular, we have a manufacturing arrangement with a partner that includes a fixed price which is less than the fully burdened manufacturing cost for the reagent, and we expect this situation to continue with this partner in future years. There were more shipments to this partner relative to shipments to other customers during 2018 and 2017 compared to 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition to product sales from reagent materials supplied to the partner where our sales are less than our fully burdened manufacturing cost, we also receive royalty revenue from this collaboration. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the royalty revenue from this collaboration exceeded the related negative gross profit.

We expect product gross margin to continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers. We currently expect product gross margin to be negative in 2019 as a result of the anticipated unfavorable product mix described above. However, if NKTR-181 receives regulatory approval and commercial sales begin, we expect an increase in product sales, which would improve our margin.

55

Research and development expense (in thousands, except percentages)

 Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs.
-------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ----------------------------- - ------- ----------------------------- - ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ------- ---- - ------ ---- -- - -- -
 2018 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
Research and development expense $ 399,536 $ 268,461 $ 203,801 $ 131,075 $ 64,660 49 % 32 %

Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, contract manufacturing costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation). Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs. Where we perform research and development activities under a clinical joint development collaboration, such as our collaboration with BMS, we record the expense reimbursement from our partners as a reduction to research and development expense, and we record our share of our partners’ expenses as an increase to research and development expense.

Research and development expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to our expanded clinical development of NKTR-214, NKTR-262, NKTR-358, and preclinical activities for NKTR-255, as well as pre-commercial manufacturing and costs related to our NDA filing for NKTR-181. In particular, we incurred significant contract manufacturing costs for NKTR-214 and other drug candidates for our broad clinical development for NKTR-214 under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, collaboration agreements with third parties and our own studies. In addition, the increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 includes increases in non-cash stock-based compensation and other personnel costs. These increases were partially offset by cost reimbursements by BMS under our collaboration agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded net reductions to research and development expense for BMS’ reimbursements of our expenses of $62.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, BMS bears 67.5% of expenses for development costs for NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo® and 35% of costs for producing NKTR-214. No reimbursement amounts were recorded in 2016.

Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and included increased costs for our clinical development of NKTR-214, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, and preclinical activities for NKTR-255, as well as increased costs for personnel and outside services.

We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs. The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as contract manufacturing costs for each of our drug candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):

(1) Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1. Business.

(2) The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 includes $47.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of development cost reimbursements from BMS under our collaboration, net of our share of BMS’ costs. No reimbursement amounts were recorded in 2016. Development expenses for NKTR-214 during 2018 include expenses under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, other collaboration agreements and our own studies.

(3) The amount for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $15.6 million of employee cost reimbursements from BMS under our collaboration. No reimbursement amounts were recorded in 2017 or 2016.

We expect research and development expense to increase significantly for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the development of NKTR-214 under the BMS Collaboration Agreement. Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214 in combination with BMS’s Opdivo® (nivolumab) and Opdivo® plus Yervoy® (ipilimumab), with several more registrational studies in additional tumor types and indications planned to begin in 2019.

In addition, we are collaborating with Lilly to develop NKTR-358 and are continuing its Phase 1 clinical development program in 2019. We are continuing to enroll patients in a Phase 1/2 study for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214 in 2019. We plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in 2019 and begin a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in multiple myeloma. We will continue to incur contract manufacturing costs for NKTR-181 and will recognize such costs in research and development expense until NKTR-181 receives regulatory approval, if ever, and we will likely conduct additional development activities for NKTR-181 if NKTR-181 receives regulatory approval. The timing and amount of our future clinical investments will vary significantly based upon our evaluation of ongoing clinical results and the structure, timing, and scope of potential collaboration partnerships (if any) for these programs. In addition, we expect personnel and overhead costs to increase in 2019 due to increases in our employee workforce and facilities costs to support product development, and we also expect non-cash stock-based compensation expense to increase in 2019 due primarily to the increase in our employee workforce.

In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to evaluate in clinical development during 2019 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business. Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our polymer conjugation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas. We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.

Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete. The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:

 • the number of patients required for a given clinical study design;

 • the length of time required to enroll clinical study participants;

 • the number and location of sites included in the clinical studies;

 • the clinical study designs required by the health authorities (i.e. primary and secondary endpoints as well as the size of the study population needed to demonstrate efficacy and safety outcomes);

 • the potential for changing standards of care for the target patient population;

 • the competition for patient recruitment from competitive drug candidates being studied in the same clinical setting;

 • the costs of producing supplies of the drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions;

 • the safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidate;

 • the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials; and

 • the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.

Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for NKTR-214, NKTR-358 and MOVANTIK®. In certain situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.

The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A — Risk Factors. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and

57

completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.

General and administrative expense (in thousands, except percentages)

 Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2018 vs. Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2017 vs.
---------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ----------------------------- - ------ ----------------------------- - ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ------ ---- - ----- ---- -- - -- -
 2018 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
General and administrative expense $ 81,443 $ 52,364 $ 44,275 $ 29,079 $ 8,089 56 % 18 %

General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities. General and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased non-cash stock based compensation expense as well as other costs related to personnel, facilities and outside services. In particular, stock based compensation expense increased by $14.3 million from $13.0 million in 2017 to $27.3 million in 2018. General and administrative expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased costs related to personnel, facilities and outside services. We expect general and administrative expenses in 2019 to increase compared to 2018, due to costs related to personnel, facilities and outside services to support the continued expansion of our business. If NKTR-181 receives regulatory approval, we initially plan to commercialize NKTR-181 through a subsidiary and we expect significant increases in commercialization costs, including sales personnel and related costs to support that separate subsidiary organization.

Impairment of equipment and other costs for terminated program

As described in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2017, Bayer terminated our collaboration to develop Amikacin Inhale. As a result of the termination of the program, in the year ended December 31, 2017, we expensed program-specific manufacturing equipment with a net book value of $15.1 million. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $0.9 million of other program termination costs related to our manufacturing obligations.

Interest expense (in thousands, except percentages)

 2018 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016
Interest expense $ 21,582 $ 22,085 $ 22,468 $ (503 ) $ (383 ) (2 )% (2 )%
Non-cash interest expense on liability related to sale of future royalties $ 21,196 $ 18,869 $ 19,712 $ 2,327 $ (843 ) 12 % (4 )%

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily consists of interest from our senior secured notes which, as further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, were issued in October 2015 for $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount at a rate of 7.75% and which are due in October 2020. Interest on the 7.75% senior secured notes is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360 day year. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 decreased marginally compared with the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to decreased interest expense from our capital leases, which were fully repaid as of December 31, 2017. We expect interest expense in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.

Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the increase to our estimated interest rate. In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® in exchange for $124.0 million. As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser. We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we estimated to be approximately 17% from inception to 2017. During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of CIMZIA®, our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased to approximately 17.6%, which resulted in a prospective interest rate of 21%. During the three month period ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of MIRCERA®, our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement

58

increased to approximately 18.7%, which results in a prospective interest rate of 29%. There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate, in particular, the amount and timing of royalty payments from future net sales of CIMZIA® and MIRCERA®, and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis. As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively. Unless we adjust our estimated interest rate, we expect non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the full year of 2019 to increase compared to 2018 as a result of the increase of the estimated prospective interest rate noted above.

Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased marginally as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the decrease of the average balance of the related liability as that liability balance amortized in 2017.

Income Tax Expense

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded an income tax provision at an effective tax rate of approximately 35% as a result of taxable income at our Nektar India operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of taxable income in India and the U.S. resulting primarily from income recognized from the upfront payment from BMS, we recorded a global income tax provision, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 0.2%. Our tax provision results from taxable income from our Nektar India operations and estimated tax liabilities in certain states where we do not have sufficient net operating losses to offset our estimated apportioned taxable income.

Our income tax expense in the U.S. is based on certain assumptions and other estimates regarding the apportionment of taxable income and the states in which we have nexus in 2018. Our apportionment of taxable income includes estimates of the apportionment of the BMS upfront payment based on estimates of activities to be carried out under the collaboration agreement with BMS, as well as the apportionment of other sources of income. Our income tax expense reflects the release of the valuation allowance of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income. Our remaining deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved, as we believe it is not more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized in the future.

Due to our expected net loss in 2019, we expect income tax expense to decrease compared to 2018 and to reflect an income tax expense for our Nektar India operations at an effective rate of approximately 29%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from upfront and milestone payments under our strategic collaboration agreements, royalties and product sales, as well as public offering and private placements of debt and equity securities. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.9 billion in cash and investments in marketable securities and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes due in October 2020.

We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans through at least March 1, 2020. We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including NKTR-214, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, NKTR-255, NKTR-181, and ONZEALDTM will continue to require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval, as well as for NKTR-181 commercialization activities. In the past, we have received a number of significant payments from collaboration agreements and other significant transactions. In April 2018, we received a total of $1.85 billion from BMS including a $1 billion upfront payment and an $850 million premium investment in our common stock. In July 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement for NKTR-358 with Lilly, under which we received a $150.0 million upfront payment. In the future, we expect to receive substantial payments from our collaboration agreements with BMS and Lilly and other existing and future collaboration transactions if drug candidates in our pipeline achieve positive clinical or regulatory outcomes. In particular, under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to $1.43 billion of regulatory and commercial launch milestones, $650 million of which are associated with approval and launch of NKTR-214 in its first indication in the U.S., EU and Japan.  As a result, whether and when NKTR-214 is approved in any indication will have a significant impact on our future liquidity and capital resources. We have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.

Due to the potential for adverse developments in the credit markets, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities. These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years. However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation. At December 31, 2018, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately eight months. To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities. We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.

59

Our current business plan is subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, clinical and regulatory outcomes for NKTR-214, the sales levels of our products, if and when they are approved, the sales levels for those products for which we are entitled to royalties, clinical program outcomes, whether, when and on what terms we are able to enter into new collaboration transactions, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.

The availability and terms of various financing alternatives, if required in the future, substantially depend on many factors including the success or failure of drug development programs in our pipeline. The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining regulatory authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs, as well as general capital market conditions. We may pursue various financing alternatives to fund the expansion of our business as appropriate.

Cash flows from operating activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $718.2 million, which includes $1,059.8 million of the payments received under the BMS Collaboration Agreement in April 2018 and a $10.0 million milestone payment from our collaboration agreement with Baxalta, partially offset by $332.1 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.5 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes.

Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $80.4 million, which includes $237.8 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.6 million for interest payments on our senior secured, partially offset by the receipt of $150.0 million upfront payment in September 2017 from our collaboration agreement with Lilly for NKTR-358, the receipt of $12.0 million in November 2017 related to our collaboration agreement with Baxalta and the receipt of $15.0 million in December 2017 resulting from a settlement agreement.

Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.0 million, which includes $138.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.7 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $31.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca related to its sub-license to Kirin and the receipt of a $10.0 million milestone in January 2016 from our Baxalta collaboration agreement.

We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront, milestone and other contingent payments received, if any, will increase in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of increased research and development expenses.

Cash flows from investing activities

We paid $14.2 million, $9.7 million, and $6.4 million to purchase property, plant and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For 2018, we also received $2.6 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily from the sale of a former research facility in Huntsville, Alabama. We expect our capital expenditures in 2019 to increase significantly compared to 2018, primarily due to construction of leasehold improvements at our new facilities lease as more fully described in Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements (the Third Street Facility).

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased $1.4 billion of investments in debt securities, net of maturities of investments, primarily as a result of the $1.85 billion received in April 2018 from BMS under the BMS Collaboration Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement.

Cash flows from financing activities

As described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we received $850.0 million for the issuance of our common stock to BMS under our Share Purchase Agreement in April 2018, of which we recorded $790.2 million in equity as a financing activity.

On October 24, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of 14,950,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering with total proceeds of approximately $189.7 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $12.1 million. In addition, we incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.

We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $61.7 million, $59.5 million, and $20.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

The leases are discussed in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our commitment for the Third Street Facility above includes fixed amounts payable for certain costs that we have excluded from our minimum lease payments as disclosed in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3) Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 that were issued under existing contracts. This amount does not represent minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and the results of our operations.

Collaborative Arrangements

When we enter into collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners, we assess whether the arrangements fall within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808) based on whether the arrangements involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, we assess whether the payments between us and our collaboration partner fall within the scope of other accounting literature. If we conclude that payments from the collaboration partner to us represent consideration from a customer, such as license fees and contract research and development activities, we account for those payments within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. However, if we conclude that our collaboration partner is not a customer for certain activities and associated payments, such as for certain collaborative research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, we record such payments as a reduction of research and development expense or general and administrative expense, based on where we record the underlying expense.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize license, collaboration and other research revenue based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes recognition of upfront fees and milestone payments. At the inception of each agreement, we determine which promises represent distinct performance obligations, for which management must use significant judgment. Additionally, at inception and at each reporting date thereafter, we must determine and update, as appropriate, the transaction price, which includes variable consideration such as development milestones. We must use judgment to determine when to include variable consideration in the transaction price such that inclusion of such variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal of revenue recognized when

61

the contingency surrounding the variable consideration is resolved. We must also allocate the arrangement consideration to performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices, which we generally base on our best estimates and which require significant judgment. For example, in estimating the standalone selling prices for granting licenses for our drug candidate, our estimates may include revenue forecasts, clinical development timelines and costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical and regulatory success. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue based on our estimates of expected future costs or other measures of progress.

Clinical Trial Accruals

We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients and completion of certain clinical trial activities. We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases. We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the studies. In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred. Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain. Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified.

Contract Manufacturing Accruals

We record accruals for the estimated costs of our contract manufacturing activities performed by third parties. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors. Payments under the contracts include upfront payments and milestone payments, which depend on factors such as the achievement of the completion of certain stages of the manufacturing process. For purposes of recognizing expense, we assess whether we consider the production process sufficiently defined to be considered the delivery of a good, as evidenced by predictive or contractually required yields, or the delivery of a service, where processes and yields are developing and less certain. If we consider the process to be the delivery of a good, we recognize expense when the drug product is delivered, or we otherwise bear risk of loss. If we consider the process to be the delivery of a service, we recognize expense based on our best estimates of the contract manufacturer’s progress towards completion of the stages in the contract. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain. In certain circumstances, we may be entitled to reductions of amounts due under these arrangements if delivery is delayed or the yield from the production process is lower than expected. Given the uncertainties with such reductions, we may only recognize such decrease when the contract manufacturer agrees with such reduction. Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified.

Stock-Based Compensation

We expense the estimated fair value of each stock award ratably over the expected service period of the award and recognize forfeitures as they occur. For stock options, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for each respective option grant to determine the estimated fair value on the date of grant (grant date fair value). The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management’s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate whether the awards will vest and the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.

Non-cash Interest Expense on Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties

In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively. Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser (RPI) only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate. Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we are required to make to RPI under the agreement. We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources. To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation. There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA® and MIRCERA®, most of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA® and MIRCERA®, all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation. Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation. During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of CIMZIA®, our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased from 17% to approximately 17.6%, which resulted in a prospective interest rate of 21%. During the three month period ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of MIRCERA®, our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased to approximately 18.7%, which results in a prospective interest rate of 29%. If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2018 should have been one percentage point higher than our quarterly estimates during 2018, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 and the Royalty Obligation balance as of December 31, 2018 would have increased by $1.0 million. If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2018 should have been 29% during 2018, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 and the Royalty Obligation balance as of December 31, 2018 would have increased by $6.5 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-18: Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (ASU 2018-18). The guidance clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under ASC 606 when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer for a promised good or service that is distinct within the collaborative arrangement. The guidance also precludes entities from presenting amounts related to transactions with a collaborative arrangement participant that is not a customer as revenue, unless those transactions are directly related to third-party sales. ASU 2018-18 is effective in the first quarter of 2020 and should be applied retrospectively to January 1, 2018, when we adopted ASC 606. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of adoption, but we do not expect a material effect on our revenue.

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The guidance became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our balance sheet. In particular, for our facilities leases described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we expect to recognize right-of-use assets, estimated between $87 million and $97 million, and lease liabilities, estimated between $96 million and $106 million. We will recognize additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as additional space is delivered to us for our Third Street Facility lease

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor.

The results of RB Foods' operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.
