Revenues

-------------- ------------------ ------ -------------- ------ ------ ------ ----------------- - - ------ - ------

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Percentage Change
GBS $ 8,684 $ 9,254 $ (570 ) (6.2)%
GIS 12,069 12,479 (410 ) (3.3)%
Total Revenues $ 20,753 $ 21,733 $ (980 ) (4.5)%

The decrease in revenues for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 reflects an ongoing decline in our traditional application maintenance business and legacy infrastructure services. Fiscal 2019 revenues included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1.6%, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound.

During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows:

For a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.

34

As a global company, approximately 63% of our fiscal 2019 revenues were earned internationally. As a result, the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period is impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency revenues are a non-GAAP measure calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends. The table below summarizes our constant currency revenues:

-------------- -------------------------------- ------ -------------- ------ ------ ------ ----------------- - - ------ - ------

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) Constant Currency March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Percentage Change
GBS $ 8,823 $ 9,254 $ (431 ) (4.7)%
GIS 12,282 12,479 (197 ) (1.6)%
Total Revenues $ 21,105 $ 21,733 $ (628 ) (2.9)%

Global Business Services

Our GBS segment revenues were $8.7 billion for fiscal 2019, representing a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 6.2%, compared to fiscal 2018. The revenue decline included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of $0.1 billion, or 1.5%. GBS revenues in constant currency were $8.8 billion for fiscal 2019, representing a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 4.7%. The decrease in GBS revenue in fiscal 2019 reflects a decline in the traditional application maintenance and management business and includes the impact of accelerated cloud adoption.

Global Infrastructure Services

Our GIS segment revenues were $12.1 billion for fiscal 2019, representing a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 3.3%, compared to fiscal 2018. The revenue decline included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of $0.2 billion, or 1.7%.GIS revenues in constant currency were $12.3 billion for fiscal 2019, representing a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 1.6%. The decrease in GIS revenue in fiscal 2019 reflects the ongoing migration out of legacy infrastructure environments, partially offset by growth in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace offerings.

During fiscal 2019, GBS and GIS had contract awards of $9.3 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, compared with $10.2 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, during fiscal 2018.

Costs and Expenses

Our total costs and expenses were as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ------ ---------------------- ----- ---- ------ ---- - ---- ---- - ---- -

 Fiscal Years Ended Percentage of Revenues
(in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 2019 2018
Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs) $ 14,946 $ 16,317 72.1 % 75.0 %
Selling, general and administrative (excludes depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs) 1,959 1,890 9.4 8.7
Depreciation and amortization 1,968 1,795 9.5 8.3
Restructuring costs 465 789 2.2 3.6
Interest expense, net 206 231 1.0 1.1
Other income, net (306 ) (593 ) (1.5 ) (2.7 )
Total costs and expenses $ 19,238 $ 20,429 92.7 % 94.0 %

35

The 1.3% improvement in costs and expenses, as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2019, reflects continued execution of our synergy initiatives, including workforce optimization, supply chain efficiencies and rationalization of our real estate footprint.

Costs of Services

Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs) ("COS"), was $14.9 billion for fiscal 2019, as compared to $16.3 billion for fiscal 2018. COS decreased $1.4 billion, and as a percentage of revenue decreased 2.9%, compared to fiscal 2018. This decrease was driven by headcount reduction and procurement efficiencies. Employee labor costs, as a percentage of revenue, decreased in both segments and across our geographic regions, year-over-year.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling (general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs) ("SG&A"), was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2019, as compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2018. SG&A increased $0.1 billion, and as a percentage of revenue increased 0.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in SG&A reflects an increase in integration, separation, and transaction-related costs and allocated worldwide support costs.

Integration, separation and transaction-related costs, included in SG&A, were $401 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to $359 million during fiscal 2018.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense ("D&A") was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018. The increase in D&A was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense from leased equipment and an increase in amortization expense related to accelerated transition and transformation contract costs as compared to fiscal 2018.

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization.

During fiscal 2019 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments and geographies. The fiscal 2019 global cost savings initiatives were designed to better align our organizational structure with our strategic initiatives and continue the integration of HPES and other acquisitions.

Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were $465 million and $789 million, respectively. The net amounts recorded included $2 million and $13 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years.

See Note 20 - "Restructuring Costs" for additional information about our restructuring actions.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

Interest expense for fiscal 2019 was $334 million as compared to $320 million in fiscal 2018. Interest income for fiscal 2019 was $128 million, as compared to $89 million in fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase in interest expense and interest income was primarily due to our cash pool arrangements. The increase in cash pool expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to our borrowings.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net includes non-service cost components of net periodic pension income, movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, gain on sale of non-operating assets and other miscellaneous gains and losses.

36

The components of other income, net for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---- -------------- --- - ---- -

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018
Non-service cost components of net periodic pension income $ (182 ) $ (509 )
Foreign currency loss (gain) 31 (71 )
Other gain (155 ) (13 )
Total $ (306 ) $ (593 )

The $287 million decrease in other income for fiscal 2019 was due to a year-over-year decrease of $327 million in non-service components of net periodic pension income and a year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency impact of $102 million resulting primarily from a gain recognized as a result of a change in the functional currency of a European holding company during fiscal 2018, which was not present in the current fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by a $142 million increase in other gains primarily due to sales of non-operating assets during fiscal 2019.

Taxes

Our effective tax rate ("ETR") on income (loss) from continuing operations, before taxes, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 19.0% and (18.6)% respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 11 - "Income Taxes."

In fiscal 2019, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Local tax losses on investments in Luxembourg that decreased the foreign tax rate differential and decreased the ETR by $360 million and 23.7%, respectively, with an offsetting increase in the ETR due to an increase in the valuation allowance of the same amount.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A change in the net valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, primarily in Luxembourg, Germany, Spain, UK, and Switzerland, which increased income tax expense and increased the ETR by $256 million and 16.9%, respectively.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A decrease in the transition tax liability and a change in tax accounting method for deferred revenue, which decreased income tax expense and decreased the ETR by $66 million and 4.3%, respectively.

In fiscal 2018, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Due to the Company's change in repatriation policy, the reversal of a deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $554 million and 42.5%, respectively.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The accrual of the one-time transition tax on estimated unremitted foreign earnings, which decreased the income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $361 million and 27.7%, respectively.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $338 million and 25.9%, respectively.

As of March 31, 2018, our net deferred tax assets in certain DXC German entities were primarily the result of net operating loss carryforwards, pension, restructuring, and other miscellaneous accruals. A full valuation allowance was recorded against these net deferred tax assets as of that reporting date. For the period ended December 31, 2018 management determined that the positive evidence, including the duration of the current profitability due to realization of cost synergies relating to the HPES merger, a legal entity restructuring allowing the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the nonrecurring nature of the factors that primarily drove historical losses outweighs the negative evidence of a three-year cumulative loss. Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, management had a change in judgment and concluded that it is now more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in these DXC German entities will be fully utilized. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance release of $113 million. As of March 31, 2019, management had no change in our conclusions regarding the positive and negative evidence and future realizability of these DXC German entities' deferred tax assets.

The IRS is examining CSC's federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2017. With respect to CSC's fiscal 2008 through 2010 federal tax returns, we previously entered into negotiations for a resolution through settlement with the IRS

37

Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. We have an agreement in principle with the IRS Office of Appeals as to some but not all of these adjustments. We have agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through November 30, 2019. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report with proposed adjustments to CSC's fiscal 2011 through 2013 federal returns. We have filed a protest of certain of these adjustments to the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS is also examining CSC's fiscal 2014 through 2017 federal income tax returns. We have not received any proposed adjustments for this cycle. We continue to believe that our tax positions are more likely than not sustainable and that we will ultimately prevail. The Company now expects to reach a resolution for all years no earlier than fiscal 2021.

In addition, we may settle certain other tax examinations, have lapses in statutes of limitations, or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions. We may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a more likely than not standard if such positions are not upheld. Conversely, we could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through payment. We believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of $9 million, excluding interest, penalties, and tax carryforwards.

Income from Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations reflects the net income generated by USPS. As the Separation occurred on May 31, 2018, there are only two months of USPS results included in fiscal 2019.

Earnings Per Share

Diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 was $4.35, a decrease of $0.88 per share compared with the prior fiscal year. The EPS decrease was due to a decrease of $319 million in income from continuing operations.

Diluted EPS for fiscal 2019 includes $1.25 per share of restructuring costs, $1.06 per share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, $1.42 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets, $0.41 per share of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses and $(0.16) per share of tax adjustment related to U.S. tax reform.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present non-GAAP financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of DXC. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, constant currency revenues and net debt-to-total capitalization.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results which DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the financial performance of DXC exclusive of the impacts of corporate-wide strategic decisions. DXC management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC, as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS targets.

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.

Adjusted EBIT $ 3,269 $ 2,989 $ 280 9.4 %

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP adjustments include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring - reflects costs, net of reversals, related to workforce optimization and real estate charges.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Transaction, separation and integration-related costs - reflects costs related to integration planning, financing and advisory fees associated with the HPES Merger and other acquisitions and costs related to the separation of USPS.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization of acquired intangible assets - reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses - reflects pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax adjustment - reflects the estimated non-recurring benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for fiscal 2019 and the application of an approximate 28% tax rate for fiscal 2018, which is within the targeted effective tax rate range for the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows

As of March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents ("cash") were $2.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was held outside of the United States. A substantial portion of funds can be returned to the U.S. from funds advanced previously to finance our foreign acquisition initiatives. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and after the mandatory one-time income inclusion (deemed repatriation) of the historically untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and current income inclusions for global intangible low taxed income, we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax consequences upon subsequent repatriation to the U.S. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax consequences upon future remittance. Therefore, if additional funds held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the U.S. we plan to repatriate these funds.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $0.3 billion during fiscal 2018 to $2.9 billion, primarily due to changes in operating activities. The cash flows of USPS have not been segregated and are included in the statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and through the separation date of May 31, 2018 in the statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 was $1,783 million as compared to $2,567 million during fiscal 2018. The decrease of $784 million was predominately due to a decrease in net income of $520 million, a change in net accounts receivables of $483 million, and other working capital. This was partially offset by additional deferred tax adjustments of $939 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was $2,567 million as compared to $619 million during fiscal 2017. The increase of $1,948 million was predominately due to an increase in net income of $1,882 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was partially offset by additional deferred tax adjustments to operating activities of $842 million and an increase in the gain on pension and other post-employment benefits of $307 million.

Investing cash flow

Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 decreased $650 million to $69 million. The decrease was due to net cash provided by acquisitions of $735 million during fiscal 2018, compared with cash paid for acquisitions of $365 million during fiscal 2019. In addition, there was an increase in cash payments for outsourcing contract costs of $66 million, software purchases of $50 million and purchase of property and equipment of $73 million. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was offset by additional proceeds from sale of assets of $299 million and cash collections from deferred purchase price receivables of $399 million.

42

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities during fiscal 2018 was $719 million as compared to $(565) million for fiscal 2017. The increase was predominantly due to net cash provided by acquisitions of $735 million during fiscal 2018, compared with cash paid for acquisitions of $434 million during fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash payments for outsourcing contract costs of $227 million and software purchases of $71 million.

Financing cash flow

Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2019 was $1,663 million, as compared to $1,890 million during fiscal 2018. The $227 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments of $737 million in fiscal 2018, which did not recur in the current year, additional draws on long-term debt of $1,025 million, and borrowings of $1,114 million for the USPS Separation. This was partially offset by additional payments on long-term debt obligations of $1,078 million, repurchases of common stock of $1,212 million, and a decrease in cash proceeds from bond issuance of $236 million.

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was $(1,890) million, as compared to $93 million during fiscal 2017. The $1,983 million increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in credit facility draws, net of repayments of $868 million, additional payments on capitalized lease obligations of $915 million, additional payments on long-term debt obligations of $1,379 million and $132 million in payments for repurchases of common stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by draws on long-term debt of $462 million and cash proceeds from bond issuance of $989 million.

Capital Resources

See Note 21 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below and under the subheading "Liquidity."

The following table summarizes out total debt:

-------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ----- -------------- ----- - -----

 As of
(in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018
Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 1,942 $ 1,918
Long-term debt, net of current maturities 5,470 6,092
Total debt $ 7,412 $ 8,010

The $0.6 billion decrease in total debt during fiscal 2019 was primarily attributed to the repayment of $899 million principal amount of the USD term loan due 2022. This debt repayment was financed from the cash payment received from Perspecta in connection with the Separation.

During fiscal 2019, we completed a senior note offering in an aggregate principal of €650 million due 2026 and entered into term loan credit agreements in aggregate principal amounts of £450 million maturing in fiscal 2022 and AUD 800 million maturing in fiscal 2021. The proceeds of these credit facilities were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. Also, we amended our commercial paper program to issue short-term commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of €1 billion or its equivalent in U.S. dollars.

Additionally, during fiscal 2019, we entered into a term loan credit agreement consisting of three tranches (the "delayed draw term loan"): (i) $500 million maturing five years following the funding date; (ii) €750 million maturing two years following the funding date; and (iii) €750 million maturing three years following the funding date. The proceeds of this term loan will be used to finance in part the acquisition of Luxoft and for general corporate purposes. The term loan is undrawn as of March 31, 2019.

43

We were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.

The maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of long-term debt principal for fiscal years subsequent to March 31, 2019 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under long-term financing and capitalized lease liabilities. For more information on our debt, see Note 12 - "Debt" to the financial statements.

The following table summarizes our capitalization ratios:

(1) Net debt and Net debt-to-total capitalization are non-GAAP measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone.

44

The decrease in net debt-to-total capitalization was due to a $0.9 billion decrease in net debt, attributed to a $0.6 billion decrease in total debt. The decrease in net debt was partially offset by a $2.1 billion decrease in equity resulting primarily from the Separation of USPS and share repurchases.

As of March 31, 2019, our credit ratings were as follows:

------------- ------ ------- ------------------

Rating Agency Rating Outlook Short Term Ratings
Fitch BBB+ Stable F-2
Moody's Baa2 Stable P-2
S&P BBB Stable -

Subsequent to the January 2019 announcement by DXC and Luxoft of a definitive agreement for DXC to acquire Luxoft, Fitch, Moody's and S&P affirmed their ratings and outlook for DXC.

See Note 21 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below.

Liquidity

We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to draw on our multi-currency revolving credit facility or raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans, and bonds. In addition, we currently utilize, and will further utilize, our cross currency cash pool for liquidity needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.

Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.

The following table summarizes our total liquidity:

-------------------------------------------------------- -------------- -----

 As of
(in millions) March 31, 2019
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,899
Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 4,000
Available borrowings under our delayed draw term loan 2,185
Total liquidity $ 9,084

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock and on November 8, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an incremental $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. An expiration date has not been established for this repurchase plan. During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 19,342,586 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,339 million.

Dividends

During fiscal 2019, our Board of Directors declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of $0.76 per share, or approximately $209 million. Future dividends are subject to customary board review and approval prior to declaration.

45

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note 5 - "Receivables" and Note 21 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019, were as follows:

------------------------------------------- ---------------- ----- --------- ----- --------- ----- ---------------- ----- ----- ----- ----- - ------

(1) Amounts represent scheduled principal payments of long-term debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary.
(2) Includes long-term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers and exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. If we do not meet the specified service minimums, we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall.
(3) The transition tax, which has now been determined to be complete, resulted in recording a total transition tax obligation of $316 million, of which $324 million was recorded as income tax liability and $(8) million recorded as a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits, which has been omitted from this table. The transition tax is payable over eight years; 8% of net tax liability in each of years 1-5, 15% in year 6, 20% in year 7, and 25% in year 8. We have made our first payment. See Note 11 - "Income Taxes" for additional information about the transition tax.
(4) Amounts represent scheduled interest payments on long-term debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features.
(5) See Note 13 - "Pension and Other Benefit Plans" for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our Pension and OPEB plans that have been omitted from this table.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in accordance with GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them: revenue recognition, income taxes, business combinations, defined benefit plans and valuation of assets. We have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.

Revenue Recognition

Most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time. However, some arrangements may require significant estimates, including contracts which include multiple performance obligations.

46

Contracts with Multiple performance obligations

Many of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers, which may include a combination of services, products or both. As a result, significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes, and, when considered appropriate, how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition for each. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. Certain of our contracts involve the sale of DXC proprietary software, post contract customer support and other software-related services. The standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately. In certain limited cases (typically for software licenses) when the historical selling price is highly variable, the residual approach is used. This approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations. These methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entity-specific factors, such as type of customer, features of the products or services and market conditions.

Once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations, revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each. Estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception.

Costs to obtain contracts with customers

Accounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period. Most of our sales commission plans are quota-based and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts. Certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We defer and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over an average period of benefit of five years, which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period, or if there are material changes in the average contract period.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, analyzing our income tax reserves, the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances. In addition, our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.

As a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, the extent to which our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, changes in tax regulations, acquisitions, dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income. We cannot predict what our ETR will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors.

47

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, we changed our ASC 740-30 assertion with respect to the remaining CSC foreign subsidiaries and no longer consider current and accumulated earnings for all non-U.S. subsidiaries permanently reinvested, except for current year Indian earnings. The $554 million deferred tax liability relating to HPES foreign subsidiaries was released and the $46 million liability for the India dividend distribution tax was reversed in the current period as the Company changed its reinvestment assertion relating to certain India earnings due to a change in cash requirements of the U.S. parent and India.

Considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets. However, valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors.

Changes in tax laws, such as the Act or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations. As discussed in Note 11 - "Income Taxes", for example, the Act provides provisions that limit interest expense, provide for immediate expensing of qualified assets, further limits executive compensation deductions, generally eliminates Federal tax on foreign dividend distributions, subjects certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties to additional taxes, places restrictions or eliminates certain exclusions, deductions and credits and generally broadens the tax base. Further guidance for these provisions is forthcoming and the laws are subject to change in future periods.

Business Combinations

We account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.

Defined Benefit Plans

The computation of our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. Inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates. Our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary. The fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate.

48

Our weighted average rates used were:

-------------------------------------------- -------------- - -------------- --- -------------- --- -

 March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017
Discount rates 2.5 % 2.5 % 3.1 %
Expected long-term rates of return on assets 5.3 % 4.9 % 6.3 %

The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan; judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses. The discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period. The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2019:

---------------------------------------- ------ -------------------------------------------------- --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ----- -

(in millions) Change Approximate Change in Net Periodic Pension Expense Approximate Change in Settlement, Contractual Termination, and Mark-to-Market Charges
Expected long-term return on plan assets 0.5% $ (54 ) $ 53
Expected long-term return on plan assets (0.5)% $ 54 $ (53 )

Discount rate 0.5% $ 19 $ (898 )
Discount rate (0.5)% $ (24 ) $ 1,138

Valuation of Assets

We review long-lived ("assets, intangible assets, and goodwill") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts.

Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. The discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business-specific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows.

Revenues

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Percentage Change
GBS $ 8,684 $ 9,254 $ (570 ) (6.2)%
GIS 12,069 12,479 (410 ) (3.3)%
Total Revenues $ 20,753 $ 21,733 $ (980 ) (4.5)%

The decrease in revenues for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 reflects an ongoing decline in our traditional application maintenance business and legacy infrastructure services. Fiscal 2019 revenues included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1.6%, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound.

During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows:

For a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A "]:
Item 1A. Risk Factors 8

[" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below.

Liquidity

We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to draw on our multi-currency revolving credit facility or raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans, and bonds. In addition, we currently utilize, and will further utilize, our cross currency cash pool for liquidity needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.

Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.

The following table summarizes our total liquidity:

-------------------------------------------------------- -------------- -----

 As of
(in millions) March 31, 2019
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,899
Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 4,000
Available borrowings under our delayed draw term loan 2,185
Total liquidity $ 9,084

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the date has not been established for this repurchase plan. During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 19,342,586 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,339 million.

Dividends

During fiscal 2019, our Board of Directors declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of $0.76 per share, or approximately $209 million. Future dividends are subject to customary board review and approval prior to declaration.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note 5 - "]:

[") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates 

 estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit']:
(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...
