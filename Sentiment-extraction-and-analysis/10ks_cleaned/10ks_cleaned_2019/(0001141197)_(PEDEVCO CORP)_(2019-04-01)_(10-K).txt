ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains
“forward-looking
statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates,
beliefs and expected performance. We caution you that assumptions,
expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the
differences can be material. See “Risk Factors” and
“Forward Looking
Statements.”

Overview

We are an oil and gas company focused on the
development, acquisition and production of oil and natural
gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and
completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. In
particular, we focus on legacy proven properties where there is a
long production history, well defined geology and existing
infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field
management technologies. Our current properties are located in the
San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas
and eastern New Mexico and in the
Denver-Julesberg Basin in Colorado.  As of December 31, 2018,
we held approximately 23,441 net Permian Basin acres located in
Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, through PEDCO and
approximately 11,948 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan
Counties, Colorado, through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary,
Red Hawk. As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in 337 gross
(337 net) wells in our Permian Basin Asset of which 51 are active
producers, 18 are active injectors and one well is an active SWD,
all of which are held by PEDCO and operated by its wholly-owned
operating subsidiaries, and interests in 69 gross (21.5 net) wells
in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 18 gross (16.2 net) wells are
operated by Red Hawk and currently producing, 29 gross (5.2 net)
wells are non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout
interest.

Detailed
information about our business plans and operations, including our
core D-J Basin and Permian Basin Assets, is contained under
“Part
1” — “Item 1 and 2. Business and
Properties” above.

How We Conduct Our Business and Evaluate Our
Operations

Our use
of capital for acquisitions and development allows us to direct our
capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive
opportunities as market conditions evolve. We have historically
acquired properties that we believe had significant appreciation
potential. We intend to continue to acquire both operated and
non-operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our
return objectives.

65

We will
use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the
performance of our oil and natural gas operations,
including:

●

production
volumes;

●

realized
prices on the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effects of
our commodity derivative contracts;

●

oil
and natural gas production and operating expenses;

●

capital
expenditures;

●

general
and administrative expenses;

●

net
cash provided by operating activities; and

●

net
income.

Reserves

Our
estimated net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at December
31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 12.4 million Boe and 3.7
million Boe, respectively. This reserve level increased
approximately 8.7 million Boe or 244%, from 2017 to 2018. In 2018,
we had a significant increase in reserves primarily due to our
acquisition of the Permian Basin Assets in September
2018.

Using the average monthly crude oil price of
$59.22 per Bbl and natural gas price of $1.56 per thousand cubic
feet (Mcf) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our
estimated discounted future net cash flow (PV-10) before tax
expenses for our proved reserves was approximately $181.3 million,
of which approximately $173.3 million are proved undeveloped
reserves. Total reserve value at December 31, 2018 represents an
increase of approximately $150.0 million or 48% from a year earlier
using the same SEC pricing and reserves methodology. The
significant increase can be attributed to our acquisition noted
above, which represents over 95% of our total reserves as of
December 31, 2018. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are market
driven and have been historically volatile, and we expect that
future prices will continue to fluctuate due to supply and demand
factors, seasonality, and geopolitical and economic factors, and
such volatility can have a significant impact on our estimates of
proved reserves and the related PV-10 value.

The
reserves as of December 31, 2018 were determined in accordance with
standard industry practices and SEC regulations by the licensed
independent petroleum engineering firm of Cawley, Gillespie &
Associates, Inc. A large portion of the proved undeveloped crude
oil reserves are associated with the Permian Basin formation.
Although these hydrocarbon quantities have been determined in
accordance with industry standards, they are prepared using the
subjective judgments of the independent engineers, and may actually
be more or less.

Oil and Natural Gas Sales Volumes

During
the year ended December 31, 2018, our net crude oil and natural
sales volumes increased to 92,985 Bbls or 255 Bopd from 81,178
Bbls, or 222 Bopd, a 15% increase over the previous fiscal year.
The production increase is primarily related to the Company’
acquisition of oil and gas properties in third quarter of
2018.

Significant Capital Expenditures

The
table below sets out the significant components of capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no
other significant expenditures in 2017 (in thousands):

 2018
--------------------------- -------
Capital Expenditures
Leasehold Acquisitions (1) $18,849
Property Acquisitions (1) 2,181
Drilling and Facilities (1) 8,933
Other (2) 1,928
Total $31,891

(1)

Consists of amounts primarily related to the New
Mexico and Condor property acquisitions (discussed in greater
detail at “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” - “Note 6 - Oil and Gas
Properties.”)

(2)

Other non-cash acquisitions relate to the
present value of the estimated asset retirement costs capitalized
as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset.

66

Market Conditions and Commodity Prices

Our
financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of
natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production
on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by
many factors outside of our control, including changes in market
supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions,
inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As
a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and,
therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what
effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our
production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes
and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of
natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical
to our long-term success. We expect prices to remain volatile for
the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of
realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and
condensate revenues, refer to “Results of Operations”
below.

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the
results of operations for each of the two fiscal years in the
period ended December 31, 2018 should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements of PEDEVCO Corp. and notes
thereto included herein (see “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data”).

We
reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $53.6
million, or $4.80 per share, compared to net loss for the year
ended December 31, 2017 of $36.4 million or ($6.22) per share. The
increase in net income was primarily due to the recognition of
$70.3 million in gain on debt restructuring in 2018, and the
effects of a $19.0 million impairment of our oil and gas properties
in 2017. Excluding these two significant transactions, our net loss
would have decreased by $0.7 million, mainly as result of a
decrease of $5.1 million in interest expense incurred prior to our
debt restructuring, offset by a decrease in our operating margin of
$4.4 million, as a result of additional well and depletion costs
from our acquisitions, when comparing the current period to the
prior period.

Net Revenues

The
following table sets forth the revenue and
production data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2017:

 %
-------------------------------------- ------ ------- ------------------- -------------------
 2018 2017 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease)
Sale Volumes:
Crude Oil (Bbls) 70,395 52,260 18,135 35%
Natural Gas (Mcf) 89,769 100,254 (10,485) (10%)
NGL (Mcf) 45,774 73,254 (27,480) (38%)
Total (Boe) 92,985 81,178 11,807 15%

Crude Oil (Bbls per day) 193 143 50 35%
Natural Gas (Mcf per day) 246 275 (29) (11%)
NGL (Mcf per day) 125 201 (76) (38%)
Total (Boe per day) 255 222 33 15%

Average Sale Price:
Crude Oil ($/Bbl) $59.00 $47.15 $11.85 25%
Natural Gas($/Mcf) 2.56 2.97 (0.41) (14%)

Natural Gas 230 298 (68) (23%)
NGL 140 253 (113) (45%)
Total Revenues $4,523 $3,015 $1,508 50%

(1) Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas and NGL equivalents to 1 barrel of oil.

67

Total crude oil and natural gas revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.5 million, or 50%, to
$4.5 million, compared to $3.0 million for the same period a year
ago due primarily to a favorable crude oil volume variance of
$0.9 million coupled with a favorable crude oil price
variance of 0.6 million. The production increase can be attributed
to the Company’s acquisition of additional oil and gas
properties in the late third quarter of 2018 (discussed in greater detail at
“Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” -
“Note 6 - Oil and
Gas Properties”).

Net Operating and Other (Income) Expenses

The
following table sets forth operating and other expenses
for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (In
thousands):

 %
---------------------------------------- --------- ------- ------------------- -------------------
 2018 2017 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease)

Lease Operating Expenses $2,821 $1,348 $1,473 109%
Exploration Expenses 47 2 45 2,250%
Depreciation, Depletion,
Amortization and Accretion 6,519 3,754 2,765 74%
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties - 18,950 (18,950) (100%)

General and Administrative (Cash) $3,278 $1,874 $1,404 75%
Share-Based Compensation (Non-Cash) 862 655 207 32%
Total General and Administrative Expense 4,140 $2,529 $1,611 64%

Interest Expense $7,699 $12,798 $(5,099) (40%)
Gain on Debt Extinguishment $(70,309) $- $(70,309) 100%

Lease Operating
Expenses. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily due to
workover expenses and somewhat higher variable lease operating
expenses associated with the higher oil volume resulting from the
increased number of wells and increased oil production during 2018,
compared to 2017 due to the Permian Asset acquisition.

Exploration
Expense.  The increase of
$45,000 was due to a small increase in exploration activity
undertaken by the Company in the current year, compared to the
prior year.

Depreciation, Depletion,
Amortization and Accretion (“DD&A”).
The $2.8 million increase was primarily the result of higher oil
volume resulting from the increased number of wells and increased
oil production from our 2018 property acquisitions, compared to
2017.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties.
In 2017, the Company recognized an impairment of $19.0 million for
its oil and gas properties resulting from a delay in the funding
necessary to support the capital expenditures used in the reserve
report for development of the proven undeveloped acreage. No such
impairment charge was recorded during 2018.

General and Administrative
Expenses (“G&A”)
(excluding share-based compensation). The increase of $1.4
million was primarily due to increases in payroll, including
$350,000 in severance costs, as well as other cost increases
resulting from the hiring of additional personnel and consultants
for fiscal year 2018, compared to 2017.

Share-Based
Compensation. Share-based
compensation, which is included in general and administrative
expenses in the Statements of Operations, increased approximately
32%, primarily due to an increase in the awarding of employee
stock-based options and compensation. Share-based compensation is
utilized for the purpose of conserving cash resources for use in
field development activities and operations.

Interest Expense.  The decrease of $5.1 million was
due primarily to lower loan balances compared to the prior
year’s period as a result of the Company’s June 2018
debt restructuring.

68

Gain on Debt Extinguishment.
The Company recognized a gain of $70.3
million on the Company’s debt restructuring, which occurred
in June 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary sources of cash for the Company during
the year ended December 31, 2018 were funds borrowed
pursuant to promissory notes (the majority of which were
convertible into common stock), the majority of which funds came
from SK Energy, which is owned and controlled by Dr. Kukes, our
Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, and
sales of crude oil and natural gas. The primary uses of cash were
funds used for acquisitions and development costs and operations.
Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the primary sources of the
Company’s cash have been sales of crude oil and an additional
borrowing.

Working Capital

At
December 31, 2018, the Company’s total current liabilities of
$8.9 million exceeded its total current assets of $6.8 million,
resulting in a working capital deficit of $2.1 million, while at
December 31, 2017, the Company’s total current liabilities of
$3.4 million exceeded its total current assets of $1.4 million,
resulting in a working capital deficit of $2.0 million. The $0.1
million increase in the working capital deficit is primarily
related to increases in current liabilities as of December 31,
2018, due to cash borrowed under our convertible notes in excess of
amounts used for our oil and gas property acquisitions of
approximately $10.7 million, offset by a $4.9 million increase in
our cash balance (including restricted cash of $2.3 million) and a
$5.7 million increase in payables and accrued expenses related to
our capital drilling projects.

At The Market Offering

On
September 29, 2016, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales
Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with
National Securities Corporation (“NSC”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of National Holdings Corporation (NasdaqCM:NHLD),
pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its
common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to
$2,000,000 (the “Shares”) from time to
time, as the Company deems prudent, through NSC (the
“Offering”). Upon delivery
of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of
the Sales Agreement, NSC may sell the Shares by methods deemed to
be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415
promulgated under the Securities Act.

With
the Company’s prior written approval, NSC may also sell the
Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in
negotiated transactions. The Company may elect not to issue and
sell any Shares in the Offering and the Company or NSC may suspend
or terminate the offering of Shares upon notice to the other party
and subject to other conditions. NSC will act as sales agent on a
commercially reasonable efforts basis consistent with its normal
trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal law,
rules and regulations and the rules of the NYSE
American.

The
Company has agreed to pay NSC commissions for its services in
acting as agent in the sale of the Shares in the amount equal to
3.0% of the gross sales price of all Shares sold pursuant to the
Agreement. The Company also paid
various expenses in connection with the offering, including
reimbursing $30,000 of NSC’s legal fees, which has been paid
to date. The Company has also agreed to provide NSC with customary
indemnification and contribution rights.

The
Company has used, and intends to use, the net proceeds from the
offering to fund development and for working capital and general
corporate purposes, including general and administrative purposes.
The Company is not obligated to make any sales of common stock
under the Sales Agreement, and no assurance can be given that the
Company will sell any additional shares under the Sales Agreement
(other than as described below), or, if it does, as to the price or
amount of Shares that it will sell, or the dates on which any such
sales will take place.

The
Company has filed a final prospectus in connection with such
offering with the SEC (as part of the Form S-3 registration
statement). To date, we have sold an aggregate of 590,335 shares of
common stock under the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement and the
associated prospectus at prices ranging from $0.90 to $1.12 per
share for an aggregate purchase price of $641,000, to which an
underwriter’s fee of 3.0% was applied, leaving approximately
$1.36 million remaining available for issuance thereunder, subject
to limitation under the SEC’s “Baby Shelf
Rules”.

69

We
currently have no plans to sell any additional shares under the
Sales Agreement.

Cash Flows (in thousands)

 Year Ended December 31,
------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------
 2018 2017
Cash flows used in operating activities $(1,494) $(236)
Cash flows used in investing activities (23,118) -
Cash flows provided by financing activities 29,474 494
Net increase in cash and restricted cash $4,862 $258

Cash Flows used in Operating
Activities. We had net cash used in operating
activities of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
which was an increase of $1.3 million as compared to the prior year
period of $0.2 million. This increase was primarily due to a $90.0
million increase in net income as a result of a $70.3 million gain
from our debt restructuring in the current year, which also
resulted in $5.0 million less in capitalized debt interest and
amortized discounts. There was also a $19 million impairment to oil
and gas properties in the prior year, while no impairment was
recognized in the current year.

Cash Flows used in Investing
Activities. We had net cash used by investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $23.1 million,
primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of oil and gas
properties and drilling activities, compared to none for the prior
year’s period.

Cash Flows provided by Financing
Activities. We had net cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $29.5 million,
compared to $0.5 million for the prior year’s period. The
cash provided in the current year consisted primarily of proceeds
from notes that were issued, offset by the repayment of notes
payable in connection with our debt restructuring, while the cash
provided for the previous year was due to proceeds realized from
the sale of common stock.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The
Company does not participate in financial transactions that
generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in
preparation of our financial statements.

Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts
Method. The successful efforts method of accounting is
used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under
this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and
facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties
are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when
incurred. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration
and evaluation assets pending determination of whether the wells
find proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are
the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and
costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include
consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions.

70

Exploratory wells
in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for
economic viability within one year of completion of drilling. The
related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is determined
that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise, the
related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties and
subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are found
to have economically viable reserves in areas where major capital
expenditure will be required before production can commence, the
related well costs remain capitalized only if additional drilling
is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise the related well costs
are expensed as dry holes.

Exploration and
evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition of
an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for in
accordance with the policy outlined above.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is
calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production
method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total
estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other
capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
Costs specific to developmental wells
for which drilling is in progress or uncompleted are
capitalized as wells in progress and not subject to amortization
until completion and production commences, at which time
amortization on the basis of production will begin.

Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606)”, supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements and industry-specific guidance under
Revenue Recognition (Topic
605). Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when
it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled
to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted
Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective
method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January
1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method, prior period
financial positions and results will not be adjusted. The
cumulative effect adjustment recognized in the opening balances
included no significant changes as a result of this adoption. While
the Company does not expect 2018 net earnings to be materially
impacted by revenue recognition timing changes, Topic 606 requires
certain changes to the presentation of revenues and related
expenses beginning January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 5 – Revenue
from Contracts with Customers for additional
information.

The
Company’s revenue is comprised entirely of revenue from
exploration and production activities. The Company’s oil is
sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas
is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas
pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution
companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to
direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally
received from the customer in the month following
delivery.

Contracts with
customers have varying terms, including month-to-month contracts,
and contracts with a finite term. The Company recognizes sales
revenues for oil, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each
product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer.
Generally, control transfers at the time of delivery to the
customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing
facility, or as a tanker lifting is completed. Revenue is measured
based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and
may include adjustments for market differentials and downstream
costs incurred by the customer, including gathering,
transportation, and fuel costs.

Revenues are
recognized for the sale of the Company’s net share of
production volumes. Sales on behalf of other working interest
owners and royalty interest owners are not recognized as
revenues.

Stock-Based Compensation. Pursuant
to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation, which establishes
accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service,
we utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock option awards at the date of grant,
which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these
inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of
estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These
assumptions are subjective and generally require significant
analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some
of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external
data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical
experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate
weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment,
based on relevant facts and circumstances. We estimate volatility
by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use
the simplified method for estimating expected term, which is equal
to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual
term.
