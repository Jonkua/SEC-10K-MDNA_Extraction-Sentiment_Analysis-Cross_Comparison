ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.

MANAGEMENT’S OVERVIEW

Summary of 2018

During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 97.5%. See below for the results of our two business segments and details of operating activity of our O&M portfolio.

In 2018, we completed the following significant activities as further described in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

• On August 22, 2018, we completed the DCT Transaction for $8.5 billion through the issuance of $6.6 billion of equity and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt. In the third quarter, we repaid $1.8 billion of the assumed debt using the proceeds from the debt issuances discussed below. See Notes 3 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this transaction.

• We issued the following senior notes, primarily for the refinancing of the assumed DCT debt, as discussed above, as well as for general corporate purposes, including the repayment or repurchase of other indebtedness:

 o In January, we issued €400 million ($494 million) of senior notes bearing a floating rate of Euribor plus 0.3%, maturing in January 2020.

22

 o In June, we issued $700 million of senior notes that bear interest rates ranging from 3.9% to 4.4%, maturing from September 2028 through 2048.

 o In July, we issued €700 million ($819 million) of senior notes that bear an interest rate of 1.9% and mature in January 2029.

 o In September, we issued ¥55 billion ($489 million) of senior notes that bear interest rates ranging from 0.7% to 1.5%, maturing from September 2025 through 2038.

This debt activity resulted in extending our debt maturities to 76 months and lowering our effective interest rate to 2.7%, both on a weighted-average basis.

• We generated net proceeds of $2.8 billion and realized net gains of $841 million from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally in Europe and Japan, and the disposition of non-strategic operating properties, principally in Europe and the U.S. With these dispositions, we completed our O&M disposition program of non-strategic assets that began in 2011. Through this program we generated approximately $14 billion in proceeds resulting in our O&M operating portfolio being focused on the highest-quality properties in the best markets.

• We earned promotes aggregating $118 million in Strategic Capital Revenues ($80 million net of related expenses), principally from the Prologis China Logistics Venture and PELP.

In January 2019, we formed PBLV, a Brazilian unconsolidated co-investment venture, with one partner. We contributed an initial portfolio of real estate properties to PBLV consisting of 14 operating properties totaling 7 million square feet and 371 acres of land. We received cash proceeds and units for our 20% equity interest.

We ended 2018 with vacancies at historic lows, strong customer and investor demand, leases signed with record long terms and a strong balance sheet. We have seen no signs of slowness based on our operating metrics and remain positive on our outlook. However, given the current market volatility caused by current trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, we will continue to be prudent in running our business.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our core operations.

Below is a reconciliation of our NOI by segment to Operating Income per the Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions). Each segment’s NOI is reconciled to a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the respective segment discussion below.

 2018 2017 2016
-------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- - ----- ---- - ----- -
Real Estate Operations – NOI $ 1,784 $ 1,662 $ 1,646
Strategic Capital – NOI 249 219 175
General and administrative expenses (239 ) (231 ) (222 )
Depreciation and amortization expenses (947 ) (879 ) (931 )
Operating income $ 847 $ 771 $ 668

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s NOI to Operating Income and Earnings Before Income Taxes.

Real Estate Operations

This operating segment principally includes rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Real Estate Operations segment through Rental Expenses and the Strategic Capital segment through Strategic Capital Expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents, kept occupancies high and fueled development activity. In addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.

23

Below are the components of Real Estate Operations revenues, expenses and NOI (in millions), derived directly from line items in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 2018 2017 2016
----------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- - ----- ---- - ----- -
Rental revenues $ 1,859 $ 1,738 $ 1,735
Rental recoveries 530 487 486
Development management and other revenues 9 19 8
Rental expenses (601 ) (570 ) (569 )
Other expenses (13 ) (12 ) (14 )
Real Estate Operations – NOI $ 1,784 $ 1,662 $ 1,646

The change in Real Estate Operations NOI during these periods was impacted by the following items (dollars in millions):

(1) Acquisition activity increased NOI from this segment in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the DCT Transaction on August 22, 2018.

(2) During these periods, we experienced increased occupancy and positive rent rate growth. Rent rate growth (or rent change) is a combination of the rollover of existing leases and increases in certain rental rates from contractual rent increases on existing leases. If a lease has a contractual rent increase that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore, impacts the rental revenues we recognize. See below for key metrics on occupancy and rent change on rollover for the consolidated operating portfolio.

(3) We calculate changes in NOI from development completions period over period by comparing the change in NOI generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018 for the period 2018 from 2017 and on or after January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 for the period 2017 from 2016.

(4) Included in contribution and disposition activity for both periods was the contribution of the Prologis North American Industrial Fund (“NAIF”) operating properties to USLF in July 2017.

(5) Other items include property tax expense recoveries, noncash adjustments for the amortization of above or below market leases, non-recoverable expenses and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio. Beginning January 1, 2018, we modified certain definitions of our operating metrics to align methodologies with members of the industrial REIT group. These changes were retroactively applied for all prior periods presented.

24

(1) In August 2018, we completed the DCT Transaction and acquired a portfolio of logistics real estate assets.

(2) Consolidated square feet of leases commenced and weighted average rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater.

Development Start Activity

The following table summarizes consolidated development starts (dollars and square feet in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- - ----- ---- - ----- -
Number of new development projects during the period 67 74 73
Square feet 26 25 22
TEI $ 2,408 $ 2,261 $ 1,754
Percentage of build-to-suits based on TEI 40.8 % 48.5 % 42.2 %

Development Stabilization Activity

The following table summarizes consolidated development stabilization activity (dollars and square feet in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
----------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---- - ----- ---- - ----- -
Number of development projects stabilized during the period 60 76 75
Square feet 21 24 27
TEI $ 1,824 $ 1,949 $ 2,178
Weighted average stabilized yield (1) 6.5 % 6.5 % 6.6 %
Estimated value at completion $ 2,459 $ 2,509 $ 2,723
Estimated weighted average margin 34.8 % 28.8 % 25.0 %

(1) We calculate the weighted average stabilized yield as estimated NOI assuming stabilized occupancy divided by TEI.

At December 31, 2018, our development portfolio, including properties under development and prestabilized properties, was 50.8% leased and expected to be completed before July 2020. For additional information on our development portfolio at December 31, 2018, see Item 2. Properties.

Capital Expenditures

We capitalize costs incurred in renovating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis. The following graph summarizes our total capital expenditures and capital expenditures per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year:

Strategic Capital

This operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, as well as promote revenues earned from the unconsolidated ventures. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the number of real estate assets through acquisitions and dispositions and the fair value of the properties owned by the ventures, the transactional activity in the ventures, foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of promotes. These revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital segment through Strategic Capital Expenses and to the Real Estate Operations segment through Rental Expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios.

25

Below are the components of Strategic Capital revenues, expenses and NOI, derived directly from the line items in the Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
-------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ---- ---- - ---- -
Strategic capital revenues $ 406 $ 374 $ 304
Strategic capital expenses (157 ) (155 ) (129 )
Strategic Capital – NOI $ 249 $ 219 $ 175

Below is additional detail of our Strategic Capital revenues, expenses and NOI (in millions):

(1) The U.S. expenses include compensation and personnel costs for employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other regions.

(2) Recurring fees include asset and property management fees.

(3) Transactional fees include leasing commission, acquisition, development and other fees.

(4) The promote revenues represent the third-party partners’ share based on the venture’s cumulative returns to investors over a certain time-period, generally three years. Approximately 40% of promote revenues are paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the Prologis Promote Plan and expensed through Strategic Capital Expenses, as vested.

The following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on historical cost at December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

G&A Expenses

G&A expenses were $239 million, $231 million and $222 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. G&A expenses increased marginally over the last three years due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses based on our performance.

We capitalize certain internal costs directly related to our development and leasing activities. Capitalized G&A expenses primarily included salaries and related costs. The following table summarizes capitalized G&A amounts (in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ---- ---- - ---- -
Building and land development activities $ 63 $ 63 $ 61

Total capitalized G&A expenses $ 100 $ 102 $ 101
Capitalized salaries and related costs as a percent of total salaries and related costs 24.5 % 24.4 % 26.0 %

(1) Based on new accounting guidance, beginning January 1, 2019, we will no longer capitalize internal costs associated with leasing activities and will record these costs to Rental Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses were $947 million, $879 million and $931 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

26

The following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses during these periods (dollars in millions):

(1) The acquisition of properties increased depreciation and amortization expense in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to the DCT Transaction through which we acquired operating properties and the related intangible assets.

(2) The disposition and contribution of properties decreased depreciation and amortization expense during both periods, primarily due to the contribution of the consolidated NAIF operating properties to USLF in July 2017.

Our O&M Operating Portfolio

We manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&M basis, which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim.

Our O&M operating portfolio does not include value-added properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at December 31 (square feet in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
-------------- -------------------- ----- ----------- --- ------------------- -------------------- - ----------- ----- ------------------- --- -------------------- ----------- - ------------------- ----- --- ---- -
 Number of Properties Square Feet Percentage Occupied Number of Properties Square Feet Percentage Occupied Number of Properties Square Feet Percentage Occupied
Consolidated 1,835 348 97.2 % 1,532 297 97.3 % 1,777 332 97.0 %
Unconsolidated 1,561 339 97.8 % 1,557 331 97.1 % 1,359 290 97.2 %
Total 3,396 687 97.5 % 3,089 628 97.2 % 3,136 622 97.1 %

Below are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our O&M operating portfolio. Beginning January 1, 2018, we modified certain definitions of our operating metrics to align methodologies with members of the industrial REIT group. These changes were retroactively applied for all prior periods presented.

27

(1) Square feet of leases commenced and weighted average rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. We retained more than 70% of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, for each year during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018.

(2) Turnover costs are defined as leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the lease commencement for leases greater than one year. In 2018 turnover costs per square foot increased, however, due to the longer terms on leases commenced, this resulted in a lower cost as a percentage of lease value.

Same Store Analysis

Our same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net-effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us to analyze our ongoing business operations.

We define our same store population for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as our O&M properties that were in the operating portfolio at January 1, 2017 and owned throughout the end of the same three-month period in both 2018 and 2017. The same store population excludes non-industrial real estate properties and properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2017) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. Beginning January 1, 2018, we modified our definition of same store to align on consistent methodologies with members of the industrial REIT group. This did not materially change our historical amounts reported. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods. We believe the factors that affect rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and NOI in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for our consolidated portfolio.

As same store is a non-GAAP financial measure, it has certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues, rental recoveries and rental expenses from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to same store property NOI. In addition, we further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent adjustments and amortization of lease intangibles) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to reflect a cash same store number. To clearly label these metrics, they are categorized as same store portfolio NOI – net effective and same store portfolio NOI – cash.

We evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental recoveries, rental expenses and property NOI for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 to the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and within Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

Same store portfolio – NOI – net effective $ 775 $ 746 3.9 %
Same store portfolio – NOI – cash $ 766 $ 734 4.5 %

(1) We include 100% of the same store NOI from the properties in our same store portfolio. During the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date). As a result, only line items labeled “same store portfolio” are comparable period over period.

(2) We exclude non-industrial real estate properties and properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the reporting period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term.

(3) Rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance and utilities. In addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses.

Other Components of Income (Expense)

Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net

We recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of $298 million, $249 million and $206 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars.

See the discussion of our co-investment ventures above in the Strategic Capital segment discussion and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

Interest Expense

The following table details our net interest expense (dollars in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- - ---- - --- ---- - --- -
Gross interest expense $ 269 $ 328 $ 383
Amortization of debt discount (premium) and debt issuance costs, net 12 1 (15 )
Capitalized amounts (52 ) (55 ) (65 )
Net interest expense $ 229 $ 274 $ 303
Weighted average effective interest rate during the year 3.0 % 3.2 % 3.3 %

Our overall debt increased by $1.7 billion from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of DCT on August 22, 2018. Subsequent to the acquisition of DCT, we paid down $1.8 billion of the assumed debt through the issuance of senior notes at significantly lower interest rates than the assumed debt. Gross interest expense decreased in 2018, from the same period in 2017, principally due to lower interest rates and average debt balances during the period. Gross interest expense decreased in 2017, from the same period in 2016, principally due to decreased secured mortgage debt as a result of the USLF contribution and pay downs, and lower interest rates due to the change in the composition of our senior notes.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.

Gains on Real Estate Transactions, net

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized gains on real estate transactions, net of $841 million, $1.2 billion and $757 million, respectively. We utilized the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018.

Over the last three years, we contributed properties, generally that we developed, to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally in Europe, Japan and Mexico. We also sold properties to third parties, primarily from our operating portfolio in the U.S. In 2017, we contributed a significant portfolio of operating properties to USLF. As of the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our O&M disposition program of non-strategic assets that began in 2011. Through this program we generated approximately $14 billion in proceeds resulting in our O&M operating portfolio being focused on the highest-quality properties in the best markets. We expect to continue to develop and contribute properties to our co-investment ventures, depending on market conditions and other factors.

Beginning January 1, 2018, under the new revenue recognition standard, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements we recognized the entire gain attributed to contributions of real estate properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We previously recognized a gain to the extent of the third-party ownership in the unconsolidated co-investment ventures acquiring the property. For deferred gains from sales recorded prior to the adoption, we will continue to recognize these gains over the lives of the underlying real estate properties or at the time of disposition to a third party.

See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the gains we recognized.

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net

The following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net included in earnings (in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- - ---- - --- ---- - -- -
Realized foreign currency and derivative gains (losses):
Gains (losses) on the settlement of undesignated derivative transactions $ (3 ) $ 13 $ 3
Losses on the settlement of transactions (1) - (2 ) (3 )
Total realized foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net (3 ) 11 -

Unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains (losses):
Gains (losses) on the change in fair value of undesignated derivatives and unhedged nonderivative net investment hedges (2) 125 (74 ) 10
Gains (losses) on remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities (1) (5 ) 5 (2 )
Total unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net 120 (69 ) 8
Total foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net $ 117 $ (58 ) $ 8

(1) Unrealized gains or losses were primarily related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity, such as short-term intercompany loans between the U.S. parent and certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries and tax receivables and payables. Realized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement.

(2) We borrow in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest and may designate these borrowings as nonderivative net investment hedges. We recognize gains or losses on the remeasurement of the unhedged portion of this debt and the related accrued interest.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions.

Gains (Losses) on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net

In 2018, we recognized a loss of $2 million upon extinguishment of the $1.8 billion of debt assumed in the DCT Transaction. The loss represents the excess of the prepayment penalties of $49 million over the $47 million premium recorded upon assumption of this debt. We repurchased and redeemed portions of several series of senior notes, term loans and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of a $68 million loss in 2017 and a $2 million gain in 2016. Through these activities, over the last three years, we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, for more information regarding our debt repurchases.

Income Tax Expense

We recognize income tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and in the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.

The following table summarizes our income tax expense (benefit) (in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -- - ---- - -- ---- - -- -
Current income tax expense:
Income tax expense $ 44 $ 39 $ 36
Income tax expense on dispositions 17 19 24
Income tax expense on dispositions related to acquired tax liabilities 1 2 -
Total current income tax expense 62 60 60

Deferred income tax expense (benefit):
Income tax expense (benefit) 2 (3 ) (5 )
Income tax benefit on dispositions related to acquired tax liabilities (1 ) (2 ) -
Total deferred income tax expense (benefit) 1 (5 ) (5 )
Total income tax expense $ 63 $ 55 $ 55

Our income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

This amount represents the third-party investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period. We had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $174 million, $109 million and $83 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in these amounts were $49 million, $45 million and $35 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of Prologis, L.P.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions and other comprehensive income (loss).

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

See Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about environmental liabilities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.

Near-Term Principal Cash Sources and Uses

In addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:

• completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at December 31, 2018, 100 properties in our development portfolio were 50.8% leased with a current investment of $2.1 billion and a TEI of $3.6 billion when completed and leased, leaving $1.5 billion of estimated additional required investment);

• development of new properties for long-term investment or contributions to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;

• capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;

• repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of $273 million in 2019;

• additional investments in current unconsolidated co-investment ventures or new investments in future unconsolidated co-investment ventures;

• acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and

• repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.

We expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):

• available unrestricted cash balances ($344 million at December 31, 2018);

• net cash flow from property operations;

• fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, including promotes;

• distributions received from the co-investment ventures;

• proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;

• proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;

• proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures to achieve long-term ownership targets;

• borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements, other facilities or borrowing arrangements ($3.4 billion available at December 31, 2018, which increased to $3.9 billion available in January 2019 after we upsized our global senior credit facility (the “Global Facility”), as discussed below); and

• proceeds from the issuance of debt.

We may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions.

(1) Excludes the debt assumed in the DCT Transaction of $1.9 billion and repayment of $1.8 billion during 2018. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

At December 31, 2018, we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion was available for borrowing. In January 2019, we upsized our Global Facility to $3.5 billion with maturity in January 2023, bringing our total aggregate borrowing capacity to $4.0 billion.

Our credit ratings at December 31, 2018, were A3 from Moody’s and A- from S&P, both with stable outlook. These ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous rate. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. These covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt, encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Co-Investment Ventures

Certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash.

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash $ (103 ) $ (360 ) $ 543

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities:

• Real estate operations. We receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our Real Estate Operations segment. See the Results of Operations section above for further explanation on our Real Estate Operations segment. The revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of $67 million, $81 million and $94 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

• Strategic capital. We also generate operating cash through our Strategic Capital segment by providing management services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See the Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our Strategic Capital segment. Included in Strategic Capital Revenues is the third-party investors’ share of the total promote revenue, which is recognized in operating activities in the period it is received.

• G&A expenses and equity-based compensation awards. We incurred $239 million, $231 million and $222 million of G&A costs in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in these amounts are equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of $76 million, $77 million and $60 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were recorded to Rental Expenses in the Real Estate Operations segment, Strategic Capital Expenses in the Strategic Capital segment and G&A Expenses.

• Operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. We received $350 million, $307 million and $287 million of distributions from our unconsolidated entities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures distribute the total promote, including our share which is recorded to Investment In and Advances to Unconsolidated Entities and included in operating activities in the period it is received.

• Cash paid for interest and income taxes, net. We paid combined amounts for interest and income taxes, net of amounts received, of $266 million, $325 million and $352 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this activity.

Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities is primarily driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties. Cash used in investing activities is principally driven by our investments in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these activities. In addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in investing activities:

34

• DCT Transaction, net of cash acquired. We paid net cash of $46 million to complete the DCT Transaction in 2018, primarily due to transaction costs. The acquisition was financed through the issuance of equity and assumption of debt. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the DCT Transaction.

• Investments in and advances to. We invested cash in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures, which represented our proportionate share of $160 million, $250 million and $266 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ventures used the funds for the acquisition of properties, development and repayment of debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

• Acquisition of a controlling interest. We paid net cash of $375 million to acquire a controlling interest in certain joint ventures in Brazil in 2017.

• Return of investment. We received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of $360 million, $209 million and $777 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in these amounts were proceeds from the sale or redemption of our investment in these entities and properties sold by certain unconsolidated entities.

• Repayment of notes receivable backed by real estate. We received $34 million, $32 million and $203 million for the repayment of notes received in connection with the disposition of real estate to third parties in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

• Settlement of net investment hedges. We received net proceeds of $18 million, $2 million and $80 million from the settlement of net investment hedges during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative transactions.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by and used in financing activities is primarily driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt, along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions. The following significant transactions impacted our cash provided by or used in financing activities:

• Settlement of noncontrolling interests. We paid net cash of $710 million to acquire our partner’s interest in NAIF and $80 million to acquire our partner’s interest in the Prologis Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P. in 2017.

• Other debt activity. Our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity (in millions):

 2018 2017 2016
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - ----- ---- - -----
 Repurchase of and payments on debt (including extinguishment costs) (1)
 Regularly scheduled debt principal payments and payments at maturity $ 201 $ 238 $ 233
 Senior notes 973 1,567 -
 Term loans 2,484 1,236 1,612
 Secured mortgage debt 508 538 457

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Venture Debt

We had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at December 31, 2018, of $5.4 billion. The ventures listed below had total third-party debt of $8.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded. This debt is non-recourse to Prologis and other investors in the co-investment ventures, matures and bears interest as follows at December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):

 Debt (1) Weighted Average Interest Rate Gross Book Value (1) Ownership %
------------------------------------- -------- ----- ------------------------------ ---- -------------------- - ----- ----------- -----
Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund $ 2,094 4.2% $ 7,907 27.4%
FIBRA Prologis 838 4.3% 2,140 46.7%
Prologis European Logistics Fund 2,238 2.5% 9,400 27.9%
Prologis UK Logistics Venture 310 3.4% 439 15.0%
Nippon Prologis REIT 1,957 0.7% 5,316 15.1%
Prologis China Logistics Venture 711 5.6% 1,178 15.0%
Total $ 8,148 $ 26,380

(1) The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 27.0% at December 31, 2018. Loan-to-value, a non-GAAP measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

At December 31, 2018, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Long-Term Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 (in millions):

 Payments Due by Period
---------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----- ------------ - ----- ------------ - ----------------- ----- ----- - ------
 Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Total
Debt obligations, other than credit facilities $ 273 $ 2,672 $ 2,740 $ 5,426 $ 11,111
Interest on debt obligations, other than credit facilities 281 488 391 726 1,886
Unfunded commitments on the development portfolio (1) 1,214 214 - - 1,428
Operating lease payments (2) 39 73 62 670 844
Total $ 1,807 $ 3,447 $ 3,193 $ 6,822 $ 15,269

(1) We had properties in our consolidated development portfolio (completed and under development) at December 31, 2018, with a TEI of $3.6 billion. The unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we expect to incur as the property is leased.

(2) Due to a new accounting standard effective January 1, 2019, as a lessee we are required to record both a right-of-use asset and lease liability for our ground and office space leases that we expect to approximate the present value of our future minimum lease payments at December 31, 2018. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Distribution and Dividend Requirements

Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, did not modify our current distribution policy. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.48, $0.44 and $0.42 per common share in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board upon the circumstances prevailing at the

36

time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.

We make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. The Class A Units in the OP are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. We paid a quarterly distribution of $0.64665 per Class A Unit in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

At December 31, 2018, we had 1.4 million shares of Series Q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. The annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

Other Commitments

On a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires judgment on the part of management about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and is material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations. Estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.

Acquisitions

We generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. We measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties, excluding those identified as held for sale, on a relative fair value basis.

We make estimates as part of our valuation of the assumed assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. The components of an acquisition typically include buildings, land, improvements, intangible assets or liabilities related to the acquired leases, debt, deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities. The purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated NOI of a property. Key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. The use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and intangible assets and assumed liabilities could affect the future revenues and expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life or lease term.

Recoverability of Real Estate Assets

We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to the estimated NOI of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. Assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, including market rents, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.

The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.

Our FFO Measures

Our FFO measures begin with NAREIT’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis and Core FFO, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.

We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.

These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

We analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.

FFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (“FFO, as modified by Prologis”)

To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:

• deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;

• current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;

• unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;

• foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third-party debt of our foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities; and

• mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.

We use FFO, as modified by Prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.

Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (“Core FFO”)

In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis:

• gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;

• income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;

• impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;

• gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and

• expenses related to natural disasters.

We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.

Limitations on the use of our FFO measures

While we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT’s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are:

• The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.

• Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO.

• Gains or losses from non-development property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.

• The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.

• The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.

• The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation.

• The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.

39

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP (in millions).

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities.

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...
