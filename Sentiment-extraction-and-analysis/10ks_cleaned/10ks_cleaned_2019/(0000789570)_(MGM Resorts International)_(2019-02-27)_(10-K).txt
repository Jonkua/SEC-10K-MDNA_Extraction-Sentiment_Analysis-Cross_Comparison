ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, Las Vegas visitor volume decreased 0.2%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 1% and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue increased by 2% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Results of operations for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts during 2018 were negatively impacted by disruption related to the repositioning and rebranding of Park MGM, discussed below.

Our Regional Operations results are driven and affected by the increasingly competitive jurisdictions that they operate in, including the expansion of other jurisdictions that permit gaming. Results of operations at our Regional Operations were negatively affected by the opening of two casino resorts in Atlantic City, New Jersey in June 2018, which impacted Borgata’s operating results, and benefitted from the opening of MGM Springfield in August 2018, discussed below.

Gross gaming revenue in the Macau market increased 14% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily as a result of growth on the Cotai Strip. Additionally, according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, visitor arrivals increased 10% and overnight visitors increased 7% in 2018 compared to 2017. As a significant number of MGM Macau’s customers are from mainland China, we believe operating results at MGM Macau are affected by economic conditions in mainland China as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland China and Macau. Despite concerns over the sustainability of economic growth in China, we expect the Macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland China market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau. We believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within the Macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased consistently over the last several years. Additionally, we have seen growth due to the opening of MGM Cotai in February 2018.

Pursuant to a master lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, and MGM National Harbor from the landlord. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP. All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease, have been eliminated in consolidation.

In July 2018, MGP completed its acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield, an Ohio limited liability company that owns the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park. Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of Hard Rock Café International (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager of the property. See Note 4 and Note 17 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this acquisition, the Empire City Acquisition, the Northfield OpCo sale, and the Park MGM Lease Transaction.

In January 2019, we announced the implementation of the MGM 2020 plan to further reduce costs, improve efficiencies and position us for growth. We expect to deliver annualized Adjusted EBITDA benefit of $300 million in aggregate, consisting of $200 million by the end of 2020 and an additional $100 million by the end of 2021. The MGM 2020 plan will be a company-wide, business-optimization initiative aimed to leverage a more centralized organization to maximize profitability and, through key investments in technology, lay the groundwork for our digital transformation to drive revenue growth.

Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:

 • Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 22% to 26% of table games drop and 18% to 21% of table games drop at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations, respectively, and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle and 9% to 9.5% of slots handle at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations, respectively; and

 • Hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are:

 • Gaming revenue indicators: MGM China utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.3% of turnover. Win for main floor gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 16% to 22% of table games drop.

Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Summary Financial Results

The following table summarizes our operating results:

 Year Ended December 31,
---------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---------- ---- - ---------- ---- - ---------
 2018 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Net revenues $ 11,763,096 $ 10,797,479 $ 9,478,269
Operating income 1,469,486 1,712,527 2,078,199
Net income 583,894 2,088,184 1,235,846
Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International 466,772 1,952,052 1,100,408

Summary Operating Results

Consolidated net revenues for 2018 increased 9% compared to 2017 due primarily to the opening of MGM Cotai on February 13, 2018 and the opening of MGM Springfield on August 24, 2018. Consolidated net revenues for 2017 increased 14% compared to 2016 due primarily to the full year of operations at Borgata and MGM National Harbor, an increase in casino revenue and rooms revenue at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and an increase in casino revenue at MGM China, as discussed further below.

32

Consolidated operating income in 2018 decreased 14% compared to 2017. Consolidated operating income in 2018 benefited from a $45 million gain related to the sale of Grand Victoria and also included $24 million of business interruption insurance proceeds primarily at Mandalay Bay. The prior year period included a benefit of $36 million related to Borgata’s share of a property tax settlement from Atlantic City and a benefit of $45 million related to the modification of the NV Energy exit fee, which included the benefit recognized at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts as well as our 50% share of the benefit recognized at CityCenter. Consolidated operating income was negatively affected by the ramp up of operations at our recently opened MGM Springfield and MGM Cotai resorts inclusive of depreciation expense associated with the new resorts, disruption related to the rebranding at Park MGM, and an increase in corporate expense discussed below. In addition, preopening and start-up expenses increased as discussed below in “Operating Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense, including share-based compensation for corporate employees, increased to $419 million in 2018 from $357 million in 2017, and included $19 million in transaction costs, MGM China corporate expense of $19 million, and costs incurred related to the corporate brand campaign and the MGM 2020 and finance modernization initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets at MGM China of $166 million was included in corporate in our non-GAAP reconciliations included herein for 2018. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $148 million in 2018 compared to $146 million in 2017.

Consolidated operating income was $1.7 billion in 2017 and included the impact of the items discussed above as well as a full year of operations at Borgata and MGM National Harbor. Operating income of $2.1 billion in 2016 included a $430 million gain recognized on the Borgata acquisition and a $401 million gain related to the sale of Crystals at CityCenter, which was partially offset by charges of $152 million of NV Energy exit expense associated with our strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy. Operating income in 2017 also benefitted from a decrease in preopening expense as discussed below in “Operating Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense increased to $357 million in 2017 from $313 million in 2016, primarily from a $16 million charge for the Operating Partnership’s share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, with the remainder of the increase primarily related to corporate brand campaign expenses, legal expenses, and charitable contributions. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $146 million in 2017 compared to $528 million in 2016, which included the gain related to the sale of Crystals.

Other 9,307 12,822 21,266
 $ 147,690 $ 146,222 $ 528,287

We completed our acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016 and therefore began to consolidate Borgata beginning on that date. Prior thereto our 50% ownership interest in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method.

In 2018, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $138 million compared to $133 million in 2017, primarily due to a $12 million gain on the sale of Mandarin Oriental that we recognized in 2018 related to the reversal of basis differences in excess of our share of the loss recorded by CityCenter. At Aria, casino revenues decreased 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in incentives and a decrease in table games hold. CityCenter’s non-casino revenues increased 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily related to an increase in food and beverage revenue due in part to an increase in restaurant revenues and an increase in catering and banquets during the year.

In 2017, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $133 million compared to $446 million in 2016, primarily due to our $401 million share of a gain recognized by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals and the corresponding reversal of certain basis differences in 2016. At Aria, casino revenues increased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in table games win and slots win. Rooms revenue increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016 related to an increase in REVPAR and food and beverage revenue increased 6% in 2017 due in part to an increase in catering and banquets during the year.

Non-operating Results

Interest expense. The following table summarizes information related to interest on our long-term debt:

 Year Ended December 31,
----------------------- ----------------------- ------- - ---- - -------- ---- - -------- -
 2018 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Total interest incurred $ 821,229 $ 779,855 $ 814,731
Interest capitalized (51,716 ) (111,110 ) (119,958 )
 $ 769,513 $ 668,745 $ 694,773

38

Gross interest expense in 2018 increased $41 million compared to 2017 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding relating to our senior notes and our credit facilities and an increase in the weighted average interest rate of our credit facilities, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. Gross interest expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average debt outstanding related to our senior notes and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. This was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding under our credit facilities and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.

Capitalized interest in 2018 decreased from 2017 due primarily to the substantial completion of MGM Cotai in February 2018, partially offset by an increase related to the MGM Springfield project, which was substantially completed in August 2018. Capitalized interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to the opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016, partially offset by the MGM Cotai and MGM Springfield projects.

Non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates. Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $18 million in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time, we began to consolidate Borgata. Prior thereto, our 50% ownership interest in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method.

Other, net. Other expense in 2018 decreased $30 million compared to 2017 due primarily to the loss incurred on early retirement of debt in 2017 of $44 million related to our early retirement of the 11.375% senior notes due 2018 and the MGM National Harbor credit facility. Other expense in 2017 decreased $24 million compared to 2016 primarily due to the loss on the early retirement of debt in 2016 of $65 million related to our 7.625% senior notes due 2017, our 7.5% senior notes due 2016, our 10% senior notes due 2016, and our prior senior credit facility, offset by the loss on early retirement of debt incurred in 2017 as described above.

Income taxes. The following table summarizes information related to our income taxes:

 Year Ended December 31,
------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ------- - ---- - --------- ---- - --------- -
 2018 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Income before income taxes $ 634,006 $ 960,790 $ 1,257,589
Benefit (provision) for income taxes (50,112 ) 1,127,394 (21,743 )
Effective income tax rate 7.9 % (117.3 )% 1.7 %
Federal, state and foreign income taxes paid, net of refunds $ (10,100 ) $ 181,651 $ 68,236

Our effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the reversal of Macau shareholder dividend tax that was accrued in 2017 upon receipt of the extension of the annual fee arrangement, partially offset by SAB 118 measurement period tax expense related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  Our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required due to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by the accrual of the Macau shareholder dividend tax. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the Borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the Macau complementary tax on gaming profits.

Cash taxes paid decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act changes, most notably the increase in the recapture of overall domestic losses from 50 percent of U.S. taxable income to 100 percent of U.S. taxable income, resulting in increased FTC carryover usage.  Cash taxes paid increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable income and state income taxes attributable to Borgata, which has been consolidated since the August 2016 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in the company.

Non-GAAP Measures

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. “Adjusted Property EBITDA margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDA divided by net revenues. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies.

39

We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, and Adjusted Property EBITDA margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin in a different manner.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows – Summary

Our cash flows consisted of the following:

 Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---------- - ---- - ---------- ---- - ---------- -
 2018 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,722,539 $ 2,206,411 $ 1,533,972
Net cash used in investing activities (2,083,021 ) (1,580,592 ) (2,276,204 )
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 389,234 (568,778 ) 519,422

Cash Flows

Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017. Operating cash flows decreased in the current period primarily due to the change in working capital related to timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China, as well as a decrease in consolidated operating income, and an increase in cash paid for interest. In 2018 we received net cash tax refunds of $10 million compared to cash paid for taxes of $182 million in 2017 primarily as a result of the Tax Act.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2017 in comparison to 2016 was positively affected by increase in operating income at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations and changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes to $182 million in 2017 compared to $68 million in 2016.

43

Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.

Cash used in investing activities in 2018 increased in comparison to 2017 as a result of the $1.0 billion outflow by the Operating Partnership for the Northfield acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $377 million in capital expenditures as well as an inflow of $164 million for proceeds received related to the sale of our investment in Grand Victoria. The decrease in capital expenditures from 2018 to 2017 of $377 million primarily reflects less expenditures for the developments of MGM Cotai and MGM National Harbor, partially offset by increased expenditures for MGM Springfield and the rebranding at Park MGM, as discussed in further detail below.

Cash used in investing activities in 2017 decreased in comparison to 2016 as a result of the $559 million outflow for the Borgata acquisition in 2016 as well as a $398 million decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease of $240 million in the distributions received from CityCenter.  The decrease in capital expenditures from 2016 to 2017 of $398 million primarily reflects less expenditures for the developments of MGM Cotai and MGM National Harbor, partially offset by increased expenditures for MGM Springfield and the rebranding of Park MGM, as discussed in further detail below.

Capital Expenditures

In 2018, we had capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, of which $376 million related to MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $340 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $36 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.1 billion included $368 million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $228 million related to the Park MGM rebranding project, as well as expenditures relating to the expansion of the convention center at MGM Grand Las Vegas and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.

In 2017, we had capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, which included $908 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $856 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $53 million related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $956 million included $269 million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $221 million related to the rebranding at Park MGM, and $195 million primarily related to the finalization of construction of MGM National Harbor, as well as various resorts’ room remodels, construction of additional convention space at MGM Grand Las Vegas, the parking garage at Excalibur, a waterpark at Circus Circus, and various restaurant and entertainment venue remodels.

In 2016, we had capital expenditures of $2.3 billion, which included $971 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $948 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $23 million related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.3 billion included $741 million related to the construction of MGM National Harbor, $121 million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $39 million related to the construction of The Park, as well as various room remodels including the tower rooms at Mandalay Bay, construction of additional exhibit space at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, construction of the Park Theater and rebranding at Park MGM, construction of the parking garage at Excalibur and restaurant and entertainment venue remodels.

Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2018 from the cash used in financing activities in 2017 primarily as a result of net borrowings of debt in 2018 of $2.2 billion in comparison to net repayments of debt in 2017 of $138 million, partially offset by MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2017, and an increase in shares repurchased in 2018 compared to 2017.

Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2017 from the cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily as a result of the net proceeds of $1.1 billion from MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2016 compared to the net proceeds of  $388 million from MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2017, dividends that we began paying in 2017, as well as an increase of $67 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest owners, partially offset by net payments of debt in 2017 of $138 million compared to net repayments of debt of $301 million in 2016 as well as the $100 million paid in 2016 as part of consideration for the purchase of additional shares of MGM China.

In 2016, we repaid net debt of $301 million.

MGM Resorts International stock repurchase program. In May 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and completed the previously announced $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. We repurchased approximately $1.3 billion and $328 million of our common stock in connection with the program in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

MGM Resorts International dividends. During 2018, we paid dividends each quarter of $0.12 per share, totaling $261 million for the year.

 • $134 million of dividends paid in 2017, of which we received $75 million and noncontrolling interests received $59 million; and

 • $104 million of dividends paid in 2016, of which we received $53 million and noncontrolling interests received $51 million.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity

Anticipated uses of cash. We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our senior secured credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and acquisitions.

We held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, of which MGM China held $510 million and the Operating Partnership held $60 million. At December 31, 2018, we had $15.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $750 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.3 billion senior secured credit facility, $2.8 billion outstanding under the $3.6 billion Operating Partnership credit facility, and $2.4 billion outstanding under the $2.8 billion MGM China credit facility. We expect to make domestic capital investments at our resorts and corporate entities of $600 million to $650 million, which excludes $45 million to $50 million of construction closeout costs at MGM Springfield. Additionally, we expect to make capital investments at MGM China of $350 million to $375 million, which includes $250 million of construction closeout costs at MGM Cotai and $100 million to $125 million of maintenance capital expenditures.

We also closed the acquisition of Empire City in January 2019 for a purchase price of approximately $864 million. We funded the acquisition of Empire City with the issuance of approximately $266 million of our common stock, the assumption of approximately $246 million of debt, which was immediately assumed and repaid by the Operating Partnership, and the remaining balance in cash. Additionally, in January 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2027 and, in February 2019, we repaid our $850 million 8.625% notes due 2019. We expect to meet our remaining debt maturities and planned capital expenditure requirements with future anticipated operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facilities.

Principal Debt Arrangements

See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2018.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consists primarily of our investment in CityCenter. We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than the Operating Partnership’s cash flow hedges. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment facilities in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. In addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

(1) Reflects scheduled amortization payments and debt maturities. Refer to Note 9 for further information on long-term debt.

(2) Estimated interest payments, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 and management’s forecasted LIBOR rates for our senior credit facility, the Operating Partnership senior credit facility and HIBOR rates for the MGM China credit facility.

(3) Refer to Note 11 for further information on operating leases.

(4) Reflects future expected cash outlays of our other long-term liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, and, accordingly, we have not included such liabilities above that do not have future cash payments, such as deferred rent. We have also excluded deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented in the table as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain.

(5) Our purchase obligations represent minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors, primarily advertising and entertainment contracts. Also, although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, and hence, have not been included in the table above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and gaming promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.

47

In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

 December 31,
 ------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- ---- - -------
 2018 2017
 (In thousands)
 Casino receivables $ 419,127 $ 343,869
 Allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable 85,544 86,126
 Allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable 20% 25%

Approximately $48 million and $31 million of casino receivables and $12 million and $7 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to MGM China at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to a decrease in specific reserve at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts as a result of favorable collections. At December 31, 2018, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $4 million.

Fixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

48

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the Borgata trade name using the relief-from -royalty method, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% in 2018 and 4% in 2017. For our 2016 annual impairment tests we utilized a quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow approach for license rights and using the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying values, with the fair value of the Borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the Borgata acquisition which occurred in August 2016. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.

We review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2018, 2017 or 2016. For our 2018, 2017, and 2016 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. For reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis, the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  None of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had other-than-temporary impairment in 2018, 2017, or 2016.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

49

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” or long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with t...
