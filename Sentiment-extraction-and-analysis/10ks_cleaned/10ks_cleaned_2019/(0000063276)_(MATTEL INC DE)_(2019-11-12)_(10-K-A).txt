Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Note that amounts within this Item shown in millions may not foot due to rounding.
The following discussion also includes gross sales and currency exchange rate impact, non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Regulation G"), to supplement the financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Mattel uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for a more detailed discussion, including a reconciliation of gross sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net sales, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Overview
Mattel is a leading global children’s entertainment company that specializes in the design and production of quality toys and consumer products. Mattel's products are among the most widely recognized toy products in the world. Mattel's mission is to "create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain, and develop children through play." In order to deliver on this mission, Mattel is focused on the following two-part strategy to transform Mattel from a toy manufacturing company into an IP-driven, high-performing toy company:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the short- to mid-term, restore profitability by reshaping operations and regain topline growth by growing Mattel's Power Brands (Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends, and American Girl) and expanding Mattel's brand portfolio.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the mid- to long-term, capture the full value of Mattel's IP through franchise management and the development of Mattel's online retail and e-commerce capabilities.

Revision of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
As discussed in the Explanatory Note and in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," this Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K (this "Amendment" or "Form 10-K/A") revises our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, to reflect the correction of certain misstatements. Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects the effects of the revisions.
Results of Operations

2018 Compared to 2017
Consolidated Results
Net sales for 2018 were $4.51 billion, an 8% decrease, as compared to $4.88 billion in 2017. Net sales for 2018 were negatively impacted by 6% from lower Toys "R" Us sales as a result of its liquidation. Net loss for 2018 was $533.3 million, or $1.55 per share, as compared to a net loss of $1.05 billion, or $3.07 per share, in 2017, primarily due to lower income tax expense, related to the establishment in the third quarter of 2017 of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets that will likely not be realized, and a lower advertising and promotion rate.

Gross sales were $5.08 billion in 2018, a decrease of $438.6 million, or 8%, as compared to $5.51 billion in 2017, with an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The decrease in gross sales was a result of lower Toy Box and Power Brands sales, and included lower Toys "R" Us sales of 6%.

32

The 3% decrease in Power Brands gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of American Girl products and Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends products, partially offset by higher sales of Barbie products. The 28% decrease in American Girl gross sales was primarily due to lower sales in proprietary retail and direct channels, a strategic shift away from the utilization of external distribution channels, and the sale of Corolle in the first quarter of 2018. Of the 13% decrease in Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales, 6% was due to lower sales of Fisher-Price infant products and 5% was due to lower sales of Thomas & Friends products. The 14% increase in Barbie gross sales was primarily driven by positive POS brand momentum.
The 16% decrease in Toy Box gross sales was due to lower sales of Toy Box Partner Brands and Toy Box Owned Brands products. Of the 23% decrease in Toy Box Partner Brands gross sales, 24% was due to lower sales of CARS products, primarily as a result of the 2017 CARS 3 theatrical release, 5% was due to lower sales of DC Comics action figures products, and 5% was due to lower sales of DC Comics Superhero Girls products, partially offset by initial sales of Jurassic World products of 21% as a result of the 2018 theatrical release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Of the 10% decrease in Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales, 8% was due to lower sales of MEGA products.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 60.2% in 2018, as compared to 62.6% in 2017. Cost of sales decreased by $340.8 million, or 11%, to $2.72 billion in 2018 from $3.06 billion in 2017, as compared to an 8% decrease in net sales. Within cost of sales, product and other costs decreased by $295.0 million, or 12%, to $2.15 billion in 2018 from $2.44 billion in 2017; freight and logistics expenses decreased by $25.2 million, or 7%, to $344.2 million in 2018 from $369.4 million in 2017; and royalty expenses decreased by $20.5 million, or 8%, to $224.0 million in 2018 from $244.5 million in 2017.
Gross Margin
Gross margin increased to 39.8% in 2018 from 37.4% in 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by Structural Simplification savings and lower obsolescence expense, partially offset by input cost inflation of raw materials and plant labor.
Advertising and Promotion Expenses
Advertising and promotion expenses primarily consist of: (i) media costs, which primarily include the media, planning, and buying fees for television, print, and online advertisements, (ii) non-media costs, which primarily include commercial and website production, merchandising, and promotional costs, (iii) retail advertising costs, which primarily include consumer direct catalogs, newspaper inserts, fliers, and mailers, and (iv) generic advertising costs, which primarily include trade show costs. Advertising and promotion expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% in 2018 from 13.2% in 2017, primarily driven by Structural Simplification savings of approximately $30 million.
Other Selling and Administrative Expenses
Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.51 billion, or 33.4% of net sales, in 2018, as compared to $1.52 billion, or 31.1% of net sales, in 2017. The decrease in other selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by Structural Simplification savings of approximately $165 million, substantially offset by higher incentive compensation expense of approximately $65 million, higher severance and restructuring costs of approximately $39 million, and bad debt expense, net, of approximately $32 million related to the Toys "R" Us liquidation in 2018.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $181.9 million in 2018, as compared to $105.2 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt and higher outstanding borrowings throughout 2018.
Other Non-Operating Expense, Net
Other non-operating expense, net, was $7.3 million in 2018, as compared to $68.1 million in 2017. The decrease in other non-operating expense, net, was primarily driven by a $59.0 million loss related to the discontinuation of Mattel's Venezuelan operations in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Venezuelan Operations" for more information.

33

Provision for Income Taxes
Mattel’s provision for income taxes was $116.2 million in 2018, as compared to $553.3 million in 2017. The 2018 income tax provision included a $14.6 million expense related to changes to its indefinite reinvestment assertion and a $3.7 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings (net of related valuation allowance change). The 2017 income tax provision included net tax expense of $457.1 million, primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2017 on U.S. deferred tax assets that will likely not be realized and a provisional estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gross sales for the North America segment were $2.42 billion in 2018, a decrease of $114.6 million, or 5%, as compared to $2.54 billion in 2017, with an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The decrease in the North America segment gross sales was primarily a result of lower Toy Box gross sales and included an unfavorable impact from lower Toys "R" Us sales of 12%. Gross sales reflect Toys "R" Us gross sales reversals of approximately $27 million and $47 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 The 4% increase in Power Brands gross sales was primarily due to higher sales of Barbie and Hot Wheels products, partially offset by lower sales of Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends products. The 19% increase in Barbie gross sales was primarily driven by positive POS brand momentum. The 12% increase in Hot Wheels gross sales was primarily driven by the brand's 50th anniversary. Of the 10% decrease in Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales, 4% was due to lower sales of Thomas & Friends products and 4% was due to lower sales of Fisher-Price preschool products.
The 17% decrease in Toy Box gross sales was due to lower sales of Toy Box Partner Brands and Toy Box Owned Brands products. Of the 19% decrease in Toy Box Partner Brands gross sales, 19% was due to lower sales of CARS products, primarily as a result of the 2017 CARS 3 theatrical release, 6% was due to lower sales of DC Comics action figures products, and 5% was due to lower sales of DC Comics Superhero Girls products, partially offset by initial sales of Jurassic World products of 24% as a result of the 2018 theatrical release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Of the 14% decrease in Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales, 8% was due to lower sales of MEGA products and 4% was due to lower sales of Monster High products.

34

Cost of sales decreased 9% in 2018, as compared to a 4% decrease in net sales, primarily due to lower product and other costs and lower freight and logistics expenses. Gross margin in 2018 increased primarily due to Structural Simplification savings and lower obsolescence expense, partially offset by input cost inflation of raw materials and plant labor. As a result of the Toys "R" Us net sales reversals in 2018 and 2017, gross margin included the cost of sales for the inventory sold, but excluded the corresponding net sales.
North America segment income was $220.8 million in 2018, as compared to segment income of $102.7 million in 2017, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower advertising and promotion expenses.

Gross sales were $5.51 billion in 2017, a decrease of $559.6 million, or 9%, as compared to $6.07 billion in 2016, with a favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The decrease in gross sales was due to decreases in Toy Box and Power Brands sales, and was partially a result of the reversal of approximately $47 million of gross sales related to Toys "R" Us filing for bankruptcy. In addition, Mattel began to reduce shipping to Toys "R" Us in early September 2017, which resulted in a loss of revenue in the second half of 2017.
The 8% decrease in Power Brands gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of American Girl products and Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends products. The 20% decrease in American Girl gross sales was primarily due to lower sales across channels. Of the 11% decrease in Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales, 5% was due to lower sales of Fisher-Price infant products and 4% was due to lower sales of Thomas & Friends products.
The 11% decrease in Toy Box gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of Toy Box Owned Brands products, partially offset by higher sales of Toy Box Partner Brands products. Of the 25% decrease in Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales, 10% was due to lower sales of Monster High products and 8% was due to lower sales of MEGA products. Of the 10% increase in Toy Box Partner Brands gross sales, 29% was due to higher sales of CARS products, primarily as a result of the 2017 CARS 3 theatrical release, partially offset by lower sales of DC Comics Superhero Girls products of 6% and lower sales of Minecraft products of 5%.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 62.6% in 2017, as compared to 53.3% in 2016. Cost of sales increased by $150.5 million, or 5%, to $3.06 billion in 2017 from $2.91 billion in 2016, as compared to a 10% decrease in net sales. Within cost of sales, product and other costs increased by $92.4 million, or 4%, to $2.44 billion in 2017 from $2.35 billion in 2016, primarily as a result of higher obsolescence expense; freight and logistics expenses increased by $42.5 million, or 13%, to $369.4 million in 2017 from $326.9 million in 2016; and royalty expenses increased $15.6 million, or 7%, to $244.5 million in 2017 from $228.9 million in 2016.

38

Gross Margin
Gross margin decreased to 37.4% in 2017 from 46.7% in 2016. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher obsolescence expense, unfavorable product mix, higher freight and logistics expenses, asset impairments, and an unfavorable impact from Toys "R" Us filing for bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of the Toys "R" Us net sales reversal, gross margin includes the cost of sales for the inventory sold, but excludes the corresponding net sales.
Advertising and Promotion Expenses
Advertising and promotion expenses primarily consist of: (i) media costs, which primarily include the media, planning, and buying fees for television, print, and online advertisements, (ii) non-media costs, which primarily include commercial and website production, merchandising, and promotional costs, (iii) retail advertising costs, which primarily include consumer direct catalogs, newspaper inserts, fliers, and mailers, and (iv) generic advertising costs, which primarily include trade show costs. Advertising and promotion expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.2% in 2017 from 11.6% in 2016, primarily as a result of lower net sales and higher non-media costs.
Other Selling and Administrative Expenses
Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.52 billion, or 31.1% of net sales, in 2017, as compared to $1.39 billion, or 25.5% of net sales, in 2016. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to asset impairments of approximately $36 million, higher severance and restructuring expenses of approximately $25 million, higher employee-related costs of approximately $19 million, higher incentive and equity compensation of approximately $16 million, and costs associated with the new American Girl flagship store in New York City of approximately $14 million.
Other Non-Operating Expense, Net
Other non-operating expense, net, was $68.1 million in 2017, as compared to $32.0 million in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Mattel initiated actions to discontinue operations in Venezuela, which resulted in a $59.0 million loss in other non-operating expense, net, related to the associated cumulative translation adjustments. In 2016, Mattel recognized approximately $26 million of foreign currency exchange loss related to a change in the remeasurement rate used by Mattel's Venezuelan subsidiary. See Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Venezuelan Operations" for more information.
Provision for Income Taxes
Mattel’s provision for income taxes was $553.3 million in 2017, as compared to $89.1 million in 2016. Mattel's effective tax rate on loss before income taxes was (110.4)% in 2017, as compared to an effective tax rate on income before income taxes of 22.2% in 2016. The 2017 income tax provision included net tax expense of $457.1 million, primarily Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2016 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $16.8 million primarily related to reassessments of prior years' tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

Gross sales for the North America segment were $2.54 billion in 2017, a decrease of $499.5 million, or 16%, as compared to $3.04 billion in 2016, with a favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The decrease in the North America segment gross sales was a result of lower Toy Box and Power Brands sales. As a result of Toys "R" Us filing for bankruptcy, Mattel reversed approximately $47 million of gross sales in the third quarter of 2017. In addition, Mattel began to reduce shipping to Toys "R" Us in early September 2017, which resulted in a loss of revenue in the second half of 2017.
The 13% decrease in Power Brands gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends and Hot Wheels products. Of the 16% decrease in Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales, 7% was due to lower sales of Fisher-Price infant products and 4% was due to lower sales of Thomas & Friends products. The 11% decrease in Hot Wheels gross sales was primarily driven by a tough comparison from CARS 3 in 2017.
The 22% decrease in Toy Box gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of Toy Box Owned Brands products. Of the 34% decrease in Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales, 10% was due to lower sales of MEGA products, 10% was due to lower sales of Monster High products, 4% was due to lower sales of Ever After High products, and 3% was due to lower sales of Power Wheels products.
Cost of sales decreased 2% in 2017, as compared to a 16% decrease in net sales, primarily due to lower product and other costs, partially offset by higher freight and logistics expenses. Gross margins in 2017 decreased due to higher freight and logistics expenses, an unfavorable impact from Toys "R" Us filing for bankruptcy, and higher obsolescence expense. As a result of the Toys "R" Us net sales reversal, gross margin includes the cost of sales for the inventory sold, but excludes the corresponding net sales.
North America segment income decreased by 82% to $102.7 million in 2017, as compared to $560.2 million in 2016, primarily due to lower gross profit.

The increase in the International segment gross sales was driven primarily by higher Toy Box sales.

41

The 5% increase in Toy Box gross sales was primarily due to higher sales of Toy Box Partner Brands products, partially offset by lower sales of Toy Box Owned Brands products. Of the 30% increase in Toy Box Partner Brands gross sales, 46% was due to higher sales of CARS products, primarily as a result of the 2017 CARS 3 theatrical release, partially offset by lower sales of Partner Brands action figures products of 9% and lower sales of DC Comics Superhero Girls products of 4%. The 11% decrease in Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales was primarily driven by lower sales of Monster High products of 10%.
Cost of sales increased 9% in 2017, as compared to flat net sales, primarily due to higher product and other costs and higher royalty expenses. Gross margins in 2017 decreased as a result of unfavorable product mix and higher royalty expense.
International segment loss was $6.3 million in 2017, as compared to segment income of 287.7 million in 2016, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher other selling and administrative expenses.

The decrease in American Girl segment gross sales was primarily due to lower sales of American Girl brands products as a result of lower sales across channels.
Cost of sales increased 14% in 2017, as compared to a 21% decrease in net sales, primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence expense. Gross margins in 2017 decreased as a result of higher obsolescence expense, unfavorable product mix, lower licensing income, and higher freight and logistics expenses.
American Girl segment loss was $73.0 million in 2017, as compared to segment income of $106.4 million in 2016, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher other selling and administrative expenses.

Cost Savings Programs
Structural Simplification Cost Savings Program
During the third quarter of 2017, Mattel initiated its Structural Simplification cost savings program and expects to exceed $650 million in cost savings by 2020.
The major initiatives of the Structural Simplification cost savings program include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Reducing manufacturing complexity, including SKU reduction, and implementing process improvement initiatives at owned and co-manufacturing facilities;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Streamlining the organizational structure and reducing headcount expense to better align with the revenue base; and

- -----------------------------
• Optimizing advertising spend.

Mattel realized cost savings (before severance, investments, and cost inflation) of approximately $372 million (approximately $177 million within gross profit, approximately $165 million within other selling and administrative expenses, and approximately $30 million within advertising and promotion expenses) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Mattel continues to assess opportunities for incremental savings through its expanded scope of work to optimize its manufacturing footprint and supply chain.

42

In connection with the Structural Simplification cost savings program, Mattel recorded severance and other restructuring charges of $109.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the total charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018, $62.9 million relate to severance charges and $47.0 million relate to other restructuring costs. Of the $47.0 million of other restructuring costs, $5.7 million relate to non-cash plant restructuring charges, and the remainder consists primarily of consulting fees. To date, Mattel has recorded cumulative severance and other restructuring charges of $155.0 million and expects to incur total charges of approximately $200 million related to the Structural Simplification cost savings program.

Income Taxes
Mattel’s provision for income taxes was $116.2 million in 2018, as compared to $553.3 million in 2017 and $89.1 million in 2016. The 2018 income tax provision included allowance change). The 2017 income tax provision included a net expense of $457.1 million, primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2017 on U.S. deferred tax assets that will likely not be realized and a provisional estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2016 income tax provision included net tax benefits of $16.8 million, primarily related to reassessments of prior years’ tax liabilities based on the status of audits and tax filings in various jurisdictions around the world, settlements, and enacted tax law changes, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Mattel’s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and equivalents balances, including access to earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, short-term borrowing facilities, including its $1.60 billion senior secured revolving credit facilities ("the senior secured revolving credit facilities"), and issuances of long-term debt securities. Cash flows from operating activities could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattel’s products, which could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or by increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattel’s ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as global economic crises and tight credit environments, an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements and its senior secured revolving credit facility covenants, or a deterioration of Mattel’s credit ratings. Mattel’s ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity.
Of Mattel’s $594.5 million in cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2018, approximately $400 million is held by foreign subsidiaries. Mattel has several liquidity options to fund its operations and obligations; such obligations may include investing and financing activities such as debt service, dividends, and share repurchases. Cash flows generated by its worldwide operations, the senior secured revolving credit facilities, alternative forms of financing, and access to capital markets are available to fund Mattel's operations and obligations.
The U.S. Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, provides Mattel with a reduced cost to access the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. As such, Mattel has evaluated its intentions related to its indefinite reinvestment assertion and has recorded a $14.6 million tax charge related to approximately $400 million of foreign earnings that will not be indefinitely reinvested. Mattel also recorded a $3.7 million one-time transition tax change related to the deemed repatriation tax of the historical earnings of Mattel's foreign subsidiaries.
In October 2017, Mattel's Board of Directors determined to suspend Mattel's quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to increase financial flexibility, strengthen the balance sheet, and facilitate strategic investments. Mattel paid dividends of $0.38 per share to holders of its common stock in the first and second quarter of 2017 and $0.15 per share in the third quarter of 2017.
Current Market Conditions
Mattel is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. Mattel continues to actively manage its capital structure and believes that it has sufficient liquidity to run its business.
Subject to market conditions, Mattel intends to utilize its senior secured revolving credit facilities or alternative forms of financing to meet its short-term liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facilities. Market conditions could affect certain terms of other debt instruments that Mattel enters into from time to time.

43

Mattel monitors the third-party depository institutions that hold Mattel's cash and equivalents. Mattel’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal, and secondarily on maximizing the yield on those funds. Mattel diversifies its cash and equivalents among counterparties and securities to minimize risks.
Mattel is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of its counterparties in hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the fair value measurements of Mattel’s foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Mattel closely monitors its counterparties and takes action, as necessary, to manage its counterparty credit risk.
Mattel expects that some of its customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials. Mattel monitors its customers’ financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate Mattel’s accounts receivable collectibility risks, and customer terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary. Additionally, Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment. As a result of the Toys "R" Us liquidation in the first quarter of 2018, Mattel reversed net sales that occurred during the first quarter of 2018 and related accounts receivable of approximately $30 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Mattel recorded bad debt expense, net of approximately $32 million related to outstanding Toys "R" Us receivables at the time of the Toys "R" Us liquidation.
Mattel sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for its employees. Actual returns below the expected rate of return, along with changes in interest rates that affect the measurement of the liability, would impact the amount and timing of Mattel’s future contributions to these plans.
Operating Activities
Cash flows used for operating activities were $27.3 million during 2018, which were in line with the $27.6 million cash flows used for operating activities during 2017. During 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities were $594.5 million. The change in 2017 from 2016 was due to the net loss for the year, excluding the net impact of the establishment of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets that will likely not be realized and an estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act, and other non-cash charges.
Investing Activities
Cash flows used for investing activities were $160.8 million during 2018, as compared to $235.7 million during 2017 and $311.9 million during 2016. The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities in 2018 from 2017 was primarily driven by lower capital spending, partially offset by higher payments for foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to higher proceeds from foreign currency forward exchange contracts and 2016 payments related to the acquisitions of Fuhu assets and Sproutling, Inc., partially offset by higher capital spending.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used for financing activities were $285.2 million during 2018, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities $458.5 million during 2017 and cash flows used for financing activities of $281.5 million during 2016. The change in cash flows from financing activities in 2018 from 2017 was primarily driven by lower net proceeds from long-term and short-term borrowings of approximately $1.1 billion, partially offset by $312.0 million of dividend payments during 2017. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to the $1.00 billion issuance of senior notes in December 2017, partially offset by higher net repayments of short-term borrowings.
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, Mattel did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. Mattel's share repurchase program was first announced on July 21, 2003. On July 17, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized Mattel to increase its share repurchase program by $500.0 million. At December 31, 2018, share repurchase authorizations of $203.0 million had not been executed. Repurchases under the program will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. Mattel's share repurchase program has no expiration date.
During 2018, Mattel did not pay any dividends to holders of its common stock. During 2017 and 2016, Mattel paid total dividends per share of $0.91 and $1.52 respectively, to holders of its common stock. The Board of Directors declared the dividends, if any, on a quarterly basis, and Mattel paid the dividends during the quarters in which the dividends were declared, if applicable. The payment of dividends on common stock is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and is subject to customary limitations. Dividend payments were $312.0 million and $518.5 million in 2017, and 2016, respectively.

44

Seasonal Financing
See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt."
Credit Rating
In July 2018, Fitch changed Mattel's long-term credit rating from B+ to B-, with a negative outlook. In May 2018, Moody's changed Mattel's long-term credit rating from Ba3 to B1, with a stable outlook. In April 2018, Standard & Poor's removed Mattel from credit watch with negative implications and affirmed Mattel's long-term credit rating of BB-, with a negative outlook.
Financial Position
Mattel’s cash and equivalents decreased $484.7 million to $594.5 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the net loss for the year, excluding non-cash charges, and net repayments of long-term borrowings of $278.2 million.
Accounts receivable decreased $154.6 million to $970.1 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2017. Inventory decreased $57.8 million to $542.9 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $600.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily as a result of lower sales volume and improved collections. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to efforts to tightly manage inventory.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $122.0 million to $1.24 billion at December 31, 2018, as compared to 1.36 billion at December 31, 2017. The decline was primarily due to the timing and amount of payments for various liabilities, including advertising and taxes other than income taxes.
As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, Mattel had $4.2 million and $0, respectively, of short-term borrowings outstanding.
A summary of Mattel’s capitalization is as follows:

Total debt decreased by approximately $267 million to $2.86 billion at December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.12 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to repayment of $250.0 million of the 2013 Senior Notes due March 2018 and $500.0 million of the 2014 Senior Notes due May 2019, partially offset by the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due December 31, 2025 ("2018 Senior Notes").
Stockholders’ equity decreased $590.3 million to $656.8 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the net loss for the year.

45

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Mattel is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business and may choose to provide letters of credit in place of posting cash collateral. Although the letters of credit are off-balance sheet, the majority of the obligations in which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $90 million as of December 31, 2018.
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt agreements and contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattel’s right to create and market certain products and for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery. These arrangements include commitments for future inventory and service purchases and royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the terms of the contracts. Mattel also has defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which require future cash contributions and benefit payments. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used, which contain minimum rental payments.
The following table summarizes Mattel’s contractual commitments and obligations:

(a) Represents total obligation, including minimal imputed interest.

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Due to the uncertainty about the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits, Mattel is not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities.

Litigation
The content of Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation" is hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 7.

Effects of Inflation
Inflation rates in the U.S. and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during 2018, 2017, or 2016. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability, under certain circumstances and at certain times, to pass on higher prices to its customers.

46

Employee Savings Plan
Mattel sponsors a 401(k) savings plan, the Mattel, Inc. Personal Investment Plan (the "Plan"), for its domestic employees. Contributions to the Plan include voluntary contributions by eligible employees and employer automatic and matching contributions by Mattel. The Plan allows employees to allocate both their voluntary contributions and their employer automatic and matching contributions to a variety of investment funds, including a fund that is invested in Mattel common stock (the "Mattel Stock Fund"). Employees are not required to allocate any of their Plan account balance to the Mattel Stock Fund, allowing employees to limit or eliminate their exposure to market changes in Mattel’s stock price. Furthermore, the Plan limits the percentage of the employee’s total account balance that may be allocated to the Mattel Stock Fund to 25%. Employees may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. However, pursuant to Mattel’s insider trading policy, employees classified as insiders and restricted personnel under Mattel’s insider trading policy are limited to certain periods in which they may make allocations into or out of the Mattel Stock Fund.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those Mattel considers most critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures included below. These accounting policies and estimates include significant judgments made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. As described below, however, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used instead.
For a summary of Mattel’s significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of Mattel’s consolidated financial statements, see Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." In most instances, Mattel must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").
Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a "critical accounting estimate" because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including other selling and administrative expenses, net income, and accounts receivable. In addition, the allowance requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors in relation to its customers’ ability to pay amounts owed to Mattel.
Mattel’s products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets and, to a limited extent, wholesalers, and directly to consumers. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.
In recent years, the mass-market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. Mattel’s sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral and are highly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to the seasonal nature of toy sales, which results in a substantial portion of trade receivables being collected during the latter half of the year and the first quarter of the following year. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattel’s exposure to losses from bad debts.
A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattel’s net sales and accounts receivable. In 2018, Mattel’s two largest customers, Walmart and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 34% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 49% of net sales. As of December 31, 2018, Mattel’s two largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of net accounts receivable, and its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 49% of net accounts receivable. The concentration of Mattel’s business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattel’s large customers were to experience financial difficulty.

Mattel has procedures to mitigate its risk of exposure to losses from bad debts. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer. Extensive evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of each customer’s financial performance, cash generation, financing availability, and liquidity status. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews being performed, if necessary, based on the customers’ financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit. Customers’ terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the results of the review. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, factoring, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.
The following table summarizes Mattel’s allowance for doubtful accounts:

-------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ---- ----------------- --- ----------------- ---- --- - - ----

 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
 (In millions, except percentage information)
Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 22.0 $ 25.4 $ 21.4
As a percentage of total accounts receivable 2.2 % 2.2 % 1.9 %

Mattel’s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the business environment, customers’ financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts reflect management’s assessment of the factors noted above, including past due accounts, disputed balances with customers, and the financial condition of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off.
Mattel believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2018 is adequate and proper. However, as described above, Mattel’s business is greatly dependent on a small number of customers. Should one or more of Mattel’s major customers experience liquidity problems, the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover such losses. Any incremental bad debt charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattel’s business segments.
Inventories—Allowance for Obsolescence
Inventories, net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess, and slow-moving inventory. Inventory allowances are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for obsolescence is a "critical accounting estimate" because changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial measures, including gross profit, net income, and inventories. As more fully described below, valuation of Mattel’s inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences, demand for product, or changes in the buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and inventory management of customers.
In the toy industry, orders are typically subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line, which would require management to record a valuation adjustment on such inventory.
Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, who usually request delivery within three months. In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel’s business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase inventory valuation risk since Mattel’s inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed.

48

When current conditions in the domestic and global economies become uncertain, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts of the economy, including the economies in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattel’s budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, economic uncertainty makes estimates of future demand for product more difficult. Such economic changes may affect the sales of Mattel’s products and its corresponding inventory levels, which could potentially impact the valuation of its inventory.
At the end of each quarter, management within each business segment, North America, International, and American Girl, performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item-by-item basis and identifies products that are believed to be impaired. Management assesses the need for, and the amount of, an obsolescence reserve based on the following factors:

- ---------------------------------------------
• Customer and/or consumer demand for the item;

- --------------------------------------------------
• Overall inventory positions of Mattel’s customers;

- ---------------------------------------------
• Strength of competing products in the market;

- -----------------------------
• Quantity on hand of the item;

- ------------------------
• Sales price of the item;

- -------------------------------
• Mattel’s cost for the item; and

- ----------------------------------------------
• Length of time the item has been in inventory.

The timeframe between when an estimate is made and the time of disposal depends on the above factors and may vary significantly. Generally, slow-moving inventory is liquidated during the next annual selling cycle.
The following table summarizes Mattel’s obsolescence reserve:

---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ---- ----------------- ---- ----------------- ----- --- - - ----

 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
 (In millions, except percentage information)
Allowance for obsolescence $ 47.2 $ 118.4 $ 36.8
As a percentage of total inventory 8.2 % 16.8 % 5.5 %

Management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at December 31, 2018 is adequate and proper. However, the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary. Any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of one or more of Mattel’s business segments. During 2017, Mattel recorded obsolescence expense of $58.3 million, $22.4 million, and $46.9 million in the North America, International, and American Girl segments, respectively, due to a decline in 2017 sales and expected demand and the discontinuation of certain product lines.
Goodwill and Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
Mattel tests goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to the fair value estimates of its goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets are "critical accounting estimates" because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income, goodwill, and other intangible assets.
Assessing goodwill for impairment involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. For purposes of evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at the operating segment level. Mattel’s reporting units are: (i) North America, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl. Mattel then assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
When the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit’s book value. In the third quarter of 2017, Mattel early adopted ASU 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.

49

When performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, Mattel utilizes the fair value based upon both the discounted cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future (the "Income Approach") and the Market Approach. The Income Approach valuation method requires Mattel to make projections of revenue, operating costs, and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must make an estimate of a weighted-average cost of capital that a market participant would use as a discount rate. Changes in these projections or estimates would impact the estimated fair value, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded. The Market Approach utilizes earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates, and recent comparable market transactions.
In the third quarter of 2018, Mattel performed its annual impairment tests and determined that goodwill was not impaired since each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value. The fair value of the North America and American Girl reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying value. Mattel’s International reporting unit was deemed to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. The estimated fair value was approximately 1.24x its carrying value. The valuation model assumes incremental growth in sales and gross margin from current levels. If Mattel is unable to successfully execute its plans in international markets to achieve further growth in emerging markets, improve gross margin, or has lower-than-expected market demand, goodwill may be impaired.
Testing nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment also involves a high degree of judgment due to the assumptions that underlie the valuation. Mattel had no nonamortizable intangible assets as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Prior to 2018, Mattel evaluated its nonamortizable intangible asset by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value. The fair value was measured using a multi-period excess earnings method, which reflected the incremental after-tax cash flows after deducting the appropriate contributory asset charges.
In the third quarter of 2017, Mattel performed the annual impairment test for its nonamortizable intangible asset as required and determined that the nonamortizable intangible asset was not impaired as the fair value exceeded its carrying value.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Mattel determined a triggering event had occurred due to a change in brand strategy, which resulted in lower forecasted revenue attributable to the nonamortizable intangible asset. As a result, Mattel performed an interim impairment test which determined that the fair value was in excess of its carrying value, with an estimated fair value approximately 1.05x its carrying value. As such, Mattel determined that the intangible asset should no longer be designated as a nonamortizable intangible asset, but should be amortized starting in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Sales Adjustments
Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross sales in the period the related sale is recognized. Sales adjustments for such programs totaled $560.7 million, $632.6 million, and $620.5 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The above-described programs primarily involve fixed amounts or percentages of sales to customers. Accruals for such programs are calculated based on an assessment of customers’ purchases and performance under the programs and any other specified factors. While the majority of sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at period end and do not require estimates, certain of the sales adjustments require management to make estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends, and information from customers. Management believes that the accruals recorded for customer programs as of December 31, 2018 are adequate and proper.
Benefit Plan Assumptions
Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have retirement and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of these companies. See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans."

50

Actuarial valuations are used in determining amounts recognized in the financial statements for certain retirement and other postretirement benefit plans. These valuations incorporate the following significant assumptions:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Weighted-average discount rate to be used to measure future plan obligations and interest cost component of plan income or expense;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Rate of future compensation increases (for defined benefit pension plans);

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded plans); and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Health care cost trend rates (for other postretirement benefit plans).

Management believes that these assumptions are "critical accounting estimates" because significant changes in these assumptions could impact Mattel’s results of operations and financial position. Management believes that the assumptions utilized to record its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on the plans’ experience and advice received from its outside actuaries. Mattel reviews its benefit plan assumptions annually and modifies its assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. The effects of such changes in assumptions are amortized as part of plan income or expense in future periods.
At the end of each fiscal year, Mattel determines the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the benefit plan liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate also impacts the interest cost component of plan income or expense. As of December 31, 2018, Mattel determined the discount rate for its domestic benefit plans used in determining the projected and accumulated benefit obligations to be 4.1%, as compared to 3.4% and 3.9% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In estimating this rate, Mattel reviews rates of return on high-quality corporate bond indices, which approximate the timing and amount of benefit payments. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, the increase in the discount rate from 3.4% to 4.1% would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2019 of $0.2 million.
As a result of the curtailment of Mattel's domestic defined benefit pension plans, the rate of future compensation increase was not applicable for the 2018, 2017, and 2016 benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost calculations.
The long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on management’s expectation of earnings on the assets that secure Mattel’s funded defined benefit pension plans, taking into account the mix of invested assets, the arithmetic average of past returns, economic and stock market conditions and future expectations, and the long-term nature of the projected benefit obligation to which these investments relate. The long-term rate of return is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets that is used in calculating pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred, net of tax, and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income or expense. Mattel’s long-term rate of return used in determining plan expense for its domestic defined benefit pension plans was 6.0% in 2018, as compared to 6.3% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2016. Assuming all other benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase in benefit plan expense during 2019 of $3.1 million.
The health care cost trend rates used by Mattel for its other postretirement benefit plans reflect management’s best estimate of expected claim costs over the next ten years. These trend rates impact the service and interest cost components of plan expense. Rates ranging from 7.3% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2025, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2025 and thereafter, were used in determining plan expense for 2018. These rates are reviewed annually and are estimated based on historical costs for participants in the other postretirement benefit plans as well as estimates based on current economic conditions. As of December 31, 2018, Mattel maintained the health care cost trend rates for its other postretirement benefit plan obligation at 7.0% for participants younger than age 65, and 6.8% for participants age 65 and older. For all participants, the cost trend rates are estimated to reduce to 4.5% by 2025, with rates assumed to stabilize in 2025. Assuming all other postretirement benefit plan assumptions remain constant, a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would result in a minimal increase in benefit plan expense during 2019.
A one percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each future year would result in a minimal impact to the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 and the service and interest cost recognized for 2018.

51

Share-Based Payments
Mattel recognizes the cost of employee share-based payment awards on a straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility, and the expected dividends. With the exception of certain performance options granted in 2018, which are valued using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology, Mattel estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattel’s stock for a period approximating the expected life, the expected dividend yield is based on Mattel’s most recent actual annual dividend payout, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. Management believes that these assumptions are "critical accounting estimates" because significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial measures, including net income.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2018 valued using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology was $4.21. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2018, 2017, and 2016 valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model was $5.46, $3.37, and $4.09, respectively. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options granted:

------------------------ ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- -

 2018 2017 2016
Expected life (in years) 5.1 5.0 5.0
Risk-free interest rate 2.8 % 1.8 % 1.1 %
Volatility factor 33.6 % 27.2 % 25.3 %
Dividend yield — % 4.0 % 4.7 %

The following tables summarizes the sensitivity of valuation assumptions within the calculation of stock option fair values, if all other assumptions are held constant:

------------------------ ----------------------------- - --------------------------------- ----- --

 Increase in Assumption Factor Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value
Expected life (in years) 1 9.9 %
Risk-free interest rate 1 % 5.5 %
Volatility factor 1 % 2.2 %
Dividend yield 1 % (10.0 )%

------------------------ ------------------------------- -- --------------------------------- ----- --

 (Decrease) in Assumption Factor Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value
Expected life (in years) (1) (10.9 )%
Risk-free interest rate (1 )% (5.3 )%
Volatility factor (1 )% (2.2 )%
Dividend yield (1 )% 10.9 %

Mattel recognized compensation expense of $8.4 million, $14.1 million, and $10.5 million for stock options during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which is included within other selling and administrative expenses. Compensation expense recognized related to grants of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), including performance-based restricted stock units ("Performance RSUs"), was $40.5 million, $53.0 million, and $43.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and is also included within other selling and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2018, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $93.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

52

Income Taxes
Mattel accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740—Income Taxes. Mattel’s income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income, U.S. and foreign statutory income tax rates, and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which Mattel operates. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating Mattel’s worldwide uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect Mattel’s consolidated financial statements.
Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in Mattel’s consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in Mattel’s tax returns filed with the taxing authorities. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in Mattel’s tax return, and some are temporary differences that reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in Mattel’s tax returns in future years for which Mattel has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statements of operations. Mattel records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Management evaluates the level of Mattel’s valuation allowances at least annually, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results.
Mattel records unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus, and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattel’s measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits is based on management’s assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more-likely-than-not (a greater than 50 percent likelihood) be realized.
Mattel’s provision for income taxes was $116.2 million in 2018, compared to $553.3 million in 2017. The 2018 income tax provision included a $14.6 million expense related to changes to Mattel's indefinite reinvestment assertion and a $3.7 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings (net of related valuation allowance change). The 2017 income tax provision included a net expense of $457.1 million, primarily related to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2017 on U.S. deferred tax assets that will likely not be realized and a provisional estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattel’s consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements
See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Mattel presents certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures that Mattel presents include currency exchange rate impact and gross sales. Mattel uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Mattel believes that the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors to be able to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of Mattel's results. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

53

Currency Exchange Rate Impact
The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, Mattel calculates the percentage change of period-over-period results at constant currency exchange rates (established as described below) by translating current period and prior period results using these rates. It then determines the currency exchange rate impact percentage by calculating the difference between the percentage change at such constant currency exchange rates and the percentage change at actual exchange rates.
The constant currency exchange rates are determined by Mattel at the beginning of each year and are applied consistently during the year. They are generally different from the actual exchange rates in effect during the current or prior period due to volatility in actual foreign exchange rates. Mattel considers whether any changes to the constant currency rates are appropriate at the beginning of each year. The exchange rates used for these constant currency calculations are generally based on prior year actual exchange rates.
Mattel believes that the disclosure of the percentage impact of foreign currency changes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge Mattel’s current business performance and the longer-term strength of its overall business since foreign currency changes could potentially mask underlying sales trends. The disclosure of the percentage impact of foreign exchange allows investors to calculate the impact on a constant currency basis and also enhances their ability to compare financial results from one period to another.
Gross Sales
Gross sales represent sales to customers, excluding the impact of sales adjustments. Net sales, as reported, include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross sales as a metric for comparing its aggregate, brand, and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel’s business. Changes in gross sales are discussed because, while Mattel records the details of such sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with brands and individual products, making net sales less meaningful. Because sales adjustments are not allocated to individual products, net sales are only presented on a consolidated and segment basis and not on a brand level.
Since sales adjustments are determined by customer rather than at the brand level, Mattel believes that the disclosure of gross sales by brand is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to assess the performance of its underlying brands (e.g., Barbie) and also enhances their ability to compare sales trends over time.
A reconciliation from Mattel's consolidated net sales to its consolidated gross sales is as follows:

Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018. The following table discloses amounts related to Conrail. Purchase price amortization and equity earnings are included in equity earnings of affiliates and all other ...

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 "]:
Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Mattel is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business and may choose to provide letters of credit in place of posting cash collateral. Although the letters of credit are off-balance sheet, the majority of the obligations in which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $90 million as of December 31, 2018.
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into debt agreements and contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattel’s right to create and market which contain minimum rental payments.

Effects of Inflation
Inflation rates in the U.S. and in major foreign countries where Mattel does business have not had a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position during 2018, 2017, or 2016. Mattel receives some protection from the impact of inflation from high turnover of inventories and its ability, under certain circumstances and at certain times, to pass on higher prices to its customers.
