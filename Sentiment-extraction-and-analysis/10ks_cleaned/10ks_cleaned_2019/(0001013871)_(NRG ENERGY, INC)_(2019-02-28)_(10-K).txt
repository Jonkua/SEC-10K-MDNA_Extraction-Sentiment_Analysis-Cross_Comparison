Executive Summary
NRG is an energy company built on dynamic retail brands with diverse generation assets. NRG brings the power of energy to consumers by producing, selling and delivering electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. The Company sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services directly to retail customers under the names "NRG" and "Reliant" and other brand names owned by NRG supported by approximately 23,000(a) MW of generation as of December 31, 2018.
Business Environment
The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in general in 2018 and for the future medium term include:
Commodities Markets — The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers.  In 2018, average natural gas prices at Henry Hub was 1.0% lower than in 2017.
If long-term gas prices decrease, the Company is likely to encounter lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices.  NRG's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation.  To further mitigate this impact, NRG may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "Energy-Related Commodities" in Item 15 — Note 5, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand.  The low-priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production.  If multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term.  Inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses. Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.

 Electricity Prices — The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. An increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Power prices were higher for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016.  ERCOT power prices were higher primarily due to the continued effect of lower reserve margins as a result of asset retirements in the region.  Power prices in East region increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016 primarily driven by higher winter demand and higher natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2018.

 Average Realized Power Price ($/MWh)
 Year Ended December 31 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016
Region 2018 2017 2016 Change % Change %
Texas $ 37.12 $ 33.45 $ 40.49 11 % (17 )%
East/West 43.70 46.48 47.14 (6 )% (1 )%

The average realized power prices for December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, increased in Texas as a result of higher power prices, and decreased in East/West as a result of the roll off of hedges. The average realized power prices for December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 decreased in both Texas and East/West as a result of the roll off of hedges.

Clean Infrastructure Development — Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. In addition, the costs associated with the development of clean infrastructure, such as wind and solar generating facilities, continues to decline. These factors continue to drive increases in the development of clean infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, which may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, Inc., more than 30% of 2018 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon-free resources with wind power contributing 19%. Certainly, subsidies and incentives have contributed to the increase in renewable power sources, but it is also true that customer awareness/preferences have shifted toward sustainable solutions. Alternatively, increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial consumers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.

49

Digitization and Customization — The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed and used by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, consumers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.
Weather — Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG does business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.
Other Factors — A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:

- ---------------------------------------------
• seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;

- ---------------------
• extreme peak demands;

- ---------------------------
• available supply resources;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations

These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:

- -------------------
• weather conditions;

- -----------------
• market liquidity;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;

- ---------------------------------
• local transportation systems; and

- -------------------------------------------------
• the nature and extent of electricity deregulation

 Economic Gross Margin
In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.
Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.
The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin which reflects the Company's current view of reporting segments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contacts that are yet to be settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

58

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.
For the year ended December 31, 2018 the $130 million loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, as well as a decrease in value of open positions as a result of losses on ERCOT heat rate positions due to heat rate expansion. The $144 million gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT heat rate, partially offset by the reversal of acquired gain positions.

In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Gross Margin
The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.
Economic Gross Margin
In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales.
Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.
The tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin which reflects the Company's current view of reporting segments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ---- -

 (In millions)
Lower gross margin due to lower rates to customers driven by customer product, term and mix of $103 million or approximately $1.60 per MWh, partially offset by lower supply cost of $28 million or approximately $0.50 per MWh driven by a decrease in supply costs $ (75 )

The reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the $252 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period, as well as an increase in value of open positions as a result of decreases in gas prices. The $46 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT heat rate.
In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $196 million(a) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and selling and marketing activities as the Company continues to focus on cost management.
 (a) Approximately $98 million of additional cost savings were achieved in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as the savings became permanent through the Transformation Plan
Development Costs
Development costs decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, due to the strategic decision for a more focused development program primarily related to Renewables and the sale of EVgo in 2016.
Gain/(Loss) on Sale of Assets
Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, represents a gain on the sale of land. The loss on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the loss on sale of the Company's majority interest in its EVgo business to Vision Ridge Partners, which resulted in a loss on sale as described in Item 15 — Note 3, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairment Losses on Investments
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded impairment losses of $79 million, which is primarily due to impairments on the Company's interests in Petra Nova Parish Holdings as well as as impairments on other investments as further described in Item 15 — Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

72

Loss on Debt Extinguishment
A loss on debt extinguishment of $49 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the repurchase of Senior Notes at a price above par value and the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the replacement of the 2018 Term Loan Facility with the new 2023 Term Loan Facility.
A loss on debt extinguishment of $142 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the repurchase of NRG senior notes at a price above par value and the write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the replacement of the 2018 Term Loan Facility with the new 2023 Term Loan Facility.
Interest Expense
NRG's interest expense decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower debt balances resulting in less interest.
Income Tax Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2017, NRG recorded an income tax benefit of $44 million on a pre-tax loss of $1,389 million. For the same period in 2016, NRG recorded an income tax expense of $25 million on pre-tax loss of $931 million. The effective tax rate was 3.2% and (2.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to tax expense recorded from the revaluation of the existing net deferred tax asset and state taxes, partially offset by the change in valuation allowance, establishing the AMT credit receivable and the generation of PTCs from various wind facilities. The tax expense recorded for revaluation of the net deferred tax asset is required to reflect the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% in accordance with the Tax Act.

2048 Convertible Senior Notes Issuance
On May 24, 2018, the Company issued $575 million in aggregate principal amount at par of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2048.
First Lien Structure
NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, excluding assets acquired in the EME (including Midwest Generation) acquisitions and NRG's assets that have project-level financing. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to NRG, the counterparty would have claim under the first lien program. The first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity and 10% of its other assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
The Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2018, all hedges under the first liens were out-of-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.

The following table summarizes the amount of MW hedged against the Company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the Company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of December 31, 2018:

The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 — Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering development, and environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, return of capital and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 — Note 14, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commercial Operations
The Company's commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. As of December 31, 2018, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $287 million and $793 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions. As of December 31, 2018, total collateral held from counterparties was $33 million in cash and $108 million of letters of credit.
 Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, power purchases and sales, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.
2023 Term Loan Facility
In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, on October 5, 2018, the Company initiated an asset sale offer to purchase a portion of its Term Loan following the sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. The offer expired on November 5, 2018, and $260 million of Term Loan holders accepted the offer. As a result, the Company prepaid $155 million of Term Loans as part of its de-leveraging plan, as well as established an incremental first lien secured loan term facility under the Senior Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of $105 million on the same terms and conditions to stay within its debt reduction target.
In accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, upon the consummation of the sales of the South Central Portfolio and Carlsbad, the Company will initiate asset sale offers to purchase a portion of its Term Loan. The Company has one year from the date of each sale to initiate the offer.
Senior Note Repurchases in 2018
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company redeemed $1.1 billion in aggregate principal of its Senior Notes for $1.1 billion, which included accrued interest of $14 million. In connection with the redemptions, a $38 million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded in 2018, which included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs of $7 million.

Environmental Capital Expenditures Estimate
NRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2019 through 2023 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $35 million. These costs are primarily associated with the cost of adding NOx controls in Connecticut.
The table below summarizes the status of NRG's coal fleet with respect to air quality controls. Planned investments are either in construction or budgeted in the existing capital expenditures budget. Changes to regulations could result in changes to planned installation dates. NRG uses an integrated approach to fuels, controls and emissions markets to meet environmental standards.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of $468 million and a foreign pre-tax book loss of $1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company generated an NOL of $8.0 billion due to a current year taxable loss. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has cumulative domestic federal NOL carryforwards of $10.7 billion, which will begin expiring in 2031 and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $5.6 billion. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $213 million, which do not have an expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $442 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $381 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the benefit of $9.6 billion of tax losses and worthless stock deduction upon GenOn emerging from bankruptcy, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to $20 million in 2019.
The Company has recorded short-term and long-term receivables of $35 million and $34 million, respectively, representing refundable AMT credits from the IRS, which are anticipated to be received from 2019 through 2022 pursuant to the 50% annual limitation as enacted by the Tax Act upon repeal of corporate AMT effective January 1, 2018. Of this amount, short-term and long-term payables of $11 million each are due to GenOn for their share of minimum tax credits.
In addition to these amounts, the Company has $26 million of tax effected uncertain state tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $30 million (including accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts
NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 — Note 25 Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Retained or Contingent Interests
NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity
Variable interest in Equity investments — As of December 31, 2018, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. One of these investments is considered a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.
NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $992 million as of December 31, 2018. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 — Note 15, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

85

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRG's contractual obligations and contingent obligations for guarantees.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities or retail load obligations. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.
NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2018, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2018. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see Derivative Fair Value Measurements in Item 15 — Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2018, NRG's net derivative asset was $104 million, an increase to total fair value of $1 million as compared to December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value and contracts acquired during the period, largely offset by roll off trades that were settled during the period.
Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $230 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2018.
The impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $221 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2018.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
NRG's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.
On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.
NRG's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 — Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative Instruments
The Company follows the guidance of ASC 815 to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Company's derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.
For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings are based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors. The probability that forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the Company's earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.
Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets
As of December 31, 2018, NRG had a valuation allowance of $3.8 billion. This amount is comprised of domestic federal net deferred tax assets of approximately $3.3 billion, domestic state net deferred tax assets of $454 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $62 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets, requiring a valuation allowance to be recorded.
NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effective December 22, 2017. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, including operations located in Australia.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2015. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2010.
Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;

- -------------------------
• Adverse business climate;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life

89

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.
For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under ASC 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability-weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.
Annually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long term power and fuel prices impacted the Company’s projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its annual budget and revised its view of long-term power and fuel prices and the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lived assets. There were no significant changes to the Company's long-term view of natural gas prices despite management's expectation of continued trends towards more renewables and energy storage. There were minimal changes to the long-term view of energy and capacity prices, which did not have a significant negative impact on the Company's coal, nuclear, and renewable facilities.
The following long-lived asset impairment was recorded during 2018, as further described in Item 15 —Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the consolidated financial statements:
Guam— During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company concluded its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRG Solar Guam, LLC, was held for sale after board approval and advanced negotiations to sell the business. Accordingly, the Company recorded the assets and liabilities at fair market value as of December 31, 2018 based on the contractual sale price, which resulted in an impairment loss of $12 million. The sale was completed on February 20, 2019.
Keystone and Conemaugh — On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its approximately 3.7% interests in the Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations. The Company recorded impairment losses of $14 million for Keystone and $14 million for Conemaugh to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to fair value based on the contractual sale price. The transaction closed on September 5, 2018.
Dunkirk — During the second quarter of 2018, NRG ceased its development of the project to add gas capability at the Dunkirk generating station. The project was put on hold in 2015 pending the resolution of a lawsuit filed by Entergy Corporation against the NYPSC, which challenged the legality of its contract with Dunkirk. The lawsuit was later dropped and development continued, but the delay imposed a new requirement on Dunkirk to enter into the NYISO interconnection study process. The NYISO studies have concluded that extensive electric system upgrades would be necessary for the station to return to service. This would cause the Company to incur a material increase in cost and delay the project schedule that would render the project impractical. Consequently, the Company has recorded an impairment loss of $46 million, reducing the carrying amount of the related assets to $0.
Other Impairments — As of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded additional impairment losses of approximately $13 million. These impairment losses were primarily to record the value of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at fair market value at the date of sale or in connection with an impairment indicator.

90

Equity and Cost Method Investments — NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an other-than-temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded impairment losses on its equity method investments of $15 million due to declines in value.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At December 31, 2018, NRG reported goodwill of $573 million, consisting of $165 million associated with the acquisition of Midwest Generation and $408 million for retail business acquisitions. The balance of goodwill increased by $34 million in 2018 due to the acquisition of XOOM.
 The Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, and ASC 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.
The Company performed its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the NRG Business Solutions and Commodity Retail reporting units. The Company determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these reporting units were more than their carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Company performed a quantitative assessment for the reporting units in the following table. The Company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as of December 31, 2018:

--------------------------------------- -------------------------------- -

Reporting Unit % Fair Value Over Carrying Value
Midwest Generation (Generation Segment) 132 %
Texas Non-Commodity (Retail Segment) 135 %

The Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in its quantitative assessment are consistent with the views of market participants. Significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term forecasts for all of the plants in the region. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The Company's views of power and fuel prices consider market prices for the first five-year period and the Company's fundamental view for the longer term, driven by the Company's long-term view of the price of natural gas. The Company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied power price and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;

91

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The Company's estimate of generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and the existing and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The Company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term forecasts is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market. The dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the Texas Non-Commodity reporting unit. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs: a terminal value utilizing assumed growth rates and discount rates that reflect the inherent cash flow risk for each reporting unit.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
Contingencies
NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.

Natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand.  The low-priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production.  If multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term.  Inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses. Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, India, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. In August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments.

Retail gross margin increased $277 million and retail economic gross margin increased $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ---

 (In millions)
Higher gross margin driven by margin enhancement initiatives enhancing customer product, retention, term and mix of $3.30 per MWh, or $208 million partially offset by higher supply costs due to increased power prices in ERCOT of $2.40 MWh, or $150 million. $ 58
Higher gross margin due to higher volumes from net higher average customer counts primarily driven by XOOM acquisition in June 2018 60
Higher gross margin from the favorable impact of weather due to $44 million from an increase in load in 2018 of 1,893,000 MWh partially offset by an unfavorable impact of $14 million from selling back additional excess supply in 2018 as well as $16 million due to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 46
Higher gross margin due to an increase in capacity revenues from the business solutions unit mainly due to approximately 1,600 additional MWs sold and margin enhancements from the sale of additional capacity of $11 million 36
Increase in economic gross margin $ 200
Increase in mark-to-market for economic hedging primarily due to net unrealized gains/losses on open positions related to economic hedges 76

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contacts that are yet to be settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.

58
