Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further discussion.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We record Cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk of loss of principal amounts invested and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We consider to be cash equivalents all short-term marketable securities with remaining days to maturity of 90 days or less from the purchase date that can be readily converted to cash.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents

Amounts included in restricted cash represent cash on hand required to be set aside by a contractual agreement related to receivable factoring arrangements and deferred compensation plans and are included in the Other current assets caption on our consolidated balance sheets. Generally, the restrictions related to the factoring arrangements lapse at the time we remit the customer payments collected by us as servicer of previously sold customer receivables to the purchaser. Restrictions for deferred compensation lapse when amounts are paid to the employee. Restricted cash equivalents primarily represent amounts paid into various qualified settlement funds related to our ongoing transvaginal surgical mesh litigation and current amounts related to our non-qualified pension plan and are included in the Other current assets caption on our consolidated balance sheets. The restrictions related to the various qualified settlement funds will lapse as we approve amounts payable to claimants, at which time we no longer have rights to a return of the amounts paid into the various qualified settlement funds. Restricted cash equivalents included in the Other long-term assets caption on our consolidated balance sheets are related to the long-term portion of our non-qualified pension plan and deferred compensation plans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts and notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure. In the normal course, our payment terms with customers, including hospitals, healthcare agencies, clinics, doctors' offices and other private and governmental institutions, are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets and generally do not require collateral. We record our Accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, based on historical information and management's best estimates. We write-off amounts determined to be uncollectible against this reserve. Write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable were immaterial in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We are not dependent on any single institution, and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our U.S. net sales.

We closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our European sales to government-owned or supported customers in Southern Europe, specifically Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment. Historically, receivable balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals in these countries accumulated over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. While we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers, and our write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable may increase.

Revenue Recognition

ASC Update No. 2014-09

In May 2014, the FASB issued FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was subsequently updated. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, we applied FASB ASC Topic 606 to contracts that were not complete as of January 1, 2018 and recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606. Prior period amounts are not adjusted and are reported in accordance with legacy GAAP requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.

Due to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606, we recorded a net reduction to retained earnings of $177 million on January 1, 2018, primarily related to the cost of providing non-contractual post-implant support to certain customers, which we historically deemed immaterial in the context of the arrangement. Upon the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606, when we sell a device with an implied non-contractual post-implant support obligation, we forward accrue the cost of the service within Selling, general and administrative expenses and recognize it at the point in time the associated revenue is earned. We release the accrual over the related service period. These costs were previously expensed as incurred due to such service obligation being non-contractual.

The impact of adopting FASB ASC Topic 606 on our consolidated balance sheets resulted in an increase in Other current liabilities of $59 million and an increase in Other long-term liabilities of $205 million as of December 31, 2018, as a result of accruing for our post-implant support obligation. We also recorded deferred tax assets primarily related to post-implant support, resulting in an increase in Other long-term assets of $12 million and a reduction in Deferred income taxes of $41 million as of December 31, 2018. The remaining impact of adopting FASB ASC Topic 606 was not material to our financial position or results of operations.

We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. In certain international markets, we sell our products through independent distributors. We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,

- ---------------------------------------------
• Promised products or services are identified,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have transferred control of the promised items to the customer.

Transfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless we are required to provide additional services. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs as a selling expense when incurred. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets.

Deferred Revenue

We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Contract liabilities are classified within Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our contractual liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred.

Variable Consideration

We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.

We also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above.

Capitalized Contract Costs

We capitalize commission fees related to contracts with customers when the associated revenue is expected to be earned over a period that exceeds one year. Deferred commissions are primarily related to the sale of devices enabled with our LATITUDE Patient Management System. We have elected to expense commission costs when incurred for contracts with an expected duration of one year or less. Capitalized commission fees are amortized over the period the associated products or services are transferred. Similarly, we capitalize certain recoverable costs related to the delivery of the LATITUDE Remote Monitoring Service. These fulfillment costs are amortized over the average service period. Our total capitalized contract costs are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.

Post Implant Services

We provide non-contractual services to customers to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. Since our modified retrospective adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, because the revenue related to the immaterial services is recognized before they are delivered, we forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold. We record these costs to Selling, general and administrative expenses. We estimate the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost.

Warranty Obligations

We offer warranties on certain of our product offerings. The majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our CRM business, which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems. Our CRM products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices. We offer a full warranty for a portion of the period post-implant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter. We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessary. Aggregate year over year changes in our product warranty accrual during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were immaterial.

Inventories

We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value. We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory. Approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representatives.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant, equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset. We provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over a maximum life of 40 years; building improvements over the remaining useful life of the building structure; equipment, furniture and fixtures over a three to seven year life; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease.

Valuation of Business Combinations

We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D), which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate to goodwill any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through Selling, general and administrative expenses.

In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through Contingent consideration expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones after the acquisition date, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets and/or obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development at the date of the acquisition.

Indefinite-lived Intangibles, including IPR&D

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, include acquired balloon and other technology, which is foundational to our ongoing operations within the Cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Our IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We classify IPR&D acquired in a business combination as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, we write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset.

We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or impairment indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.

We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our IPR&D. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of other acquired assets, the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology. See Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information related to indefinite-lived intangibles, including IPR&D.

For asset purchases outside of business combinations, we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date.

Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets

We record definite-lived intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows: patents and licenses, two to 20 years; amortizable technology-related and customer relationships, five to 25 years; other intangible assets, various.

We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset or asset group, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period impairment is identified.

We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset or asset group. See Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets.

For patents developed internally, we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents, including attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual impairment assessment, we identified seven reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. We aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350. These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.

In performing the goodwill impairment assessments for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we utilized both the optional qualitative assessment and the quantitative approach prescribed under FASB ASC Topic 350. The qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. All other reporting units were tested using the quantitative approach described below. The qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. After assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further steps are required. If it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the quantitative impairment test. In 2018, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation reporting units since their fair values have exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. The remaining reporting units were quantitatively tested for impairment. For all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, no further steps were required, and we concluded such reporting units were not impaired. For all reporting units tested using the quantitative approach, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.

For our 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual impairment assessments, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.

In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our Discounted Cash Flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows.

Refer to Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to our goodwill balances.

Investments in Publicly Traded and Privately Held Entities

ASC Update No. 2016-01

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose of Update No. 2016-01 is to improve financial reporting for financial instruments by reducing the number of items recorded to other comprehensive income. We adopted Update No. 2016-01 in the first quarter of 2018, using both the modified retrospective and prospective methods. For publicly-held securities, we used the modified retrospective approach. Unrealized gains and losses previously recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss) were reclassified to retained earnings, and all future fair value changes will be recorded to Net income (loss). For privately-held securities that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, we elected the measurement alternative approach for our existing investments, which is applied prospectively upon adoption. This approach requires entities to measure their investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. The actual impact to future periods resulting from fair value changes of our equity investments is difficult to predict as it will depend on their future performance.

In 2017 and 2016, we accounted for our publicly traded investments as available-for-sale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period. Unrealized holding gains or losses during the period, net of tax, were recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We computed realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities at fair value, adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. We accounted for investments in private entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 325, Investments - Other.

We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. We record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements. Lastly, we have notes receivable from certain companies that we account for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Refer to Note B Acquisitions and Strategic Investments for additional details on our investment balances.

Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Examples of such impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, recent financing rounds at reduced valuations, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investee s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers financial information related to the investee available to us, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value if accounted for under measurement alternative. For our equity method investments, an impairment loss is recorded if we determine the impairment is other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary unless available evidence indicates that the valuation is more likely than not to recover up to the carrying value of the investment in a reasonable period of time, and we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time needed to recover the value. For other-than-temporary impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value. Impairment losses on our investments are included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

ASC Update No. 2016-16

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The purpose of Update No. 2016-16 is to allow an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, as opposed to waiting until the asset is sold to a third party, or impaired. Update No. 2016-16 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted Update No. 2016-16 prospectively in the first quarter of 2018 and recognized a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $55 million for income tax consequences not previously recognized for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventories. All future income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventories will be recognized through Income tax expense (benefit).

We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as estimates of the impact of future taxable income and available prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. As part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), we are subject to a territorial tax system in which we are required to make an accounting policy in providing for tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to treat the impact of GILTI as a period cost and will be reported as a part of continuing operations. See Note I - Income Taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances including a discussion of the impacts of the TCJA.

Legal and Product Liability Costs

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue our best estimate of the minimum amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement. We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit. We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as Litigation-related charges (credits) in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note J Commitments and Contingencies for discussion of our individual material legal proceedings.

Costs Associated with Exit Activities

We record employee termination costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 712, Compensation - Nonretirement and Postemployment Benefits, if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement, which includes benefits provided as part of our established severance policies or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements. We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested, the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We account for employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. We record such costs into expense over the employee s future service period, if any.

Other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs, including costs related to consultant fees and contract cancellations. The costs are expensed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420 and FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment and are included in Restructuring charges (credits) in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives, including program management costs, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs and costs to transfer product lines among facilities are included within Costs of products sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note G Restructuring-related Activities for further information and discussion of our restructuring plans.

Translation of Foreign Currency

We translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries from the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate and translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. We show the net effect of these translation adjustments in our consolidated financial statements as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. For any significant foreign subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, we would re-measure their financial statements as if the functional currency were the U.S. dollar. We recorded immaterial highly inflationary economy translation adjustments in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of operations, net of losses and gains from any related derivative financial instruments.

Financial Instruments

ASC Update No. 2017-12

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The purpose of Update No. 2017-12 is to simplify the application of hedge accounting and better align financial reporting of hedging relationships with risk management objectives. Update No. 2017-12 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. We early adopted Update No. 2017-12 in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

We recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our financial statements. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for, and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, as well as on the type of hedging relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset gains and losses on the item being hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes, and we do not have any non-derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 815. Refer to Note D Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements for more information on our derivative instruments.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We generally do not bill customers for shipping and handling of our products. We treat shipping and handling costs incurred after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs were $124 million in 2018, $110 million in 2017 and $101 million in 2016.

Research and Development

We expense research and development costs, including new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research as incurred. Refer to Indefinite-lived Intangibles, including In-Process Research and Development above for our policy regarding IPR&D acquired in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases.

Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

We base Net income (loss) per common share upon the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during each year. Potential common stock equivalents are determined using the treasury stock method. We exclude stock options and stock awards whose effect would be anti-dilutive from the calculation.

NOTE K STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue 50 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, option or other rights thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

Common Stock

We are authorized to issue 2.000 billion shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by our Board of Directors and to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, or conversion rights. The holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. The holders of a majority of the shares of common stock can elect all of the directors and can control our management and affairs.

On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.000 billion of our common stock. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had remaining $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Subsequent Events

We evaluate events occurring after the date of our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for potential recognition or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements. We did not identify any material subsequent events requiring adjustment to our accompanying consolidated financial statements (recognized subsequent events). Those items requiring disclosure (unrecognized subsequent events) in the consolidated financial statements have been disclosed accordingly. Refer to Note B Acquisitions and Strategic Investments, Note D Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements and Note J Commitments and Contingencies for further details.

Accounting Estimates

To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further discussion.
