Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further discussion.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We record Cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk of loss of principal amounts invested and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We consider to be cash equivalents all short-term marketable securities with remaining days to maturity of 90 days or less from the purchase date that can be readily converted to cash.

Restricted Cash

Amounts included in restricted cash represent cash on hand required to be set aside by a contractual agreement related to receivable factoring arrangements and deferred compensation plans and are included in the Other current assets caption within our consolidated balance sheets. Generally, the restrictions related to the factoring arrangements lapse at the time we remit the
customer payments collected by us for servicing previously sold customer receivables to the purchaser. Restrictions for deferred compensation lapse when amounts are paid to the employee.

Restricted Cash EquivalentsRestricted cash equivalents primarily represent amounts paid into various qualified settlement funds related to our ongoing transvaginal surgical mesh litigation and current amounts related to our non-qualified pension plan and are included in the Other current assets caption within our consolidated balance sheets. The restrictions related to the various qualified settlement funds will lapse as we approve amounts payable to claimants, at which time we no longer have rights to a return of the amounts paid into the various qualified settlement funds. Restricted cash equivalents included in the Other long-term assets caption within our consolidated balance sheets are related to deferred compensation plans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts and notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure. In the normal course, our payment terms with customers, including hospitals, healthcare agencies, clinics, doctors' offices and other private and governmental institutions, are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets and generally do not require collateral.

We record credit loss reserves to Allowance for credit losses when we establish Trade accounts receivable if credit losses are expected over the asset's contractual life. We base our estimates of credit loss reserves on historical experience and adjust, as necessary, to reflect current conditions using reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information. We utilize an accounts receivable aging approach to determine the reserve to record at accounts receivable commencement for certain customers, applying country or region-specific factors. In performing the assessment of outstanding accounts receivable, regardless of country or region, we may consider significant factors relevant to collectability, including those specific to a customer such as bankruptcy, lengthy average payment cycles and type of account.

We write-off amounts determined to be uncollectible against this reserve. Write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable were immaterial in 2020, 2019 and 2018. We are not dependent on any single institution, and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks, international distributors and dealers and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our sales to government-owned or supported customers, particularly in southern Europe, are subject to an increased number of days outstanding prior to payment relative to other countries. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated an ongoing site-of-service trend of shifting procedure volumes toward non-hospital settings, particularly ambulatory surgery centers, driven by considerations surrounding costs, reimbursement policies, advances in minimally invasive treatments and remote patient monitoring. We have seen an increase in the volume of our U.S. business conducted in ambulatory surgery centers. Many of these customers are smaller than those we have historically done business with and may have limited liquidity. While certain ambulatory surgery centers are performing an increasing number of procedures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, others have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and mitigation measures. We have adjusted our estimates of credit loss reserves for these customers, regions and conditions, as appropriate. We believe our Allowance for credit losses is adequate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019; however, if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of government customers, or if there is an increase in bankruptcies among our ambulatory surgery center customers, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers, and our write-offs of uncollectible accounts may increase.

Revenue Recognition

We sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. In certain international markets, we sell our products through independent distributors or dealers. We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

•We have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,
•Promised products or services are identified,
•The transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and
•We have transferred control of the promised items to the customer.

Transfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless we are required to provide additional services. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs as a selling expense when incurred. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets.

Deferred Revenue

We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm Management product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, within our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business, which represents a future service obligation. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.

Contract liabilities are classified within Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our contractual liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity. Our contractual liabilities also include deferred revenue related to the LUX-Dx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) system, also within our CRM business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device longevity and usage. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred.

Variable Consideration

We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.

We also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above.

Post-Implant Services

We provide non-contractual services to customers to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. Because the revenue related to the immaterial services is recognized before they are delivered, we forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold. We record these costs to Selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost.

Warranty Obligations

We offer warranties on certain of our product offerings. The majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our CRM business, which include implantable defibrillator and pacemaker systems. These products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices. We offer a full warranty for a portion of the period post-implant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter. We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessary.

Inventories

We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value. We utilize a standard costing system, capitalizing variances between estimated and actual production costs during periods of normal production, and amortize to Cost of products sold over inventory turns. We expense manufacturing variances during periods of abnormal production, or less than 75 percent of manufacturing capacity. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $149 million of abnormal manufacturing variances attributable to lower production levels resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and lower than forecasted demand for our products. We did not record any abnormal production variances during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.
 149000000

Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant, equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset. We provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over a maximum life of 40 years; building improvements over the remaining useful life of the building structure; equipment, furniture and fixtures over a three to seven year life; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease.

Valuation of Business Combinations

We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D), which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate to goodwill any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through Selling, general and administrative expenses.

In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through Contingent consideration net expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones after the acquisition date, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets and/or obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development at the date of the acquisition.

Indefinite-lived Intangibles and IPR&D

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, include acquired balloon and other technology, which is foundational to our ongoing operations within our Cardiovascular and MedSurg businesses, and IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Our IPR&D represents intangible assets that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We classify IPR&D as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, we write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset.

We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for classification and impairment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.

We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our IPR&D. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of other acquired assets, the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology. See Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information related to indefinite-lived intangibles, including IPR&D.For asset purchases outside of business combinations, we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date.

Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets

We record definite-lived intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows: patents and licenses, two to 20 years; amortizable technology-related and customer relationships, five to 25 years; other intangible assets, various.

We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset or asset group, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period impairment is identified.

We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset or asset group. See Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets.For patents developed internally, we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents, including attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances in the second quarter of each year as of April 1 for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist.

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2020 annual impairment assessment, we identified the following reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health, Neuromodulation and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. We aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.

In the second quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the qualitative assessment approach to test all of our reporting units. We assessed recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors since the most recently performed quantitative test. After assessing the totality of events, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units has sufficient excess over its carrying value, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired or at risk of impairment.

On December 1, 2020, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell our Specialty Pharmaceuticals business (disposal group) for a purchase price of $800 million, subject to certain adjustments including cash on hand as of the closing date of the transaction. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. We acquired our Specialty Pharmaceuticals business in conjunction with the BTG acquisition on August 19, 2019. In connection with the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the disposal group for a specified amount, we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in a goodwill impairment of $73 million. As of December 31, 2020, we classified the remaining assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets at their respective carrying values, which approximates fair value, less cost to sell. Refer to Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to our goodwill balances.

Investments in Publicly Traded and Privately Held Entities

For publicly-held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we measure at fair value with changes in fair value recognized currently in Other, net within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For privately-held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we apply the measurement alternative approach and measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any, observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. We record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements. Lastly, we have notes receivable from certain companies that we account for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments for additional details on our investment balances.

Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Examples of such impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, recent financing rounds at reduced valuations, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers financial information related to the investee available to us, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. For our investments for which we apply the measurement alternative, if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. For our equity method investments, if we determine an impairment is other-than-temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary unless available evidence indicates that the valuation is more likely than not to recover up to the carrying value of the investment in a reasonable period of time, and we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for at least the period of time needed to recover the value. Net gains and losses and impairments associated with our investment portfolio are included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
 Income TaxesWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as estimates of the impact of future taxable income and available prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), we are subject to a territorial tax system in which we are required to establish an accounting policy in providing for tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to treat the impact of GILTI as a period cost and report it as part of continuing operations. See Note J – Income Taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances including a discussion of the impacts of the TCJA

Legal and Product Liability Costs

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue our best estimate of the minimum amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement. We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit. We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as Litigation-related charges (credits) in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. See Note K – Commitments and Contingencies for discussion of our individual material legal proceedings.

Costs Associated with Exit Activities

We record employee termination costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 712, Compensation - Nonretirement and Postemployment Benefits, if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement, which includes benefits provided as part of our established severance policies or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements. We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested, the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We account for involuntary employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. We record such costs into expense over the employee’s future service period, if any.

Other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs and consulting fees, which are expensed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420 and are included in Restructuring net charges (credits) in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives, including program management costs, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs and costs to transfer product lines among facilities are included within Costs of products sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of right of use lease assets and lease termination costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives are expensed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842 and included within Costs of products sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note H – Restructuring-related Activities for further information and discussion of our restructuring plans.

Translation of Foreign Currency

We translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries from the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate. We show the net effect of these translation adjustments in our consolidated financial statements as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. For any significant foreign subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, we would re-measure their financial statements as if the functional currency were the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other, net in our consolidated statements of operations, net of losses and gains from any related derivative financial instruments.

Financial Instruments

We recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our financial statements. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for, and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, as well as on the type of hedging relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset gains and losses on the item being hedged, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Refer to Note E – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements for more information on our hedging instruments.

 Shipping and Handling CostsWe generally do not bill customers for shipping and handling of our products. We treat shipping and handling costs incurred after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record in Selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs were $146 million in 2020, $144 million in 2019 and $124 million in 2018
 146000000
 144000000
 124000000

Research and Development

We expense research and development (R&D) costs, including new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research as incurred. Refer to Indefinite-lived Intangibles and IPR&D above for our policy regarding R&D projects acquired in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases.

NOTE B – ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results for acquired entities from the respective dates of acquisition. We did not complete any material acquisitions during 2020. We have not presented supplemental pro forma financial information for prior acquisitions given their results are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Transaction costs for all acquisitions completed during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements and were expensed as incurred. In 2020, we recorded immaterial purchase price adjustments during the measurement period for the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with prior acquisitions.

On January 21, 2021, we announced our entrance into a definitive agreement to acquire Preventice Solutions, Inc. (Preventice), a privately-held company which offers a full portfolio of mobile cardiac health solutions and services, ranging from ambulatory cardiac monitors, to cardiac event monitors and mobile cardiac telemetry. We have been an investor in Preventice since 2015 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately 22 percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in a net cash payment of approximately $720 million upon closing and up to an additional $230 million payment upon achievement of a commercial milestone. The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of 2021, subject to customary
closing conditions. Following the closing of the acquisition, the Preventice business will be managed by our Cardiac Rhythm Management division.

2019 Acquisitions

BTG plc

On August 19, 2019, we announced the closing of our acquisition of BTG plc (BTG), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. BTG had three key portfolios, the largest of which is its interventional medicine portfolio (Interventional Medicine) that encompasses interventional oncology therapeutic technologies for patients with liver and kidney cancers, as well as a vascular portfolio for treatment of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous obstruction and superficial venous disease. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated BTG's Interventional Medicine business into our Peripheral Interventions division.

In addition to the Interventional Medicine product lines, the BTG portfolio also included a specialty pharmaceutical business (Specialty Pharmaceuticals) comprised of acute care antidotes to treat overexposure to certain medications and toxins. On December 1, 2020, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell our Specialty Pharmaceuticals business (disposal group) for a purchase price of $800 million , subject to certain adjustments including cash on hand as of the closing date of the transaction. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Refer to Note C – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for additional information.

The BTG portfolio further included a licensing portfolio (Licensing arrangements) that generated net royalties related to BTG intellectual property and product license agreements. In connection with the acquisition, we acquired rights to future royalties associated with the Zytiga™ Drug used to treat certain forms of prostate cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our rights to these royalties for $256 million in cash, included in Proceeds from royalty rights transfer in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note E – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements for additional information.

The transaction price for the acquisition of BTG consisted of upfront cash in the aggregate amount of £3.312 billion (or $4.023 billion based on the exchange rate at closing on August 19, 2019) for the entire issued ordinary share capital of BTG, whereby BTG stockholders received 840 pence (or $10.20 based on the exchange rate at closing) in cash for each BTG share. The transaction price included $404 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. We implemented our acquisition of BTG by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006, as amended.

Purchase Price Allocation

We accounted for the acquisition of BTG as a business combination, and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, (FASB ASC Topic 805), we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The final purchase price was comprised of the following components:

(in millions)
--------------------------------------------- - -----
Payment for acquisition, net of cash acquired $ 3,619

The final purchase price allocation was comprised of the following components:

(in millions)
---------------------------------------------- ----- -----
Goodwill $ 1,635
Trade accounts receivable, net 108
Inventories 232

We allocated $1.399 billion to our Peripheral Interventions reporting unit and $236 million to the Specialty Pharmaceuticals reporting unit. In 2020, we recorded Goodwill impairment charges of $73 million related to our Specialty Pharmaceuticals business. Refer to Note A – Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Transaction with Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

On August 21, 2019, we completed the sale of our drug-eluting and bland embolic microsphere portfolio to Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (Varian) in connection with our acquisition of BTG. The transaction price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $90 million, a portion of which is allocated to the fair value of the services to be rendered under the Transition Services Agreement and Transition Manufacturing Agreement entered into with Varian as part of this transaction. Additionally, we transferred certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from our initial acquisition of the portfolio to Varian and agreed to indemnify Varian for any payments ultimately arising under the terms of the contingent consideration arrangement. Accordingly, as part of the disposal, we recorded a liability of $16 million to recognize the fair value of this guarantee based on our potential obligation resulting from the indemnifications. The maximum amount payable under this guarantee is $200 million in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 460, Guarantees, which is consistent with the contingent consideration arrangement executed with our initial acquisition of the portfolio in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805.
Vertiflex, Inc.

On June 11, 2019, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Vertiflex, Inc. (Vertiflex), a privately-held company which developed and commercialized the Superion™ Indirect Decompression System, a minimally-invasive device used to improve physical function and reduce pain in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The transaction price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $465 million and contingent payments that are based on a percentage of Vertiflex sales growth in the first three years following the acquisition close. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the sales-based contingent payments to be in a range of zero to $100 million; however, the payments are uncapped over the three year earn-out period. Through December 31, 2020, we have made incremental payments of $20 million to the prior shareholders of Vertiflex in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the Vertiflex business into our Neuromodulation division.

Millipede, Inc.

On January 29, 2019, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Millipede, Inc. (Millipede), a privately-held company that has developed the IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for the treatment of severe mitral regurgitation. We were an investor in Millipede since the first quarter of 2018 as part of an investment and acquisition option agreement, whereby we purchased a portion of the outstanding shares of Millipede, along with newly issued shares of the company, for an upfront cash payment of $90 million. In the fourth quarter of 2018, upon the successful completion of a first-in-human clinical study, we exercised our option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede. We held an interest of approximately 20 percent immediately prior to the acquisition date. We remeasured the fair value of our previously-held investment based on the implied enterprise value and allocation of purchase price consideration according to priority of equity interests. The transaction price for the remaining stake consisted of an upfront cash payment of $325 million and up to an additional $125 million payment upon achievement of a commercial milestone. Through December 31, 2020, we have not made any incremental payments to the prior shareholders of Millipede, as the commercial milestone has not yet been achieved. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the Millipede business into our Interventional Cardiology division.

Purchase Price Allocation

We accounted for the acquisitions of Vertiflex and Millipede as business combinations, and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition dates. The final purchase prices were comprised of the following components:

2018 Acquisitions

Augmenix, Inc.

On October 16, 2018, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Augmenix, Inc. (Augmenix), a privately-held company that developed and commercialized the SpaceOAR™ Hydrogel System to help reduce common and debilitating side effects that men may experience after receiving radiotherapy to treat prostate cancer. The transaction price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $500 million and up to $100 million in payments contingent upon achieving certain revenue-based milestones. Through December 31, 2020, we made incremental payments of $24 million to the prior shareholders of Augmenix in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the Augmenix business into our Urology and Pelvic Health division.

Claret Medical, Inc.

On August 2, 2018, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Claret Medical, Inc. (Claret), a privately-held company that has developed and commercialized the Sentinel™ Cerebral Embolic Protection System. The device is used to protect the brain during certain interventional procedures, predominately in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The transaction price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $220 million and an additional $50 million payment for achieving a reimbursement-based milestone that was achieved in the third quarter of 2018. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the Claret business into our Interventional Cardiology division.

Cryterion Medical, Inc.

On July 5, 2018, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Cryterion Medical, Inc. (Cryterion), a privately-held company developing a single-shot cryoablation platform for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. We had been an investor in Cryterion since 2016 and held an interest of approximately 35 percent immediately prior to the acquisition date. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake consisted of an upfront cash payment of $202 million. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the Cryterion business into our Electrophysiology division.

NxThera, Inc.

On April 30, 2018, we announced the closing of our acquisition of NxThera, Inc. (NxThera), a privately-held company that developed the Rezūm™ System, a minimally invasive therapy in a growing category of treatment options for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We held a minority interest immediately prior to the acquisition date. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake consisted of an upfront cash payment of approximately $240 million and up to approximately $85 million in future potential payments contingent upon achieving commercial milestones over the four years following the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, we have made incremental payments of $12 million to the prior shareholders of NxThera in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the NxThera business into our Urology and Pelvic Health division.
nVision Medical Corporation

On April 16, 2018, we announced the closing of our acquisition of nVision Medical Corporation (nVision), a privately-held company focused on women’s health. nVision developed the first and only device cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect cells from the fallopian tubes, offering a potential platform for earlier diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The transaction price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $150 million and up to an additional $125 million in future potential payments contingent upon achieving certain clinical and commercial milestones over the four years following the date of acquisition. Following the closing of the acquisition, we integrated the nVision business into our Urology and Pelvic Health division. We discontinued the nVision R&D program during 2020 and do not expect to make any incremental payments to the prior shareholders.

Other Acquisitions

In addition, we completed other individually immaterial acquisitions in 2018 for total consideration of $158 million in cash at closing plus aggregate future potential contingent consideration of up to $62 million.

We recorded gains of $184 million in 2018 within Other, net on our consolidated statements of operations based on the difference between the book values and the fair values of our previously-held investments immediately prior to the acquisition dates. The aggregate fair value of our previously-held investments immediately prior to the acquisition dates was $251 million. We remeasured the fair value of each previously-held investment based on the implied enterprise value and allocation of purchase price consideration according to priority of equity interests.

Purchase Price Allocation

We accounted for our 2018 acquisitions as business combinations, and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition dates. The final purchase prices were comprised of the following components:

(in millions)
----------------------------------------------- ----- -----
Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 1,449
Fair value of contingent consideration 248
Fair value of prior interests 251
 $ 1,948

The final combined purchase price allocation was comprised of the following components:

(in millions)
----------------------------------- ----- ---
Goodwill $ 939
Amortizable intangible assets 939
In-process research and development 213
Other assets acquired 38
Liabilities assumed (19)
Net deferred tax liabilities (162)
 $ 1,948

We allocated a portion of the combined purchase price to the specific intangible asset categories as follows:

Amount Assigned(in millions) Amortization Period(in years) Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates used in Purchase Price Allocation
----------------------------------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- --- -- -- -- - --- ---
Amortizable intangible assets
Technology-related $ 908 6 - 14 14 % - 23%
Other intangible assets 31 6 - 13 13 % - 15%
Indefinite-lived intangible assets
In-process research and development 213 n/a 15%
 $ 1,153

Our technology-related intangible assets consist of technical processes, intellectual property and institutional understanding with respect to products and processes that we intend to leverage in future products or processes and will carry forward from one product generation to the next. We used the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, to derive the fair value of the technology-related intangible assets and are amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.

Goodwill was primarily established due to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging our existing operations, as well as revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies. The goodwill recorded relating to our acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes.

Contingent Consideration

Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability were as follows:

(in millions)
----------------------------------------------------- ----- ---
Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 347
Amounts recorded related to current year acquisitions 127
Contingent consideration arrangements transferred (16)
Contingent consideration net expense (benefit) (35)
Contingent consideration payments (68)
Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 354
Contingent consideration net expense (benefit) (100)
Contingent consideration payments (58)
Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 196

As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to pay associated with our prior acquisitions was $532 million.

The $100 million benefit recorded in 2020 related to a reduction in the contingent consideration liability for certain prior acquisitions for which we reduced the probability of achievement of associated revenue and/or regulatory milestones upon which payment is conditioned, or in the case of nVision, for milestones that would not be achieved due to discontinuation of the R&D program.
The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent consideration liability that we expect to be required to settle include the following significant unobservable inputs:

Contingent Consideration Liability Fair Value as of December 31, 2020 Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range Weighted Average(1)
------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ----- ------------------- - --- ---
R&D, Regulatory and Commercialization-based Milestones $104 million Discounted Cash Flow Discount Rate 2% 2%
Probability of Payment 90% 90%
Projected Year of Payment 2027 2027
Revenue-based Payments $93 million Discounted Cash Flow Discount Rate 12 % - 14% 13%
Probability of Payment 80 % - 100% 100%
Projected Year of Payment 2021 - 2024 2022

(1)    Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liability. For projected year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average.

Projected contingent payment amounts related to our R&D, commercialization-based and revenue-based milestones are discounted back to the current period, primarily using a discounted cash flow model. Significant increases or decreases in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates or the time until payment is made would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as of December 31, 2020.

Strategic Investments

The aggregate carrying amount of our strategic investments was comprised of the following:

As of December 31,
-------------------------------------- ---- ---- --- ---
(in millions) 2020 2019

Measurement alternative investments(1) 183 171
Publicly-held securities(2) 414 1
Notes receivable 2 23
 $ 918 $ 458

(1)    Measurement alternative investments are privately-held equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, recognized in Other, net within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
(2)    Publicly-held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in Other, net within our consolidated statements of operations.

These investments are classified as Other long-term assets within our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies.In 2020, we recorded a $363 million gain on our investment in Pulmonx Corporation presented in Other, net to remeasure to fair value based on observable market prices. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of our aggregated equity method investments exceeded our share of the underlying equity in net assets by $272 million, which represents amortizable intangible assets, IPR&D, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities.

Intangible asset impairment charges were $460 million in 2020, $105 million in 2019 and $35 million in 2018. The impairment charges recorded in 2020 were primarily associated with our acquisitions of Apama Medical Inc. and nVision Medical Corporation (nVision) following management’s decision to cancel the programs due to cost to complete, time to market, overall economic viability or, specific to nVision, our understanding of the clinical evidence necessary to commercialize the technology. Intangible asset impairment charges in 2020 also included charges related to our acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. (Sadra Medical) as a result of lower sales forecasts, as well as the cost of quality remediation efforts following the voluntary recall of our LOTUS Edge™ Aortic Valve System and subsequent discontinuation of the LOTUS platform.

NOTE E – HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We address market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through risk management programs which include the use of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments. We operate these programs pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies and do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as the gains or losses on these derivatives generally offset losses or gains recognized on the hedged item.

We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties and by actively monitoring counterparty credit ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure. We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
Currency Hedging Instruments
Risk Management Strategy
Our risk from changes in currency exchange rates consists primarily of monetary assets and liabilities; forecasted intercompany and third-party transactions; net investments in certain subsidiaries; and, during 2019 prior to our acquisition of BTG, the purchase price of BTG, which was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. We manage currency exchange rate risk at a consolidated level to reduce the cost of hedging by taking advantage of offsetting transactions. We employ derivative and nonderivative instruments, primarily forward currency contracts, to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates.

The success of our currency risk management program depends, in part, on forecast transactions denominated primarily in Euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar and British pound sterling. We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent the actual activity is different than forecast, particularly resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on transaction volumes. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows.

Hedge Designations and Relationships

Certain of our currency derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (FASB ASC Topic 815), and are intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the Net change in derivative financial instruments component of Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (OCI) within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying third-party transaction occurs. When the underlying third-party transaction occurs, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings within Cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of operations. In the event the hedging relationship is no longer effective, or if the occurrence of the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable, we reclassify the gains or losses within AOCI to earnings at that time.

We also designate certain forward currency contracts as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in the Euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, South Korean won and Taiwan dollar. We elected to use the spot method to assess effectiveness for our derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges. Under the spot method, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in the Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) component of OCI. We have elected to exclude the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are amortizing this amount separately, as calculated at the date of designation, on a straight-line basis over the term of the currency forward contracts. Amortization of the spot-forward difference is then reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings as a component of Interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

In November 2019, we completed an offering of €900 million (approximately $1.000 billion) in aggregate principal amount of 0.625% senior notes due in 2027 (December 2027 Notes). The euro-denominated debt principal is a nonderivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our net investments in certain of our euro functional entities. We dedesignated a portion of the net investment hedge in 2020.

We also use forward currency contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships under FASB ASC Topic 815 as a part of our strategy to manage our exposure to currency exchange rate risk related to monetary assets and liabilities and related forecast transactions. These non-designated currency forward contracts have an original time to maturity consistent with the hedged currency transaction exposures, generally less than one year, and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings within Other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Certain of our non-designated forward currency contracts were entered into for the purpose of managing our exposure to currency exchange rate risk related to the British pound sterling-denominated purchase price of BTG. In 2019, we settled all outstanding contracts, for $294 million, which is presented within Payments for settlements of hedge contracts in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon settlement in 2019, we received £3.312 billion of cash to fund our acquisition of BTG, which translated into $4.303 billion based on hedged currency exchange rates. We recognized a $323 million loss in 2019 and a $29 million gain in 2018 in Other, net due to changes in fair value of the contracts.
Interest Rate Hedging Instruments
Risk Management Strategy

Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with exposure to changes in interest rates. Under these agreements, we and the counterparty, at specified intervals, exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.

Hedge Designations and Relationships

We had no interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Prior to 2020, we terminated interest rate derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges and are continuing to recognize the amortization of the gains or losses originally recorded within AOCI to earnings as a component of Interest expense over the same period that the hedged item affects earnings, provided the hedge relationship remains effective. If we determine the hedge relationship is no longer effective, or if the occurrence of the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable, we reclassify the amount of gains or losses from AOCI to earnings at that time.

In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives within OCI until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. The balance of the deferred amounts on our terminated cash flow hedges within AOCI was a $29 million loss as of December 31, 2020 and a $34 million loss as of December 31, 2019. We recognized immaterial gains and losses in Interest expense relating to the amortization of our terminated cash flow hedges in the current and prior periods.

We had no interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Prior to 2018, we terminated interest rate derivative instruments that were designated as fair value hedges and are continuing to recognize the amortization of the gains or losses originally recorded within Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets into earnings as a component of Interest expense over the same period that the discount or premium associated with the hedged items affects earnings. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as fair value hedges, we record the changes in the fair values of interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the underlying hedged debt instruments in Interest expense, which generally offset. The balance of the deferred gains on our terminated fair value hedges within Long-term debt was immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. We recognized immaterial gains in Interest expense relating to the amortization of the terminated fair value hedges in the current and prior periods.

The following table presents the contractual amounts of our hedging instruments outstanding:

(1)    The €900 million (approximately $1.000 billion) debt principal is a nonderivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our net investments in certain of our euro functional subsidiaries. We dedesignated a portion of the net investment hedges in 2020.

The remaining time to maturity as of December 31, 2020 is within 60 months for all forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges and generally less than one year for all non-designated forward currency contracts. The forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges generally mature within the next two years. The euro-denominated debt principal designated as a net investment hedge has a contractual maturity of December 1, 2027.

(2)    For our outstanding forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges, the net gain or loss reclassified from AOCI to earnings as a reduction of Interest expense represents the straight-line amortization of the excluded component as calculated at the date of designation. This initial value of the excluded component has been excluded from the assessment of effectiveness in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815. In the current period, we did not recognize any gains or losses on the components included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in earnings.
(3)    For our outstanding euro-denominated debt principal designated as a net investment hedge, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in the Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) component of OCI. No amounts were reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings.
As of December 31, 2020, pre-tax net gains or losses for our derivative instruments designated, or previously designated, as cash flow and net investment hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815 that may be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next twelve months are presented below (in millions):

Fair Value Measurements

FASB ASC Topic 815 requires all derivative and nonderivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments using the framework prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and our own creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, we may utilize financial models to measure fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments. In doing so, we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. The following are the balances of our derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities:

(in millions) Location on Consolidated Balance Sheets(1) As of December 31,

(1)We classify derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities as current when the settlement date of the contract is one year or less.
(2)The €900 million (approximately $1.000 billion) debt principal is a nonderivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our net investments in certain of our euro functional subsidiaries. We dedesignated a portion of the net investment hedges in 2020.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The category of a financial asset or a financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
•Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.
•Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based on management’s best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:

Our investments in money market funds and time deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. These investments are classified as Cash and cash equivalents within our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies. In addition to $1.584 billion invested in money market funds and time deposits as of December 31, 2020 and $50 million as of December 31, 2019, we held $150 million in interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts as of December 31, 2020 and $165 million as of December 31, 2019.

Our recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs related to our contingent consideration liability. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments for a discussion of the changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. In addition, our recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs related to our licensing arrangements, principally the contractual right to receive future royalty payments related to Zytiga™ Drug acquired with BTG. Prior to our acquisition of BTG, BTG agreed to pay 50 percent of the Zytiga royalty stream, net of certain offsets, to the inventors associated with the intellectual property. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold the remaining 50 percent we acquired through our acquisition with BTG of the future Zytiga royalty stream for an upfront cash payment of $256 million to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS). In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, we are accounting for the transfer of the royalty stream to OMERS as a secured borrowing, continue to recognize the financial asset and associated liability in our consolidated balance sheets and do not expect to receive any future cash benefit from Zytiga royalties.

We have elected the fair value option to account for our licensing arrangements' financial asset and financial liability in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded the fair values using a discounted cash flow approach considering the probability-weighted expected future cash flows to be generated by the royalty stream. The fair value of the financial liability also considers the related contractual provisions that govern our payment obligations.

The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our licensing arrangements recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 include the following significant unobservable inputs:

Licensing Arrangements Fair Value as of December 31, 2020 Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range Weighted Average(1)
------------------------- ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ----- ------------------- --- ---
Financial Asset $365 million Discounted Cash Flow Discount Rate 15% 15%
Projected Year of Payment 2021 - 2025 2023
Financial Liability $407 million Discounted Cash Flow Discount Rate 12% - 15% 13%
Projected Year of Payment 2021 - 2027 2024

(1)    Unobservable inputs relate to a single financial asset and liability. As such, unobservable inputs were not weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments. For projected year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average.
Significant increases or decreases in projected cash flows of the royalty stream and the related contractual provisions that govern our payment obligations, discount rates or the time until payment is made would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the licensing arrangements' financial asset and liability as of December 31, 2020. However, increases or decreases in the financial asset would be offset by increases or decreases in the financial liability, other than for timing of receipt and remittance; as such our earnings are not subject to material gains or losses from the licensing arrangement.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements

We hold certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition. The fair value of a measurement alternative investment is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments for a discussion of our strategic investments and Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for a discussion of the fair values of our intangible assets including goodwill.

The fair value of our outstanding debt obligations was $10.774 billion as of December 31, 2020, including $1.118 billion relating to the euro-denominated December 2027 Notes, and $11.020 billion as of December 31, 2019, including $1.004 billion relating to our euro-denominated December 2027 Notes. We determined fair value by using quoted market prices for our publicly registered senior notes, classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, and face value for commercial paper, term loans and credit facility borrowings outstanding. Refer to Note F – Contractual Obligations and Commitments for a discussion of our debt obligations.

Note: The table above does not include unamortized amounts related to interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
(1)    Coupon rates are semi-annual, except for the euro-denominated December 2027 Notes, which bear an annual coupon, and the August 2022 Term Loan, which was a variable-rate instrument based on LIBOR.
(2)    Corporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

Revolving Credit Facility

We maintain a $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks that matures on December 19, 2023 with one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including a financial covenant described within Financial Covenant below. In the first quarter of 2020, we refinanced $1.360 billion of commercial paper using proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2020, we entered into the April 2021 Term Loan, described below, and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. On May 28, 2020, we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement to permit payment of regularly scheduled quarterly cash dividends and other limited cash payments on our issued 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (MCPS) and other capital stock issued by us, which is or becomes mandatorily convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In May 2020, we completed our senior notes offering described below and used a portion of the proceeds to repay $450 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Term Loans

On April 21, 2020, in a proactive step to offset the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our short-term liquidity, we entered into a $1.250 billion term loan credit agreement scheduled to mature on April 20, 2021 (April 2021 Term Loan). We used proceeds from the April 2021 Term Loan to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the remaining amount under the December 2020 Term Loan described below. In May 2020, as described in further detail below, we used a portion of the proceeds from the May 2020 senior notes offering to prepay $500 million of amounts outstanding under the April 2021 Term Loan, and a portion of the combined net proceeds from our MCPS and common stock offerings to repay in full the remaining $750 million outstanding under the April 2021 Term Loan and to pay related fees, expenses and premiums, after which it was terminated.

On February 27, 2020, we entered into a $1.000 billion term loan credit agreement scheduled to mature on February 25, 2021 (February 2021 Term Loan). We used the proceeds from the February 2021 Term Loan to repay the remaining amounts outstanding on the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, described below. On May 28, 2020, we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement to permit payment of regularly scheduled quarterly cash dividends and other limited cash payments on our issued MCPS and other capital stock issued by us, which is or becomes mandatorily convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock. The February 2021 Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.85%. The credit agreement is subject to a financial covenant described below under Financial Covenant, and also contains customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of any outstanding commitments. We used a portion of the proceeds from our May 2020 senior notes offering, described below, to prepay $750 million of amounts outstanding under the February 2021 Term Loan in the second quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we prepaid the remaining $250 million and terminated the February 2021 Term Loan.

On December 5, 2019, we entered into a $700 million term loan credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on December 3, 2020 (December 2020 Term Loan). As of December 31, 2019, we had $700 million outstanding under the December 2020 Term Loan, and we used the proceeds to repay a portion of the Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, described below. In January 2020, we repaid $300 million of the outstanding balance of the December 2020 Term Loan with proceeds from our commercial paper program. In April 2020, we used the proceeds from the April 2021 Term Loan to repay the remaining amounts outstanding under the December 2020 Term Loan and terminated the December 2020 Term Loan.

On December 19, 2018, we entered into a $2.000 billion senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility consisting of a $1.000 billion two-year delayed draw term loan credit facility maturing in two years from the date of the closing of the acquisition of BTG (Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan) and a $1.000 billion three-year delayed draw term loan credit facility maturing in three years from the date of the closing of the acquisition of BTG (Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan). On August 19, 2019, for the purpose of funding the acquisition of BTG, we borrowed $1.000 billion under the Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and $1.000 billion under the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan. In 2019, we repaid all amounts outstanding on the Two-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan with proceeds from the sale of the Zytiga-related royalty interests, the December 2020 Term Loan and commercial paper and terminated the facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.000 billion outstanding under the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan (also referred to as the "August 2022 Term Loan" in the debt maturity schedule above). In the first quarter of 2020, we repaid all amounts outstanding on the Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loan with proceeds from the February 2021 Term Loan and terminated the facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under the Two and Three-Year Delayed Draw Term Loans and the facilities were terminated.

Financial Covenant

As of and through December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by our credit facilities described above.

 Covenant Requirementas of December 31, 2020 Actualas of December 31, 2020
----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
Maximum permitted leverage ratio(1) 4.75 times 3.48 times

(1) Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreements, as amended.

On April 21, 2020, we entered into an agreement with our banking syndicates to amend the financial covenant requirement for all of our outstanding credit arrangements as follows: (i) established a deemed Consolidated EBITDA of $671 million for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, reflecting average quarterly Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreements, for 2018 and 2019; and (ii) maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.75 times through the remainder of 2020, with a step-down for each succeeding fiscal quarter end to 4.50 times, 4.25 times, 4.00 times and ultimately 3.75 times for the fourth quarter of 2021 and through the remaining term of the facility. In addition, pursuant to the April 21, 2020
Revolving Credit Facility and February 2021 Term Loan amendments, the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" has been amended to exclude the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from what constitutes a material adverse effect through the remainder of 2020.

The financial covenant requirement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreements, through maturity, of any non-cash charges and up to $500 million in restructuring and restructuring-related net charges related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2020, we had $101 million of the restructuring net charges exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreements, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreements, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $2.624 billion in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2020, we had $926 million of the litigation exclusion remaining.

Any inability to maintain compliance with this amended covenant could require us to seek to further renegotiate the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility or seek waivers from compliance with this covenant, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us. In this case, all Revolving Credit Facility commitments would terminate, and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable. Furthermore, any termination of our Revolving Credit Facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable.

Commercial Paper

Our commercial paper program is backed by the Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed above. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. In the first quarter of 2020, we refinanced $1.360 billion of commercial paper using proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility and did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2020.

Senior Notes

We had senior notes outstanding of $9.205 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $7.661 billion as of December 31, 2019.

On December 29, 2020, we redeemed $250 million of our $500 million 3.375% senior notes due 2022 (May 2022 Notes) at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the terms of the May 2022 Notes and its indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the date of redemption.

In May 2020, we completed an offering of $1.700 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $500 million of 1.900% senior notes due June 2025 and $1.200 billion of 2.650% senior notes due June 2030. We used the net proceeds from the offering to refinance $450 million of amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, prepay $750 million of amounts outstanding under the $1.000 billion February 2021 Term Loan, prepay $500 million of amounts outstanding under the $1.250 billion April 2021 Term Loan and pay related fees, expenses and premiums.

In November 2019, we completed an offering of €900 million (approximately $1.000 billion) in aggregate principal amount of 0.625% senior notes due in 2027 (December 2027 Notes). The euro-denominated debt principal is a nonderivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our net investments in certain of our euro functional entities. Refer to Note E – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements for additional information. We used a portion of the net proceeds from our November 2019 senior notes offering to repay certain outstanding principal amounts of our senior notes including $206 million of our $450 million 4.125% senior notes due 2023, $566 million of our $1.000 billion 4.000% senior notes due 2028 and $227 million of our $750 million 3.850% senior notes due 2025 and pay accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses in
connection with the transaction. In 2019, we incurred associated debt extinguishment charges of $86 million presented in Interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

In February 2019, we completed an offering of $4.300 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $850 million of 3.450% senior notes due March 2024, $850 million of 3.750% senior notes due March 2026, $850 million of 4.000% senior notes due March 2029, $750 million of 4.550% senior notes due March 2039 and $1.000 billion of 4.700% senior notes due March 2049. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the $850 million plus accrued interest and premium of our 6.000% senior notes due in January 2020, the $600 million plus accrued interest and premium of our 2.850% senior notes due in May 2020 and the $1.000 billion plus accrued interest of our August 2019 Term Loan. In 2019, the remaining proceeds were used to finance a portion of our acquisition of BTG.

Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to liabilities of our subsidiaries (see Other Arrangements below).

Our $8.855 billion of senior notes issued in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2020 contain a change-in-control provision, which provides that each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of a change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings.

Other Arrangements

We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries and with commercial banks in China and Japan which include promissory notes discounting programs. We account for our factoring programs as sales under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. We have no retained interest in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administration, and once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Amounts de-recognized for accounts and notes receivable, which are excluded from Trade accounts receivable, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are aggregated by contract denominated currency below (in millions):

Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments

We had outstanding letters of credit of $124 million as of December 31, 2020 and $105 million as of December 31, 2019, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Future minimum purchase obligations, relating primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business, were as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):

Commercial Paper

Our commercial paper program is backed by the Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed above. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.

NOTE G – LEASES

We have operating and finance leases for real estate including corporate offices, land, warehouse space, and vehicles and certain equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are generally not recorded on the balance sheet, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option to renew the arrangement, that we are reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for short-term leases that we do not record on our balance sheet. If there is a change in our assessment of the lease term and, as a result, the remaining lease term extends more than 12 months from the end of the previously determined lease term, or we subsequently become reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, the lease no longer meets the definition of a short-term lease and is accounted for as either an operating or finance lease and recognized on the balance sheet. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, we account for the lease components and the non-lease components as a single lease component, with the exception of our warehouse leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to approximately 56 years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years. If we are reasonably certain we will exercise an option to extend the lease, the time period covered by the extension option is included in the lease term.

We determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present at the inception of the arrangement. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, we utilize the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received.

Our operating lease right-of-use assets are presented within Other long-term assets and corresponding liabilities are presented within Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note F – Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information.

NOTE H – RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ACTIVITIES

2019 Restructuring Plan

On November 15, 2018, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to a global restructuring program (the 2019 Restructuring Plan). The 2019 Restructuring Plan is intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers. Key activities under the 2019 Restructuring Plan include supply chain network optimization intended to maximize our global manufacturing and distribution network capacity and building functional capabilities that support business growth. These activities were initiated in 2019, with the majority of activity expected to be complete by the end of 2022, following a one-year extension approved by our Board of Directors on February 22, 2021.

On February 22, 2021, our Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion of the 2019 Restructuring Plan to include additional cost optimization activities, including the centralization of certain functional capabilities within the international regions in which we operate, and a one-year extension of the program to complete these activities along with certain other initiatives that were delayed in 2020 due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the majority of activity associated with our 2019 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, to be substantially complete by the end of 2022.
The following table provides a summary of our estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, by major type of cost, of which approximately $340 million to $440 million are expected to result in cash outlays:

Type of Cost (in millions) Total Estimated Amount Expected to be Incurred
------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- - ----
Restructuring charges:
Termination benefits $75 - $100
Other(1) 25 - 50
Restructuring-related expenses:
Other(2) 275 - 325
 $375 - $475

(1)    Consists primarily of consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.
(2)    Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs, and costs to transfer product lines among facilities.

2016 Restructuring Plan

On June 6, 2016, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to a restructuring initiative (the 2016 Restructuring Plan). The 2016 Restructuring Plan was intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on our Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and expand operational efficiencies in support of our operating income margin goals. Key activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan included strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate assets and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions and continuing implementation of

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements

We hold certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition. The fair value of a measurement alternative 

The fair value of our outstanding debt obligations was $10.774 billion as of December 31, 2020, including $1.118 billion relating to the euro-denominated December 2027 Notes, and $11.020 billion as of December 31, 2019, including $1.004 billion relating to our euro-denominated December 2027 Notes. We determined fair value by using quoted market prices for our publicly registered senior notes, classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, and face value for commercial paper, term loans and credit facility borrowings outstanding. Refer to Note F – Contractual Obligations and Commitments for a discussion of our debt obligations.

(1)    In all periods presented in the table above, the pre-tax (gain) loss amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings represent the effect of the hedging relationships on earnings. All other amounts included in earnings related to hedging relationships were immaterial.
(2)    For our outstanding forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges, the net gain or loss reclassified from AOCI to earnings as a reduction of Interest expense represents the straight-line amortization of the excluded component as calculated at the date of designation. This initial value of the excluded component has been excluded in earnings.
(3)    For our outstanding euro-denominated debt principal designated as a net investment hedge, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in the Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) component of OCI. No amounts were reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings.

 FASB ASC Topic 815 requires all derivative and nonderivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments using the framework prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and our own creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, we may utilize financial models to measure fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments. In doing so, we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.
 The following are the balances of our derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities:
