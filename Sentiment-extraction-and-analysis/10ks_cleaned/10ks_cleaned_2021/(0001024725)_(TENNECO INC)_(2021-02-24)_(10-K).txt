ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. All references to “Tenneco,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Tenneco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Notes referenced in this discussion and analysis refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements that are found in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.

OVERVIEW
Our Business
We design, manufacture, market, and distribute products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, motorsport, and aftermarket customers. We manufacture innovative clean air, powertrain and ride performance products and systems, and serve both original equipment (“OE”) manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets worldwide. We supply OE parts to vehicle manufacturers for use in light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and other mobility markets; and the global aftermarket with replacement parts that are sold to wholesalers, retailers, and installers, as well as original equipment service (“OES”) parts to OE customers to support their service channels. We serve our customers through leading brands, including Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, and others. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 201 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 73,000 people to service our customers’ demands.

Tenneco consists of four operating segments, Clean Air, Powertrain, Ride Performance, and Motorparts:
•The Clean Air segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to     reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning, and weight on a vehicle for light vehicle, commercial truck, and off-highway OE customers;
•The Powertrain segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of original equipment powertrain products for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, and industrial applications to OE customers for use in new vehicle production and OES parts to support their service and distribution channels;
•The Ride Performance segment designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of ride performance solutions and systems to a global OE customer base, including noise, vibration, and harshness performance materials, advanced suspension technologies, ride control, and braking; and
•The Motorparts segment designs, manufactures, sources, markets, and distributes a broad portfolio of leading brand-names products in the global vehicle aftermarket while also servicing the original equipment servicers market. Motorparts products are organized into categories, including shocks and struts, steering and suspension, braking, sealing, emissions control, engine, and maintenance.

Costs related to other business activities, primarily corporate headquarter functions, are disclosed separately from the four operating segments as “Corporate.” See Note 21, “Segment and Geographic Area Information”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets in the global financial markets. We have responded quickly to protect our team members’ health and safety while taking aggressive actions to mitigate the financial effect of the pandemic on us. In response to the pandemic, we expanded on structural cost reductions, and implemented a range of temporary cost reductions including plant closures, deferment of discretionary spending, and the reduction of capital expenditures. In addition, on April 15, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the availability of our tax assets in the current volatile market environment and, on May 5, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement to increase the maximum leverage ratio and decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio. There are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We believe we will comply with our financial covenants, as required by our amended credit agreement and we believe our liquidity position continues to be adequate based on our current estimates and forecasts.

Other factors that we expect will continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing and fulfillment footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes, positioning the business to adapt to changes in vehicle electrification, and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic and social factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards, and extended product life of automotive parts, also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as managing the availability of materials or increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the effect of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives, and other methods.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Motorparts segment initiated a rationalization of its supply chain and distribution network to achieve supply chain efficiencies and improve throughput to its customers. As a result, certain assets including inventory, real estate, and personal property would no longer be utilized. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Motorparts segment recognized an $82 million non-cash charge to write-down inventory to its net realizable value, a $16 million impairment charge to write-down property, plant, and equipment to its fair value, and a $9 million impairment charge to its operating lease right-of-use assets. Additionally, the Motorparts segment recognized $4 million in restructuring charges related to cash severance expected to be paid in connection with this action.

Strategic Alternatives
Following the closing of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company into an Aftermarket and Ride Performance company and a Powertrain Technology company. As such, we have previously announced that we are reviewing a full range of strategic options to enhance shareholder value creation. In light of current market conditions and other factors, our current efforts to optimize shareholder value creation are also focused on operational improvements, reducing structural costs, lowering capital intensity, reducing debt, and growth in targeted business lines.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Consolidated revenues were $15,379 million, a decrease of $2,071 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary driver of the decrease is from lower sales volume of $1,810 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in revenues of $106 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $89 million, and the net unfavorable effects of other of $66 million.

Cost of sales was $13,402 million, a decrease of $1,510 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary driver of the decrease is from lower sales volume of $1,212 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in cost of sales of $96 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the favorable effects of materials sourcing of $87 million, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $60 million, and the net favorable effects of other costs of $137 million. This was partially offset by a non-cash charge of $82 million related to the write-down of inventory in the Motorparts segment in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network. Included in other costs of $137 million, is $9 million of margin on discontinued product that was previously written-down.

Net loss increased by $1,240 million to $1,460 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by:
•an increase in restructuring charges, net and non-cash asset impairment charges of $496 million primarily related to the impairment of long-lived asset groups triggered by the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's projected financial information, global headcount and cost reduction initiatives, and other actions to optimize our distribution footprint and warehousing locations;
•a net increase in non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $142 million, which was comprised of an increase of $159 million in goodwill impairment charges, an increase of $65 million in definite-lived intangible asset impairments, and a decrease of $82 million in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments; and
•an increase in income tax expense of $440 million primarily attributable to the $507 million in non-cash charges to tax expense relating to the full valuation allowances established for the U.S. deferred taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $98 million in non-cash charges to tax expense for changes in valuation allowance for deferred taxes relating to non-U.S. jurisdictions. This is partially offset by the federal and state tax benefits and foreign rate differential on the change of the loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Table of Contents

These unfavorable effects were partially offset by:
•a decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs of $249 million, primarily due to $88 million in lower acquisition and expected separation costs, and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19, including unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, temporary support programs, and other compensation related expenses;
•a decrease in engineering, research, and development of $51 million primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 and cost reduction initiatives; and
•a decrease in interest expense of $45 million primarily attributable to lower interest rates on variable rate debt, which was partially offset by higher interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings on the revolver. This also includes a decrease of $11 million in financing charges on sales of accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Recent Trends and Market Conditions
There is inherent uncertainty in the continuation of the trends discussed below. In addition, there may be other factors or trends that can have an effect on our business. Our business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:

General economic conditions
Our OE business is directly related to automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive production levels depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions, and policies. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by four primary factors: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; vehicle usage trends (primarily miles driven); and component failure and wear rates.

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 has resulted in suspension or reduction of operations, supply chain disruptions, restrictions on domestic and international travel, and a decrease in consumer traffic. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, reductions in revenue, and delays in payments from customers and partners, have led to an economic downturn in many of our markets.

The decline in value-add revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,399 million which is largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic will likely continue during 2021, the extent of which will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity. Therefore, there are many uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. As customer demand increases, we expect to face periods where payments will become due to suppliers for our existing and additional inventories to support renewed production before we have generated new receivables from customers from that renewed production. It is our intent to maintain a consistent balance between our payables and receivables during this time.

Cost reductions and other responses to COVID-19
We have implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity in response to the effects and anticipated effects to our business resulting from COVID-19 as described under “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Financing Arrangements”. The Company will continue to evaluate further ways to manage costs in line with reduced revenue.

Global vehicle production levels
Light vehicle production (According to IHS Markit, February 2021)
For the year ended December 31, 2020, global light vehicle production was down across all major markets in which we operate and down 16% overall compared to 2019. Light vehicle production was down 20% in North America, 22% in Europe, 32% in South America, 4% in China and 23% in India.

Global light vehicle production in 2021 is expected to improve across all major markets in which we operate and an improvement of 13% overall compared to 2020. Current projections show a 24% improvement in North America, 14% improvement in Europe, 33% improvement in South America, 6% improvement in China, and 23% improvement in India.

Commercial truck production (According to IHS Markit, February 2021)
Global commercial truck production decreased by 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. North America commercial truck production declined 31%, Brazil was down 24%, Europe declined 18%, and India fell 59%. Commercial truck production in China grew 27% in 2020 when compared to 2019.

Global commercial truck production is expected to improve in most major markets in which we operate during 2021, however production overall is projected to be down 8% compared to 2020 as the expected decline in China production more than offsets the projected improvements in other regions. Current 2021 projections show North America up 28%, Brazil up 20%, Europe up 11%, India up 63%, and China down 30% over 2020.

Fuel efficiency, powertrain evolution, and vehicle electrification
Various jurisdictions around the world have announced plans to limit the production of new diesel and gasoline powered vehicles in the future. Major vehicle manufacturers have announced their intention to reduce and phase out production of diesel and gasoline powered vehicles during the next two decades. However, for the foreseeable future, it is expected that the majority of the powertrains for light and commercial vehicles will be gasoline and diesel engines (including hybrids, which combine a battery electric drive with a combustion engine). While we see similar electrification trends for light vehicle and commercial vehicle, we expect light vehicles will experience those trends in advance of commercial vehicles. We expect to monitor those trends and adopt our business strategy accordingly.

Revenues
Revenues decreased by $2,071 million, or 12%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the decrease is lower sales volume and unfavorable mix of $1,810 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in revenues of $106 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $89 million, and the net unfavorable effects of other of $66 million.

The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in revenues (amounts in millions):

------------------------------------------ ------- ------
Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 17,450
Acquisitions and divestitures, net (106)
Drivers in the change of organic revenues:
Volume and mix (1,810)
Currency exchange rates (89)

Year Ended December 31, 2020 $ 15,379

Cost of sales
Cost of sales decreased by $1,510 million, or 10%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the decrease is from lower sales volume of $1,212 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in cost of sales of $96 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the favorable effects of materials sourcing of $87 million, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $60 million, and the net favorable effects of other costs of $137 million. This was partially offset by a non-cash charge of $82 million related to the write-down of inventory in the Motorparts segment in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network. Included in other costs of $137 million, is $9 million of margin on discontinued product that was previously written-down.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A decreased by $249 million to $889 million compared to $1,138 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to $88 million in lower acquisition and expected separation costs, and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19, including unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, temporary support programs, and other compensation related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, SG&A includes a reduction of $9 million recognized for a non-income tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $34 million to $639 million compared to $673 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to the effects of the impairments on property, plant, and equipment recognized in the first quarter of 2020.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development decreased by $51 million to $273 million as compared to $324 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the effects of COVID-19 and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives.

Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments
Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments increased by $496 million to $622 million as compared to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to non-cash property, plant, and equipment asset impairments in the Ride Performance segment of $455 million; non-cash asset impairment charges in the Motorparts segment of $25 million related to its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network; and a non-cash asset impairment charge of $17 million for operating lease right-of-use assets in the corporate component during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, there was an increase of $6 million for cash severance costs expected to be paid as part of global headcount and cost reduction actions across all segments and regions, including plant closures, which was more than offset by a decrease of $6 million in impairments related to assets held for sale and a decrease in other asset impairments of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Goodwill and intangible impairment charges
Goodwill and intangible impairment charges increased by $142 million to $383 million as compared to $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to $267 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges, $65 million of non-cash definite-lived intangible asset impairments, and $51 million of non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was the result of the effects of COVID-19 on the projected financial information during the first quarter of 2020. This compared to $108 million of goodwill impairment charges recognized for three of our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2019. These non-cash goodwill impairment charges included $69 million in the Ride Performance segment as a result of our reporting unit reorganization and a $21 million impairment charge in the Motorparts segment, and an $18 million impairment charge in the Powertrain segment as a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, as a result of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $133 million were recorded for two reporting units in the Motorparts segment.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs) credits
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs) credits increased by $29 million to a net credit of $18 million as compared to a net cost of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to the elimination of certain health care benefits in retirement for participants in one of our union agreements that resulted in a non-cash curtailment gain of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a curtailment gain of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from the plan amendments approved during 2019 to eliminate postretirement benefits for certain nonunion employees. The remaining change was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by a higher amortization and a lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower long-term rate of return.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax
Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased by $4 million to $47 million as compared to $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019, a non-cash reduction of $12 million was recognized as a result of finalizing purchase accounting for the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, and completing the purchase price allocation for certain equity method investments, which represents amounts to recognize the basis difference between the fair value and book value of certain assets, including inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. After the purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year, equity earnings (losses) decreased year over year primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 on the equity in earnings (losses) of our nonconsolidated affiliates located in Turkey, China, Korea, and the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
A non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $2 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of the 4.875% euro denominated senior secured notes during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net decreased by $15 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a recovery of value-added tax in a foreign jurisdiction for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Interest expense
Interest expense decreased by $45 million to $277 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $322 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $45 million decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt, partially offset by higher interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings on the revolver during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense also included losses on sales of accounts receivables, which was $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Income tax expense (benefit)
Income tax expense increased by $440 million to $459 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $19 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily the result of the $507 million in non-cash charges to tax expense relating to the full valuation allowances established for the U.S. deferred taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $98 million in non-cash charges to tax expense for changes in valuation allowance for deferred taxes relating to non-U.S. jurisdictions. This is partially offset by the federal and state tax benefits and foreign rate differential on the change of the loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net income (loss)
Net loss increased by $1,240 million to $1,460 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the aforementioned items.

Segment Results of Operations

Overview of Net Sales and Operating Revenues
Our Clean Air segment has substrate sales. Substrates are porous ceramic filters coated with a catalyst - typically, precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. We do not manufacture substrates, they are supplied to us by Tier 2 suppliers generally directed by our OE customers. We generally earn a small margin on these components of the system. These substrate components have been increasing as a percentage of our revenue as the need for more sophisticated emission control solutions increases to meet more stringent environmental regulations, and as we capture more diesel aftertreatment business. While these substrates dilute our gross margin percentage, they are a necessary component of an emission control system.

Our value-add content in an emission control system includes designing the system to meet environmental regulations through integration of the substrates into the system, maximizing use of thermal energy to heat up the catalyst quickly, efficiently managing airflow to reduce back pressure as the exhaust stream moves past the catalyst, managing the expansion and contraction of the emission control system components due to temperature extremes experienced by an emission control system, using advanced acoustic engineering tools to design the desired exhaust sound, minimizing the opportunity for the fragile components of the substrate to be damaged when we integrate it into the emission control system and reducing unwanted noise, vibration, and harshness transmitted through the emission control system.

We disclose substrate sales amounts because we believe investors utilize this information to understand the effect of this portion of our revenues on our overall business and because it removes the effect of potentially volatile precious metals pricing from our revenues. While our OE customers generally assume the risk of precious metals pricing volatility, it affects our reported revenues.

The table below reflects the main drivers for changes in our segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in millions):

Segment Revenue
Clean Air
Clean Air revenue decreased $400 million, or 6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in value-add revenue of $728 million, partially offset by the increase in substrate sales of $328 million. Overall for the Clean Air segment, lower light vehicle and off-highway and other revenues were the main drivers of the value-add revenue decline while commercial truck improved when compared to the prior year. In addition, foreign currency exchange had a $4 million unfavorable effect on Clean Air value-add revenue while other unfavorable effects decreased value-add revenue by $62 million.

Powertrain
Powertrain revenue decreased $682 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower light vehicle, commercial truck, industrial, and off-highway and other vehicle revenue contributed $624 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $7 million. Foreign currency exchange had a $15 million unfavorable effect on Powertrain revenue, while other unfavorable effects decreased revenue by $36 million.

Ride Performance
Ride Performance revenue decreased $547 million, or 20%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, and other vehicle revenues contributed $505 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $23 million. Foreign currency exchange had a $6 million unfavorable effect on Ride Performance revenue, while other unfavorable effects decreased revenue by $13 million.

Motorparts
Motorparts revenue decreased $442 million, or 14%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower sales across all regions in which we operate contributed $356 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $76 million, and foreign currency exchange had a $55 million unfavorable effect on Motorparts revenues. The unfavorable effects were partially offset by other net favorable effects of $45 million.

EBITDA including noncontrolling interests
The following table presents the EBITDA including noncontrolling interests by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in millions):

----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----- ------------------- - --- - -----
 Year Ended December 31 2020 vs 2019 Change
 2020 2019
EBITDA including noncontrolling interests by Segment:
Clean Air $ 440 $ 582 $ (142)
Powertrain $ 130 $ 363 $ (233)
Ride Performance $ (595) $ 8 $ (603)
Motorparts $ 155 $ 184 $ (29)

Clean Air
Clean Air EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $142 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable operating performance and lower SG&A costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Powertrain
Powertrain EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $233 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, an increase in cash severance charges expected to be paid of $19 million, and an increase in goodwill impairment charge of $142 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable operating performance and lower SG&A and engineering, research, and development costs. Included in the lower SG&A costs is a reduction of $9 million for a non-income tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Ride Performance
Ride Performance EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $603 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $455 million and goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $113 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. Also contributing to the decrease is lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower SG&A and engineering, research, and development costs.

Motorparts
Motorparts EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $29 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and unfavorable mix, an increase in goodwill impairment charge of $49 million and a non-cash charge to cost of sales of $82 million related to the write-down of inventory recognized in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable operating performance, lower SG&A costs and a decrease in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $93 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity and Financing Arrangements
The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets in the global financial markets. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic will likely continue during 2021, the extent of which will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity. We believe our liquidity position continues to be adequate. However, with the recent economic downturn related to COVID-19, we expect to see lower revenue and lower earnings as part of the global recovery. As customer demand increases, we expect to face periods where payments will become due to our suppliers for our existing and additional inventories needed to support renewed production before we have generated new receivables from customers from that renewed production. It is our intent to maintain a consistent balance between our payables and receivables during this time.

We have implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity in response to the effects and anticipated effects to our business resulting from COVID-19. These measures include:
•Temporarily suspending or reducing operations;
•As discussed in more detail in Note 11, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” and below, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio and decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio;
•At December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of $803 million of cash and $1.5 billion undrawn on our revolving credit facility;
•During 2020, overall salary costs were reduced at least 25% during the second quarter and 10% during the third quarter through a combination of unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, and available temporary support programs in all regions Tenneco does business. Additionally, the executive leadership team (the CEO and direct staff) had reduced their salaries by 50% in the second quarter and 20% in the third quarter. Employee salaries were restored to their prior levels effective October 1, 2020;
•We reduced our headcount globally, and plan further reductions subject to negotiation with works councils in certain jurisdictions, beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and expect these actions to be completed during 2021;
•Capital expenditures in 2020 amounted to $394 million. This is a reduction from 2019 expenditures of $744 million;
•Utilizing applicable and appropriate provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) including deferral of our portion of the 2020 FICA payroll taxes which will be repaid in 2021 and 2022, and payroll tax credits; and
•The Tenneco Board of Directors annual retainer fees were reduced by 25% effective for the third and fourth quarters of 2020.

On May 5, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement to increase the maximum leverage ratio and decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, we are in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement. There are many uncertainties related to COVID-19 that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We believe we will comply with these financial covenants, as required by our amended credit agreement. The amendment is discussed in more detail below.

We believe cash flows from operations, combined with our cash on hand and committed and undrawn capacity under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements, including debt amortization, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other operational requirements, for the following year based on our current estimates and forecasts. We believe we will maintain compliance with the new financial ratios set forth in the amended credit agreement. However, our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors, including the effects of COVID-19, many of which are beyond our control. In the event we are unable to meet these financial covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. Such actions include additional restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions, sales of assets, reductions to working capital and capital spending, issuance of equity, and other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position. We also continue to actively monitor credit market conditions for the right opportunity to replace and extend maturity.

Credit Facilities
The table below shows our borrowing capacity on committed credit facilities at December 31, 2020 (amounts in billions):

------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------ ------------ ---
 Committed Credit Facilities at December 31, 2020
 Term Available(b)
Tenneco Inc. revolving credit facility (a) 2023 $ 1.5
Tenneco Inc. Term Loan A 2023 —
Tenneco Inc. Term Loan B 2025 —
Subsidiaries’ credit agreements 2021-2028 —
 $ 1.5

(a)We are required to pay commitment fees under the revolving credit facility on the unused portion of the total commitment.
(b)Letters of credit reduce the available borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had $28 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduces our senior credit facility borrowing availability. In addition, the Company had $75 million of outstanding letters of credit under uncommitted facilities at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of $803 million of cash and $1.5 billion undrawn on our revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2020.

Term Loans
We entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and other lenders (the “New Credit Facility”) in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, which has been amended by the first amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “First Amendment”), by the second amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”), and by the third amendment, dated May 5, 2020 (the "Third Amendment"). The New Credit Facility consists of $4.9 billion of total debt financing, consisting of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility (“Term Loan A”) and a seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility (“Term Loan B”). We paid $8 million in one-time fees in connection with the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, and $10 million in one-time fees in connection with the Third Amendment.

New Credit Facility — Interest Rates and Fees
At December 31, 2020, prior to giving effect to the Third Amendment, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility was LIBOR plus 2.50% and will remain at LIBOR plus 2.50% for each relevant period for which the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) is equal to or greater than 6.0 to 1. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility are subject to step down as follows:

-------------------------------------------- ----------------
Consolidated net leverage ratio Interest rate
greater than 3.0 to 1 LIBOR plus 2.00%
less than 3.0 to 1 and greater than 2.5 to 1 LIBOR plus 1.75%
less than 2.5 to 1 and greater than 1.5 to 1 LIBOR plus 1.50%
less than 1.5 to 1 LIBOR plus 1.25%

The Third Amendment provides for an increase to the margin applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility at certain leverage levels as set forth below as one of several conditions for obtaining less restrictive financial maintenance covenants described below under New Credit Facility — Other Terms and Conditions:

-------------------------------------------- ----------------
Consolidated net leverage ratio Interest rate
greater than 6.0 to 1 LIBOR plus 2.50%
less than 6.0 to 1 and greater than 4.5 to 1 LIBOR plus 2.25%

Initially, and so long as the Company's corporate family rating is Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or higher from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BB- (with a stable outlook) or higher from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), the interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 2.75%; at any time the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the interest rate on the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 3.00%. When the Term Loan B facility is no longer outstanding and the Company and its subsidiaries have no other secured indebtedness (with certain exceptions set forth in the New Credit Facility), and upon the Company achieving and maintaining two or more corporate credit and/or corporate family ratings higher than or equal to BBB- from S&P, BBB- from Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and/or Baa3 from Moody’s (in each case, with a stable or positive outlook), the collateral under the New Credit Facility may be released. On June 3, 2019, Moody’s lowered our corporate family rating to B1 and the interest rate on borrowings under the term loan B was raised to LIBOR plus 3.00%.

New Credit Facility — Other Terms and Conditions
The New Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, and covenants which are customary for debt facilities of this type. The Third Amendment provided relief from the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and Term Loan A facility subject to the non-occurrence of certain covenant reset triggers (“Covenant Reset Triggers”) that limit certain of our activities by implementing more restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, as more fully described below. After giving effect to the Third Amendment, the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility include (i) a requirement to have a senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility), with step-downs, as detailed in the table below; (ii) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility), with step-downs, as follows:

------------------------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------------------- ---------------------
(i) Senior secured net leverage ratio (ii) Consolidated net leverage ratio
not greater than 6.75 to 1 at June 30, 2020 not greater than 4.50 to 1 at March 31, 2020
not greater than 9.50 to 1 at September 30, 2020 not greater than 5.25 to 1 at March 31, 2022
not greater than 8.75 to 1 at December 31, 2020 not greater than 4.75 to 1 at June 30, 2022
not greater than 8.25 to 1 at March 31, 2021 not greater than 4.25 to 1 at September 30, 2022
not greater than 4.50 to 1 at June 30, 2021 not greater than 3.75 to 1 thereafter
not greater than 4.25 to 1 at September 30, 2021
not greater than 4.00 to 1 at December 31, 2021
and (iii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1 as of March 31, 2020, 2.00 to 1 as of June 30, 2020, 1.50 to 1 through March 31, 2021, and 2.75 to 1 thereafter.

If a Covenant Reset Trigger occurs, the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility revert back to the previous financial maintenance covenants in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment (the “Prior Financial Covenants”), including (i) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility), at the end of each fiscal quarter, with step-downs, as follows:

----------------------------------- --------------------------
(i) Consolidated net leverage ratio
not greater than 4.50 to 1 through March 31, 2021
not greater than 4.25 to 1 through September 30, 2021
not greater than 4.00 to 1 through March 31, 2022
not greater than 3.75 to 1 through September 30, 2022
not greater than 3.50 to 1 thereafter

and (ii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1.

In addition, we may make a one-time election to revert back to the Prior Financial Covenants and terminate the applicability of the Covenant Reset Triggers upon delivery of a covenant reset certificate to the administrative agent under the New Credit Facility that attests to compliance with the Prior Financial Covenants as of the end of the relevant fiscal period (“Covenant Reset Certificate”). Refer to Note 11, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details.

The Covenant Reset Triggers include certain limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (a) incur additional indebtedness, (b) enter into additional sales and leasebacks, (c) create additional liens over their assets, (d) pay dividends or distributions to Tenneco’s stockholders, (e) prepay certain unsecured indebtedness of us or our restricted subsidiaries (as more fully described below), (f) make additional investments, (g) dispose of material intellectual property, and (h) reinvest the proceeds of certain asset sales in the business in lieu of repaying indebtedness, each as more specifically described in the Third Amendment. These limitations are in addition to other affirmative and negative covenants (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers and limitations) in the New Credit Facility, including with respect to: financial reporting; payment of taxes; maintenance of existence; compliance with law and material contractual obligations; maintenance of property and insurance; inspection of property, books and records; notices of certain events; compliance with environmental laws; provision and maintenance of collateral perfection; satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants described above; incurrence of indebtedness; permitting liens over assets; mergers, consolidations, dispositions or other fundamental transactions; dispositions and asset sales; restricted payments; investments; compliance with limitations on certain transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates; sale and leaseback transactions; changes in fiscal periods; negative pledge clauses in certain contracts; changes to lines of business; prepayments and modifications of certain subordinated indebtedness (as more fully described below); use of proceeds; transactions involving special purpose finance subsidiaries; and transactions related to effectuating a spin-off (as defined in the New Credit Facility), each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

The Covenant Reset Triggers in the Third Amendment generally prohibit us from repaying the Senior Unsecured Notes. After giving effect to the Third Amendment, so long as no default exists under its New Credit Facility, we would be permitted to (i) make regularly scheduled interest and principal payments as and when due in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes, (ii) refinance the Senior Unsecured Notes with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (iii) make payments in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after May 5, 2020; (iv) convert any Senior Unsecured Notes into qualified capital stock issued after May 5, 2020; and (v) make additional payments of the Senior Unsecured Notes provided that after giving effect to such additional payments the consolidated leverage ratio would be equal to or less than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments. The foregoing limitations regarding repayment and refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Notes apply from the effectiveness of the Third Amendment until delivery of a Covenant Reset Certificate.

The covenants in the New Credit Facility generally prohibit us from repaying certain subordinated indebtedness. So long as no default exists, we would, under our New Credit Facility, be permitted to repay or refinance our subordinated indebtedness (i) with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (ii) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after October 1, 2018; (iii) in exchange for qualified capital stock issued after October 1, 2018; and (iv) with additional payments provided that such additional payments are capped based on a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio after giving effect to such additional payments.

Such additional payments on subordinated indebtedness (x) will not be permitted at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments and (y) will be permitted in an unlimited amount at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments.

The New Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, including, as a condition to future revolver borrowings, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of borrowing, including representations (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers and limitations) as to: existence; compliance with law; power, authority and enforceability; no violation of law or material contracts; material litigation; no default under the New Credit Facility and related documents; ownership of property, including material intellectual property; payment of material taxes; compliance with margin stock regulations; labor matters; ERISA; Investment Company Act matters; subsidiaries; use of loan proceeds; environmental matters; accuracy of information; security documents; solvency; anti-corruption laws and sanctions; and that since December 31, 2017 there has been no development or event that has had a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

Table of Contents

The New Credit Facility includes customary events of default and other provisions that could require all amounts due thereunder to become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the option of the lenders, if we fail to comply with the terms of the New Credit Facility or if other customary events occur. These events of default (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers, limitations and grace periods) include: (i) failure to pay obligations under the New Credit Facility when due; (ii) material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; (iii) failure to comply with the covenants in the New Credit Facility and related documents (as summarized above); (iv) cross-default to material indebtedness; (v) commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (vi) ERISA events; (vii) certain material judgments; (viii) invalidity or unenforceability of security and guarantee documents; and (ix) change of control, each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: senior secured net leverage ratio of 3.02 actual versus 8.75 (maximum required under the Third Amendment); and interest coverage ratio of 5.04 actual versus 2.75 (minimum required under the Third Amendment). The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.46 actual versus 4.00 (maximum without giving effect to the First Amendment, the Second Amendment or the Third Amendment); and interest coverage ratio of 5.38 actual versus 2.75 (minimum without giving effect to the First Amendment, the Second Amendment or the Third Amendment).

On November 30, 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior secured notes due January 15, 2029 (the “7.875% Senior Secured Notes”). We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 7.875% Senior Secured Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 4.875% euro denominated senior secured notes on December 14, 2020. The 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the 7.875% Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Senior Secured Notes”) were outstanding at December 31, 2020.

Under the indentures covering the Senior Unsecured Notes, we are permitted to redeem some or all of the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, at specified redemption prices that decline to par over a specified period, at any time (a) on or after December 15, 2019, in the case of the 2024 Senior Notes and (b) on or after July 15, 2021, in the case of the 2026 Senior Notes. In addition, the Senior Unsecured Notes may also be redeemed at any time at a redemption price generally equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole premium" as set forth in the indentures. We did not redeem any of the Senior Unsecured Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020. We are permitted to redeem some or all of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes at specified redemption prices that decline to par over a specified period, at any time (a) on or after July 15, 2020, in the case of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, (b) on or after April 15, 2018, in the case of the Euro Floating Rate Notes and (c) on or after January 15, 2024, in the case of the 7.875% Senior Secured Notes. Prior to July 15, 2020, we may also redeem the 5.00% Euro Fixed Rate Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole premium" as set forth in the indenture. Prior to January 15, 2024, we may also redeem the 7.875% Senior Secured Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole premium” as set forth in the indenture. Further, we may also redeem up to 40% of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time prior to July 15, 2020 at a redemption price of 105.0% of the principal amount thereto, and we may redeem up to 40% of the 7.875% Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time prior to January 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 107.875% of the principal amount thereto.

If we experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase each of the Senior Unsecured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if we sell certain of our assets and do not apply the proceeds from the sale in a certain manner within 365 days of the sale, we must use such unapplied proceeds to make an offer to repurchase each of the 2024 Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes — Other Terms and Conditions
The Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Senior Notes also require that, as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro forma basis, be greater than 2.00, as well as containing restrictions on our operations, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional indebtedness; (ii) paying dividends; (iii) distributions and stock repurchases; (iv) investments; (v) asset sales; (vi) entering into transactions with our affiliates; and (vii) mergers and consolidations.

Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material, domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes to make distributions to us.

Factoring Arrangements
We have securitization programs for some of our accounts receivable, with limited recourse provisions. Borrowings on these securitization programs, which are recorded in short-term debt, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (amounts in millions):

------------------------------------- ----------- - ---- - -

We have accounts receivable factoring programs in the U.S. with commercial banks. Under these programs we sell receivables from certain of our U.S. OE customers at a rate that is favorable versus our senior credit facility. These arrangements are uncommitted and provide for cancellation with no less than 30 days prior written notice. In addition, we have other receivable factoring programs in the U.S. with commercial banks under which we sell receivables from certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payments. These arrangements are uncommitted and may be terminated with 10 days to 30 days prior notice.

We also have subsidiaries in several countries in Europe that are parties to accounts receivable factoring facilities. The commitments for these arrangements are generally for one year, but some may be canceled with notice 90 days prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification.

Certain of these programs have deferred purchase price arrangements with the banks. These programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing.

In the U.S and Canada, we participate in supply chain financing programs with certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payment terms whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the early receipt of negotiable financial instruments that are payable at a later date when payments from our customers are due. We sell these financial instruments before their maturity date to various financial institutions at a discount.

The accounts receivables under the programs described above are transferred in their entirety to the acquiring entities and are accounted for as a sale. The fair value of assets received as proceeds in exchange for the transfer of accounts receivable under these factoring programs approximates the fair value of such receivables. We are the servicer of the receivables under some of these arrangements and are responsible for performing all accounts receivable administration functions. Where we receive a fee to service and monitor these transferred accounts receivables, such fees are sufficient to offset the costs and as such, a servicing asset or liability is not recorded as a result of such activities.

The amount of accounts receivable outstanding and derecognized for these factoring and drafting arrangements was $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 relate to accounts receivable where we have continuing involvement. In addition, the deferred purchase price receivable was $51 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Proceeds from the factoring of accounts receivable qualifying as sales and drafting programs was $4.1 billion and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion were received on accounts receivable where we have continuing involvement for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

(a) Amount is included in "Interest expense" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

If we were not able to factor receivables or sell drafts under these programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase. These programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Supply Chain Financing
Certain of our suppliers participate in supply chain financing programs under which they securitize their accounts receivables from us. Financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing program on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables or drafts from our suppliers at any time. We began to wind down these programs in 2019 and ended them in the third quarter of 2020.

Total change in operating assets and liabilities 384 (88)
Net cash (used) provided by operating activities $ 629 $ 444

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $629 million, an increase of $185 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The activity was the result of:
•a net increase of $472 million in net cash provided by operating activities due to favorable changes in working capital items; and
•a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital of $287 million.

The favorable working capital changes can be attributed primarily to inventory efficiency gains reflecting higher inventory turns and lower days of inventory on hand. Net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited by renegotiated payment terms with our suppliers and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Our cash flows had a one-time benefit from these items in 2020. We anticipate the 2021 effect of these items to be partially offset by other improvements to cash flow during 2021.

If we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our New Credit Facility or senior notes indentures described above, all amounts under those arrangements could, automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders, become due. Additionally, each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility, allowing the acceleration of all amounts due. We currently expect to maintain compliance with the terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future.

Included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long-term debt. As our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate obligations, we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of future interest payments. Interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 5.375% and 5.000%, and interest on our fixed rate Senior Secured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 5.000% and 7.875%. Interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as LIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2020 for our term loans, and Euribor plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2020 for our floating rate euro notes. We have assumed that both LIBOR and the Euribor rates will remain unchanged for the outlying years.

We have also included an estimate of expenditures required after December 31, 2020 to complete the projects authorized at December 31, 2020, in which we have made substantial commitments in connection with purchasing property, plant and equipment for our operations. For 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $450 million and $500 million.

We have included an estimate of the expenditures necessary after December 31, 2020 to satisfy purchase requirements pursuant to certain ordinary course supply agreements that we have entered into. With respect to our other supply agreements, they generally do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase. In many cases, if any commitment is provided, the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier. As a result, these purchase obligations fluctuate from year-to-year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligations.

We have not included material cash requirements for unrecognized tax benefits or taxes. It is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant effect on our future tax payments. We have also not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement benefit costs. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to make contributions of approximately $95 million to those plans in 2021. Pension and postretirement contributions beyond 2021 will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of its pension fund investments during 2021 and future discount rate changes. For additional information relating to the funding of our pension and other postretirement plans, refer to Note 13, “Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information. In addition, we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to spend approximately $31 million over the next 30 years. However, due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors, it is difficult to determine the actual timing of the payments. Refer to Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

We occasionally provide guarantees that could require it to make future payments in the event that the third-party primary obligor does not make its required payments. The Company is not required to record a liability for any of these guarantees.

Additionally, we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. All of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our New Credit Facility and our senior notes on a joint and several basis. The New Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As described above, certain of our senior notes are secured by pledges of stock and assets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. The following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. We perform assessments at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Our assessment of fair value utilizes a combination of the income approach, market approach, and, in instances where a reporting unit's free cash flows do not support the value of the underlying assets, an asset approach. In our assessment, for reporting units where the free cash flows support the value of the underlying assets, we apply a 75% weighting to the income approach and a 25% weighting to the market approach. The most significant inputs in estimating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach are (i) projected operating margins, (ii) the revenue growth rate, and (iii) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on the aforementioned inputs.

Similar to goodwill, we evaluate our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated the assets might be impaired. We perform a quantitative assessment of estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. The primary, and most sensitive, inputs utilized in determining fair values of our trade names and trademarks are (i) our projected branded product sales, (ii) the revenue growth rate, (iii) the royalty rate, and (iv) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on our projected branded sales.

The basis of the goodwill impairment and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses is our annual budget and three-year strategic plan. This includes a projection of future cash flows based on new products, awarded business, customer commitments, and independent market data, which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and revenue growth rates. The key factors that affect our estimates are (i) future production estimates; (ii) customer preferences and decisions; (iii) product pricing; (iv) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (v) product life / business retention. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

While we believe the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable, due to the many variables inherent in estimating fair value and the relative size of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis. Refer to Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
We monitor our long-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment indicators on an on-going basis. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the long-lived asset group for recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset group to its net carrying value. If the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset group is written down to its fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Even if an impairment charge is not recognized, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets.

The basis of the recoverability test is our annual budget and three-year strategic plan. This includes a projection of future cash flows cost estimates; and (v) product life / business retention. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

While we believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and related assumptions are reasonable, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
We sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Our defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, mortality rates of participants, expected rates of mortality improvement, and health care cost trend rates.

The approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and international plans is based on high-quality corporate bonds. The weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for 2020 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:

------------------------------------------- ---------------- - -------------------- --- -------- --- -
 Pension Benefits Other Postretirement
 U.S. Non-U.S.
 Plans Plans Benefits
Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost 3.2 % 1.7 % 3.2 %
Used to calculate benefit obligations 2.3 % 1.5 % 2.5 %

Our approach to determining the assumption for the expected return on plan assets evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns. It is further adjusted for any expected changes in the long-term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets and for changes in the composition of pension plan assets. As a result, our estimate of the weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans decreased to 5.1% in 2020 from 5.4% in 2019.

Our pension plans generally do not require employee contributions. Our policy is to fund these pension plans in accordance with applicable domestic and international government regulations. At December 31, 2020, all legal funding requirements had been met.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.

Table of Contents

Warranty Reserves
We provide warranties on some, but not all, of our products. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OE products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax reporting values. Future tax benefits of net operating losses (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. In the event our operating performance deteriorates in a filing jurisdiction or entity, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 14, “Income Taxes”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.

In addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to complexity of some of these uncertainties and the effect of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
We are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk associated with our debt, and equity price risk associated with our share-based compensation awards.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We manufacture and sell our products in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products. We generally try to use natural hedges within our foreign currency activities, including the matching of revenues and costs, to minimize foreign currency risk. Where natural hedges are not in place, we consider managing certain aspects of our foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts. Principal currencies hedged have historically included the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Thailand bhat, South African rand, Mexican peso, and Canadian dollar.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
We enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third-party derivative contracts. The gains or losses on these contracts are recognized as foreign currency gains (losses) within “Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)” in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is recognized in “Prepayments and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these derivative instruments is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes by position the notional amounts for foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2020, all of which mature in the next twelve months (amounts in millions):

--------------- --------------- -----
 Notional Amount
Long positions $ 180
Short positions $ (176)

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. relative to all other currencies would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to translation of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

The following table summarizes the amounts of foreign currency translation and transaction losses:

Senior Secured Notes — We have foreign currency denominated debt, €344 million of which was designated as a net investment hedge in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of ours. As such, an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates will have no effect on earnings. For the portion not designated as a net investment hedge, we have other natural hedges in place that will offset any adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates.

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates between the euro and U.S. dollar would increase the amount of cash required to settle these notes by approximately $91 million as of December 31, 2020.

Commodity Price Risk
Our production processes are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials that are exposed to price fluctuations on the open market. Commodity rate price forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices for raw materials, principal raw materials hedged include copper, nickel, tin, zinc, and aluminum. The primary purpose of our commodity price forward contract activity is to manage the volatility associated with forecasted purchases for up to 18 months in the future. We monitor our commodity price risk exposures regularly to maximize the overall effectiveness of its commodity forward contracts. In certain instances, within this program, foreign currency forwards may be used in order to match critical terms for commodity exposure. The fair value of our commodity price forward contracts was a net asset position of $3 million on an equivalent notional amount of $10 million as of December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of commodity forward contracts.

Interest Rate Risk
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facility to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from five to ten years. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.7 billion par value of fixed rate debt and $3.5 billion par value of floating rate debt. Of the fixed rate debt, $653 million is fixed through 2024, $500 million is fixed through 2026, and $500 million is fixed through 2029. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Financing Arrangements” earlier in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2020 was about 99% of its book value. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates related to our variable interest rate debt would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $37 million.

Equity Price Risk
We selectively use swaps to reduce market risk associated with our deferred compensation liabilities, which increase as our stock price increases and decrease as our stock price decreases. We have entered into a cash-settled share swap agreement which moves in the opposite direction of these liabilities, allowing us to fix a portion of the liabilities at a stated amount. At December 31, 2020, we hedged our deferred compensation liability related to approximately 1,700,000 common share equivalents. We also have an S&P 500 index fund ETF swap agreement to further reduce our market risk, which will act as a natural hedge offsetting an equivalent amount of indexed investments in our deferred compensation plans. The fair value of these swap agreements is recorded in “Prepayments and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these derivative instruments is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.

['s corporate family rating is Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or higher from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BB- (with a stable outlook) or higher from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), the interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 2.75%; at any time the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the interest rate on the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 3.00%. When the Term Loan B and maintaining two or more corporate credit and/or corporate family ratings higher than or equal to BBB- from S&P, BBB- from Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and/or Baa3 from Moody’s (in each case, with a stable or positive outlook), the collateral under the New Credit Facility may be released. On June 3, 2019, Moody’s lowered our corporate family rating to B1 and the interest rate on borrowings under the term loan B was raised to LIBOR plus 3.00%.

New Credit Facility — Other Terms and Conditions
The New Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, and covenants which are customary for debt facilities of this type. The Third Amendment provided relief from the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and Term Loan A facility subject to the non-occurrence of certain covenant reset triggers (“Covenant Reset Triggers”) that limit certain of our activities by implementing more restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, as more fully described below. After giving effect to the Third Amendment, the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility include (i) a requirement to have a senior secured leverage ratio (as as follows:

------------------------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------------------- ---------------------
(i) Senior secured net leverage ratio (ii) Consolidated net leverage ratio
not greater than 6.75 to 1 at June 30, 2020 not greater than 4.50 to 1 at March 31, 2020
not greater than 9.50 to 1 at September 30, 2020 not greater than 5.25 to 1 at March 31, 2022
not greater than 8.75 to 1 at December 31, 2020 not greater than 4.75 to 1 at June 30, 2022
not greater than 8.25 to 1 at March 31, 2021 not greater than 4.25 to 1 at September 30, 2022
not greater than 4.50 to 1 at June 30, 2021 not greater than 3.75 to 1 thereafter
not greater than 4.25 to 1 at September 30, 2021
not greater than 4.00 to 1 at December 31, 2021
and (iii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1 as of March 31, 2020, 2.00 to 1 as of June 30, 2020, 1.50 to 1 through March 31, 2021, and 2.75 to 1 thereafter.

If a Covenant Reset Trigger occurs, the financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility revert back to the previous financial maintenance covenants in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment (the “Prior Financial Covenants”), including (i) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility), at the end of each fiscal quarter, with step-downs, as follows:

----------------------------------- --------------------------
(i) Consolidated net leverage ratio
not greater than 4.50 to 1 through March 31, 2021
not greater than 4.25 to 1 through September 30, 2021
not greater than 4.00 to 1 through March 31, 2022
not greater than 3.75 to 1 through September 30, 2022
not greater than 3.50 to 1 thereafter

and (ii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1.

In addition, we may make a one-time election to revert back to the Prior Financial Covenants and terminate the applicability of the Covenant Reset Triggers upon delivery of a covenant reset certificate to the administrative agent under the New Credit Facility that attests to compliance with the Prior Financial Covenants as of the end of the relevant fiscal period (“Covenant Reset Certificate”). Refer to Note 11, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details.

The Covenant Reset Triggers include certain limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (a) incur additional indebtedness, (b) enter into additional sales and leasebacks, (c) create additional liens over their assets, (d) pay dividends or distributions to Tenneco’s stockholders, (e) prepay certain unsecured indebtedness of us or our restricted subsidiaries (as more fully described below), (f) make additional investments, (g) dispose of material intellectual property, and (h) reinvest the proceeds of certain asset sales in the business in lieu of repaying indebtedness, each as more specifically described in the Third Amendment. These limitations are in addition to other affirmative and negative covenants (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers and limitations) in the New Credit Facility, including with respect to: financial reporting; payment of taxes; maintenance of existence; compliance with law and material contractual obligations; maintenance of property and insurance; inspection of property, books and records; notices of certain events; compliance with environmental laws; provision and maintenance of collateral perfection; satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants described above; incurrence of indebtedness; permitting liens over assets; mergers, consolidations, dispositions or other fundamental transactions; dispositions and asset sales; restricted payments; investments; compliance with limitations on certain transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates; sale and leaseback transactions; changes in fiscal periods; negative pledge clauses in certain contracts; changes to lines of business; prepayments and modifications of certain subordinated indebtedness (as more fully described below); use of proceeds; transactions involving special purpose finance subsidiaries; and transactions related to effectuating a spin-off (as defined in the New Credit Facility), each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

The Covenant Reset Triggers in the Third Amendment generally prohibit us from repaying the Senior Unsecured Notes. After giving effect to the Third Amendment, so long as no default exists under its New Credit Facility, we would be permitted to (i) make regularly scheduled interest and principal payments as and when due in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes, (ii) refinance the Senior Unsecured Notes with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (iii) make payments in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after May 5, 2020; (iv) convert any Senior Unsecured Notes into qualified capital stock issued after May 5, 2020; and (v) make additional payments of the Senior Unsecured Notes provided that after giving effect to such additional payments the consolidated leverage ratio would be equal to or less than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments. The foregoing limitations regarding repayment and refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Notes apply from the effectiveness of the Third Amendment until delivery of a Covenant Reset Certificate.

The covenants in the New Credit Facility generally prohibit us from repaying certain subordinated indebtedness. So long as no default exists, we would, under our New Credit Facility, be permitted to repay or refinance our subordinated indebtedness (i) with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (ii) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after October 1, 2018; (iii) in exchange for qualified capital stock issued after October 1, 2018; and (iv) with additional payments provided that such additional payments are capped based on a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio after giving effect to such additional payments.

Such additional payments on subordinated indebtedness (x) will not be permitted at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments and (y) will be permitted in an unlimited amount at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments.

The New Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, including, as a condition to future revolver borrowings, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of borrowing, including representations (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers and limitations) as to: existence; compliance with law; power, authority and enforceability; no violation of law or material contracts; material litigation; no default under the New Credit Facility and related documents; ownership of property, including material intellectual property; payment of material taxes; compliance with margin stock regulations; labor matters; ERISA; Investment Company Act matters; subsidiaries; use of loan proceeds; environmental matters; accuracy of information; security documents; solvency; anti-corruption laws and sanctions; and that since December 31, 2017 there has been no development or event that has had a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

Table of Contents

The New Credit Facility includes customary events of default and other provisions that could require all amounts due thereunder to become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the option of the lenders, if we fail to comply with the terms of the New Credit Facility or if other customary events occur. These events of default (with customary exceptions, materiality qualifiers, limitations and grace periods) include: (i) failure to pay obligations under the New Credit Facility when due; (ii) material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; (iii) failure to comply with the covenants in the New Credit Facility and related documents (as summarized above); (iv) cross-default to material indebtedness; (v) commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (vi) ERISA events; (vii) certain material judgments; (viii) invalidity or unenforceability of security and guarantee documents; and (ix) change of control, each as more specifically described in the New Credit Facility.

The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: senior secured net leverage ratio of 3.02 actual versus 8.75 (maximum required under the Third Amendment); and interest coverage ratio of 5.04 actual versus 2.75 (minimum required under the Third Amendment). The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.46 actual versus 4.00 (maximum without giving effect to the First Amendment, the Second Amendment or the Third Amendment); and interest coverage ratio of 5.38 actual versus 2.75 (minimum without giving effect to the First Amendment, the Second Amendment or the Third Amendment).

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79 ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...
