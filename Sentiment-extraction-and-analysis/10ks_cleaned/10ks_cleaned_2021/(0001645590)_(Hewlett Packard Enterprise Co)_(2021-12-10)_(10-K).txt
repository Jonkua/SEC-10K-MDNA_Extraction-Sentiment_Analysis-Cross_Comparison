TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES
COVID-19
While great progress has been made in the fight against COVID-19, it remains a global challenge and continues to have an impact on our operations. For a further discussion of the pandemic and the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to it, see the discussion in the section titled "COVID-19 Pandemic Update", "Manufacturing and Materials" and "Backlog" in Part I, Item 1, and risks identified in the section entitled " Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A.
The Company also believes that the pandemic has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities that are aligned with the Company's edge-to-cloud platform delivered as-a-service strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world have increased customers' needs for as-a-service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see opportunity to help our customers drive digital transformations as they continue to adapt to operate in a new world.

Other Trends and Uncertainties
We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the market shift of workloads to cloud-related IT infrastructure business models, emergence of software-defined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in IT consumption models. Certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Therefore, the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization.
Another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions, our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors.
A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. We intend to provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or subscription-based, pay-per-use and as-a-service offerings across our entire portfolio of HPE products and services.
Additionally, the global pandemic has accelerated several trends relevant to the Company. First, the exponential increase of data at the edge driven by the proliferation of devices. Second is the need for a cloud experience everywhere to manage the growth of data at the edge. Third, data growth is creating new opportunities with the need to quickly extract value from the captured data. Enterprises have embraced multi-cloud strategies, as they recognize the need for different cloud environments for different types of data and workloads. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform, while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense, by paying only for the IT they use.
In response to the aforementioned challenges and trends, we are accelerating growth in our areas of strategic focus, which include the Intelligent Edge and High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence ("HPC & AI") businesses while at the same time, we are strengthening our core Compute and Storage businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth, and accelerating our as-a-service pivot to become the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service choice for our customers and partners.
At the same time our transformation programs have improved our cost structure, channel execution and alignment of our sales coverage with our strategic goals. We continue to pursue new product innovations that build on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and wireless networking, which will keep us aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies.
Examples of accelerating and strengthening growth in our segments include the following:
•Intelligent Edge - we are seeing continued traction from our investment at the edge including rich software capabilities in security and edge services from HPE Aruba. The Aruba Edge Services Platform ("ESP") with Aruba’s built-in identity-based network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and secure access service edge. Our comprehensive portfolio and Artificial Intelligence-powered cloud-driven platforms, such as Aruba ESP and Aruba Central, will continue to accelerate WAN and security deployments, advance cloud and IoT adoption and fast-track digital transformation. We are on track to grow high-margin recurring revenue with technology that accelerates our ability to capture the high-growth WAN market opportunity. Additionally, we introduced a new class of cloud-native and fully automated data center switching products specifically designed for edge cloud data centers which represents a significant market opportunity for HPE.
•HPC & AI - enterprises are running analytics on increasingly large data sets and are adopting new techniques, such as AI, deep learning, and machine learning. They now will have access to HPC technologies, including exascale supercomputing systems, that were historically prohibitive due to their cost and complexity. HPE GreenLake cloud services is a flexible as-a-service platform that customers can run on-premises or in a colocation facility.
•Compute - our strategy to grow profitability and pivot to more as-a-service solutions is paying off. Compute includes three new HPE ProLiant Solutions targeting 5G deployments for telecommunication companies and virtual desktop infrastructure. We launched our new HPE 5G Open radio access network ("RAN") solution stack for telecommunications companies to accelerate the commercial adoption of Open RAN in 5G network deployments. This

is a transformative technology, featuring the industry’s first server-optimized for 5G Open RAN workloads with our HPE ProLiant Servers.
•Storage - we continue to see strength in key software defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services and provide data insights with our portfolio offerings. We introduced a new portfolio of cloud native data infrastructure called HPE Alletra which delivers workload optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise, from edge-to-cloud with our operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into a cloud-native software-defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions.
Annualized Revenue Run-rate ("ARR")
Our pivot to as-a-service continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our GreenLake Cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and include a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds.
ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from capital leases) and software-as-a-service, subscription, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue, and is not intended to be combined with it.
The following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2021 and 2020:

-------------------------- -------------------------------------- --- ---- --- - ---
 For the fiscal years ended October 31,
 2021 2020
 In millions
ARR $ 796 $ 585
year-over-year growth rate 36 % N/A

The 36% increase in ARR in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior-year period was due to growth in HPE GreenLake services and related financial services due to an expanding customer installed base. Additionally, ARR increased due to higher Intelligent Edge as-a-service activity, including Silver Peak, and growth in Storage as-a-service driven by Zerto, a recent acquisition.
The following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2020, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and Contractual Cash and Other Obligations discussions present information as of October 31, 2021, unless otherwise noted.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Net revenue of $27.8 billion represented an increase of 3.0% (increased 1.0% on a constant currency basis) due to a variety of factors including improvements in the overall demand environment from the prior-year period resulting in revenue growth across most of our segments, a strong order backlog at the beginning of the period, incremental revenue from the Silver Peak acquisition and favorable currency fluctuations. The revenue increase was moderated by a decrease in unit shipments due largely to industry-wide material constraints and a related challenging supply chain environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of order backlog across our hardware segments at the end of the current period. The gross profit margin of 33.7% represented an increase of 2.3 percentage points due to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline, cost savings from our transformation programs and a continued mix shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings. The operating profit margin of 4.1% represented an increase of 5.3 percentage points due primarily to our strong operational execution in fiscal 2021 and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which we recognized in fiscal 2020. We generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from operations (including $2.2 billion of after-tax cash from Oracle Corporation's satisfaction of a judgment in the Itanium breach of contract litigation) due to higher net earnings and improved working capital management. Free cash flow excluding the litigation judgment was $1.6 billion.

Returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework which consists of capital returns to shareholders and strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of October 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $4.3 billion, compared to the October 31, 2020 balance of $4.6 billion, representing a decrease of $0.3 billion. We maintain a $4.75 billion five year senior unsecured committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2019. As of October 31, 2021 no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
We believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.
The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs.
Significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
To recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price ("SSP") basis. We establish SSP for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. When the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. We establish SSP ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically.
Taxes on Earnings
We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 90 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our (Provision) benefit for taxes, Net earnings (loss) and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Combinations
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
In the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived most significantly from the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations, including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows. These cash flow projections are discounted to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.
On March 31, 2020, due to the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic on our projected future results of operations, we determined that an indicator of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units. The quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $865 million. As a result, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $865 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
During the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020, we determined that no additional impairment of goodwill existed.
Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, did not result in any additional impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 8% to 133% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, with the exception of HPC & AI reporting unit.
As of the annual test date, the HPC & AI reporting unit had a goodwill of $3.7 billion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 8%. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges on the current and projected future results as the revenue growth is dependent on timing of delivery and related achievement of customer acceptance milestones. If we are not successful in addressing these challenges, the projected revenue growth rates or operating margins could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit. The fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by changes in its weighted average cost of capital, changes in management's business strategy or significant and sustained declines in the stock price, which could result in an indicator of impairment. Further impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the potential impacts of the pandemic on the fair value of our assets.
Intangible Assets
We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the finite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach.
In March 2020, prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the HPC & AI reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired.
Contingencies
We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case.
Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, "Litigation and Contingencies", to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2021, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and doesn't adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

HPC & AI, Storage, and Financial Service, respectively. Compute net revenue was largely unchanged from the prior-year period.
The components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:

--------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ---- -----
 For the fiscal years ended October 31,
 2021 2020
 Percentage Points
Compute — (5.0)
HPC & AI 0.3 0.4
Storage 0.3 (2.0)
Intelligent Edge 1.6 (0.2)
Financial Services 0.2 (0.8)
Corporate Investments and Other 0.2 0.1
Total segment 2.6 (7.5)
Elimination of intersegment net revenue 0.4 0.1
Total HPE 3.0 (7.4)

Gross Profit
Our gross profit margin increased 2.3 percentage points due primarily to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline, cost savings from our transformation programs, a continued mix shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings and favorable currency fluctuations.
Operating expenses
Research and development
R&D expense increased by $105 million, or 6% due primarily to higher employee compensation expense which contributed 11.0 percentage points to the change. The increase was moderated by cost savings of 4.5 percentage points as we rationalize our R&D through transformation programs by focusing investment in growth areas.
Selling, general and administrative
SG&A expense increased by $305 million, or 7% due primarily to higher employee compensation expense and unfavorable currency fluctuations, which contributed 4.1 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points to the change, respectively.
Amortization of intangible assets
Amortization expense decreased by $25 million, or 7% due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization in the current period and higher write-offs of certain intangible assets in the prior-year period. The decrease was moderated by an increase in amortizations in the current period resulting from recent acquisitions.
Impairment of goodwill
Impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2020 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of $865 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit was below the carrying value of its net assets.
Transformation programs and costs
Our transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan (launched in 2020) and HPE Next initiative (launched in 2017). The cost optimization and prioritization plan focuses on realigning our workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy. The implementation period for the cost optimization and prioritization plan is through fiscal 2023. The HPE Next initiative was intended to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where we

participate by simplifying our operating model, streamlining our offerings, business processes and business systems to improve our execution. The implementation period for HPE Next was extended to fiscal 2023.
Transformation costs decreased by $20 million, or 2% due primarily to lower restructuring charges recorded in the current year, with higher IT costs and lower gains on real estate sales in the current period moderating the decrease.
Disaster charges
In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, disaster charges represent direct costs resulting from the pandemic and are primarily related to HPE hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored events which were converted to a virtual format or cancelled.
Acquisition, disposition and other related charges
Acquisition, disposition and other related charges decreased by $44 million due primarily to lower business acquisition costs related to retention bonuses and integration activities in the current year period.
Interest and other, net
Interest and other, net expense was relatively unchanged from period to period, due to offsetting factors with the current period including higher gains from equity investments, lower interest expense from lower average borrowings, and lower unfavorable currency fluctuations, offset by early debt redemption costs, lower gains on the sale of certain assets and lower interest income.
Tax indemnification and related adjustments
We record changes in certain pre-Separation tax liabilities for which we share joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement within Tax Indemnification and related Adjustments. We also record changes to certain pre-Separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification.
We recorded Tax indemnification and related adjustments income of $65 million and expense of $101 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2021 primarily included the impacts of a Brazilian Supreme Court decision received regarding the base on which two social contribution taxes in Brazil ("PIS" and "COFINS") are imposed. As a result of this decision, the Company is entitled to recover credits and associated interest related to the overpayment of these transaction taxes imposed between 2005 and 2019 to be used to offset future Brazilian tax liabilities. As such, we have recorded benefits of $17 million and $80 million, both net of taxes, for the recovery of PIS and COFINS, respectively, during fiscal 2021, of which $25 million was included in Net revenue, $10 million related to interest income was included in Interest and other, net, and $80 million related to pre-Separation liabilities was included in Tax indemnification and related adjustments. The corresponding income taxes of $18 million as a result of this recovery were included in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Tax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2020 resulted from changes in certain pre-Separation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables.
Non-service net periodic benefit credit
Non-service net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses. The credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or special termination benefits.
Non-service net periodic benefit credit decreased by $66 million due primarily to lower expected returns on plan assets.
Litigation judgment
In October 2021, the Company received $2.35 billion which represents Oracle Corporation's satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium breach of contract dispute. The gain was recognized as other income and presented as a Litigation judgment in

the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For further discussion, refer to Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Earnings from equity interests
Earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. Earnings from equity interests increased by $113 million due to higher net income earned by H3C and gains from certain venture investments.
(Provision) benefit for taxes
For fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $160 million and an income tax benefit of $120 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 4.5% and 27.1%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.
In fiscal 2021, we recorded $294 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:
•$180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,
•$157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,
•$39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes,
•$32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we share joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified by HP Inc.
•These benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.
In fiscal 2020, we recorded $362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:
• $174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,
•$66 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified by HP Inc.,
•$57 million of income tax benefits related to Indian distribution tax rate changes, and
• $40 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes.
•These discrete tax benefits were offset by $242 million of net income tax charges related to normal operations and the impact of the Company's goodwill impairment charge being non-deductible from a tax perspective.

Segment Information
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), who is the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), uses to evaluate, view and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.
In October 2021, we renamed the segment previously known as High Performance Computing and Mission Critical Solutions ("HPC & MCS") to High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence ("HPC & AI").

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
As described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we (a) excluded stock-based compensation expense from our segment earnings from operations; and (b) implemented certain organizational changes to align our segment financial reporting more closely with our current business structure. As a result of these organizational changes, our operations are now organized into six segments for financial reporting purposes: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, FS, and Corporate Investments and Other. The Corporate Investments and Other Segment now includes the A & PS operating segment, the Communications and Media Solutions operating segment, the Software operating segment, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs which is responsible for research and development. We reflected these changes in our segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for each of the segments. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated results.
A description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to Segments can be found in Note 2, "Segment Information", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020
Compute net revenue increased by $7 million, or 0.1% (decreased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in average unit prices. The net revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in unit shipments resulting from material constraints due to a challenging supply chain environment. As a result, we ended the period with a significantly higher level of order backlog.
From a product perspective, Compute experienced revenue growth in the rack and synergy server product categories partially moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their end-of-life. Services net revenue was relatively unchanged from period to period.

Table of Contents
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 2.6 percentage points due to decreases in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations, lower supply chain overhead costs from operational efficiencies, and disciplined pricing. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to cost savings from our transformation programs partially offset by higher employee compensation expense.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
Compute net revenue decreased by $1.4 billion, or 10.5% (decreased 9.4% on a constant currency basis) due to the impact of the pandemic on the demand environment as we experienced multiple factors including competitive pricing pressures, manufacturing capacity constraints in North America in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and unfavorable currency fluctuations. As a result, Compute experienced a decline in unit shipments and average unit selling prices.
Compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points due primarily to an increase in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to competitive pricing pressures, unfavorable currency fluctuations, higher supply chain costs and the scale of the net revenue decline, partially offset by lower commodity costs and a favorable mix. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the scale of the net revenue decline as total operating expenses declined due primarily to lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures and lower variable compensation expense, partially offset by higher field selling costs.

HPC & AI

Earnings from operations $ 234 $ 285 $ 365
Earnings from operations as a % of net revenue 7.3 % 9.2 % 12.2 %

Fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020
HPC & AI net revenue increased by $83 million or 2.7% (increased 1.8% on a constant currency basis) as the challenges encountered in the prior year period resulting from the pandemic receded, such as delays with meeting customer milestones, and the demand environment improved. This resulted in net revenue growth in the Apollo and Cray product categories within HPC and growth in Edge Compute. Favorable currency fluctuations also added to the net revenue increase. These increases were moderated by revenue declines in Data Solutions and Services due to certain products approaching their end-of-life and lower support services, respectively.
HPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points primarily due to increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a lower mix of revenue from services and higher-margin Data Solutions, while cost savings from our transformation programs moderated the increase. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher field selling costs and employee compensation expense, while cost savings from our transformation programs moderated the increase.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
HPC & AI net revenue increased by $122 million, or 4.1% (increased 4.4% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to higher revenue in HPC from the addition of product and services revenue resulting from the acquisition of Cray, partially offset by a revenue decline in Edge Compute and Data Solutions.
HPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by lower cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to an improved product mix resulting from Cray. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the addition of operating expenses from Cray.

Fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020
Storage net revenue increased by $78 million, or 1.7% (decreased 0.1% on a constant currency basis) as we continue our transition to more services, and software-rich offerings. The net revenue increase was led by favorable currency fluctuations, growth in Storage services and incremental revenue from the Zerto acquisition. Net revenue in Storage products was unchanged as growth from HPE Primera products, Traditional Storage and Nimble Storage was offset by revenue declines in SimpliVity and HPE 3PAR, while we are transitioning to the next-generation HPE Primera and HPE Alletra product set.
Storage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.1 percentage points due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a favorable mix of higher-margin HPE Primera and Big Data products, and improved operational efficiencies achieved through our transformation programs, the effects of which were partially offset by higher fixed overhead costs as a percentage of net revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased across all functions due to higher employee compensation expense and planned investments in our cloud data services.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
Storage net revenue decreased by $570 million, or 10.8% (decreased 9.9% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to the impact of the pandemic on the demand environment as we experienced commodity and manufacturing capacity constraints in North America in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and lower revenue from the expiration of a one-time legacy contract, partially offset by higher revenue from Big Data.
Storage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points due to an increase in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a combination of factors including competitive pricing pressures, increased cost of products due to higher fixed overhead cost, and unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower cost of services due to delivery efficiencies. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the scale of the net revenue decline while total operating expenses declined due to lower field selling costs amid lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures.

Intelligent Edge net revenue increased by $432 million, or 15.1% (increased 12.8% on a constant currency basis) from growth in product and services revenue due to an improved demand environment in the current period, the addition of revenue from Silver Peak and favorable currency fluctuations. The increase in product revenue was led by the Switching and WLAN product categories. The increase in services revenue was led by higher attached support services and increased as-a-service offerings.
Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.4 percentage points due primarily to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower product costs in Switching and WLAN and addition of higher-margin Silver Peak activity. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to improved operational efficiencies including cost savings from transformation programs, while higher employee compensation expense and the addition of expenses from Silver Peak moderated the decrease.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
Intelligent Edge net revenue decreased by $58 million, or 2.0% (decreased 1.2% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to weak market demand, competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable currency fluctuations. As a result, we experienced lower revenue from WLAN, switching products, and software offerings. These declines were partially offset by an increase in net revenue due to higher service renewals.
Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 4.4 percentage points due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue coupled with lower cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a favorable mix of revenue from services and lower costs of switching products, partially offset by higher logistics cost. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower spending as a result of cost containment measures, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.

Fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020
FS net revenue increased by $49 million, or 1.5% (decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating lease assets, along with lower asset management revenue from lease buyouts.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.0 percentage points due primarily to lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from lower borrowing costs while operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
FS net revenue decreased by $229 million, or 6.4% (decreased 5.2% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating leases assets and lower lease equipment buyout revenue, along with unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher revenue from lease extensions.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.2 percentage points due primarily to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted from lower depreciation expense and borrowing costs, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The increase to operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower capitalized initial direct costs as a result of adopting the new lease accounting standard.

 For the fiscal years ended October 31,
 2021 2020 2019
 Dollars in millions
Financing volume $ 6,168 $ 6,005 $ 6,200

Financing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 2.7% in fiscal 2021 and decreased 3.1% in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior-year periods. The increase in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by favorable currency fluctuations, along with higher financing associated with third-party product sales and related service offerings. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to lower financing associated with both third-party and HPE product sales and related service offerings, along with unfavorable currency fluctuations.
Portfolio Assets and Ratios
The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------- ------ ---- ------ - ------
 As of October 31,
 2021 2020
 Dollars in millions
Financing receivables, gross $ 9,198 $ 9,058
Net equipment under operating leases 4,001 4,027

Net portfolio assets $ 13,303 $ 13,274
Reserve coverage 2.0 % 1.6 %
Debt-to-equity ratio(3) 7.0x 7.0x

(1)Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.
(2)Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.
(3)Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.9 billion and $11.7 billion at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at both October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020 was $1.7 billion.
As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, FS net cash and cash equivalents were $898 million and $729 million, respectively.
Net portfolio assets as of October 31, 2021 increased 0.2% from October 31, 2020. The increase generally resulted from favorable currency fluctuations, largely offset by portfolio runoff exceeding new financing volume during the period.
FS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $95 million, $93 million and $75 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Corporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 8.9 percentage points due primarily to a decrease in cost of services and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to service delivery and overhead efficiencies achieved through our transformation programs. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower spending resulting from cost containment measures.
Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
Corporate Investments and Other net revenue increased by $10 million, or 0.8% (increased 1.2% on a constant currency basis) due to higher revenue from Software partially offset by lower revenue from A & PS and CMS, and unfavorable currency fluctuations.
Corporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 8.5 percentage points due to a decrease in costs of services and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of services was due primarily to lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Overview
We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisition and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. We continue to monitor the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and other global economies, the capital markets, consumer behavior, our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 7A, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held outside the U.S as of October 31, 2021. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.
Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
As a result of increased uncertainty due to the pandemic, purchases under our share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, were temporarily suspended in April, 2020. We resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and settled $213 million of our stock. As of October 31, 2021, we had a remaining authorization of $1.9 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, "Stockholders' Equity", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.6 billion, for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings, which includes a $2.2 billion litigation judgment.
Our key working capital metrics were as follows:

Cash conversion cycle 3 (7) (22)

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management's Discussion and Analysis of

The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of sales and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity.
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, DSO increased due primarily to a decrease in early payments and factoring, extended payments terms and unfavorable billing linearity.
DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, the DOS increased due primarily to higher levels of inventory resulting from a combination of supply chain constraints, positioning of inventory to fulfill planned future shipments and strategic purchases of certain key components.
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, DPO increased due primarily to higher inventory purchases for planned future shipments and extended payment terms.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.2 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to higher cash utilized for investment in property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds of $0.5 billion and higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.1 billion, partially offset by lower payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of $0.4 billion.
Financing Activities
Net cash generated in financing activities decreased by $4.2 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease was due primarily to lower proceeds from debt issuance of $4.0 billion, higher cash utilized for debt repayment of $0.4 billion and lower cash utilized for share repurchase of $0.1 billion.

Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 354 703 597
Free Cash Flow $ 1,551 $ 560 $ 1,738

Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less investments in property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. In fiscal 2021, free cash flow does not include $2.2 billion of after-tax cash impact from Oracle’s satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation. Free cash flow increased by $1.0 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was due to higher cash generated from operations and improved net working capital moderated by increased cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds.
Our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position help to ensure we have ample liquidity to run operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.

Long-term debt $ 9,896 $ 12,186 $ 9,395
Weighted-average interest rate 2.9 % 3.2 % 4.1 %

We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure.
For more information on the activity for fiscal 2021 relating to Unsecured Senior Notes and Asset-Backed Debt Securities, see Note 14, "Borrowings", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Commercial Paper
We maintain two commercial paper programs, "the Parent Programs", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. Our U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $4.75 billion which was increased from $4.0 billion in March 2020. Our euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed $4.75 billion as authorized by our Board of Directors. In addition, our subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. As of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Parent Programs, and $705 million and $677 million, respectively, were outstanding under our subsidiary's program. During fiscal 2021, we issued $757 million and repaid $728 million of commercial paper.
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, "Financial Instruments", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
In December 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these securities.
Revolving Credit Facility
We maintain a $4.75 billion five year senior unsecured committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2019. Loans under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including support of the commercial paper program. Commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a period of five years, which period may be extended, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, by up to two, one-year periods. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's external credit rating. As of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

CONTRACTUAL CASH AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS
In fiscal 2020 the total of our contractual cash and other obligations was $20.8 billion and in fiscal 2021 totals $17.9 billion. Hence we do not currently expect changes to our contractual cash and other obligations to significantly impact our free cash flow expectations.
Our contractual cash and other obligations as of October 31, 2021, were as follows:

(1)Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt, and do not include fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. As of October 31, 2021, the future principal payments related to asset-backed debt securities were expected to be $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022, $0.7 billion in fiscal 2023 and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2024. For more information on our debt, see Note 14, "Borrowings", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(2)Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2021 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.
(3)Amounts include uncommenced operating leases as of fiscal 2021 and do not reflect imputed interest adjustments.
(4)For additional information on our Unconditional Purchase Obligations, see Note 19, "Commitments", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(5)In fiscal 2022, we anticipate making contributions of $199 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, "Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(6)As of October 31, 2021, we expect future cash payments of approximately $0.8 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes $0.5 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2022 and $0.3 billion expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash

outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, "Transformation Programs", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(7)As of October 31, 2021, we had approximately $428 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $68 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, "Balance Sheet Details", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS
Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense from its segment earnings from operations results and excluded stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. The Company has reflected this change retrospectively to its financial results for the earliest period presented. This change had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated GAAP results. However, the Company reflected the change resulting from the reclassification of its stock-based compensation expense by restating its consolidated non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per share.
The following tables provide reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures for fiscal 2021 and 2020:

Non-GAAP financial measures
The non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (Earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash flow from operations and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid, is cash flow from operations.
Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin is defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and certain acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net

revenue) consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, early debt redemption costs, earnings from equity interests, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of U.S. tax reform, structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. We believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments. Management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results, and excluding them facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers. The excluded items can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and/or not reflective of the operational performance of the business.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures, they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets.
We compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. We believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Term Loan In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan ("Term Loan") with a maturity date of April 30, 2020. The Term Loan ranked equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. There were no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the Term Loan could be prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%.

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. ​ Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. ​ 133 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in "Elimination of Dual Credit"). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/be...

(4)Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling $70.0 million as of November 30, 2020, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduces our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2020, we had access to 119,283 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2020, we had $414.2 million of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $87.5 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts. At November 30, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 billion (which included the $87.5 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2020, we had outstanding surety bonds of $3.1 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2020, there were approximately $1.6...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79 ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

[refer to the section "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations"]:
Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense from its segment earnings from operations results and excluded stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. The Company has reflected this change retrospectively to its financial results for the earliest period presented. This change had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated GAAP results. However, the Company reflected the change resulting from the reclassification of its stock-based compensation expense by restating its consolidated non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per share.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Net revenue of $27.8 billion represented an increase of 3.0% (increased 1.0% on a constant currency basis) due to a variety of factors including improvements in the overall demand environment in significantly higher levels of order backlog across our hardware segments at the end of the current period. The gross profit margin of 33.7% represented an increase of 2.3 percentage points due to of 4.1% represented an increase of 5.3 percentage points due primarily to our strong operational execution in fiscal 2021 and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which we recognized in fiscal 2020. We generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from operations (including $2.2 billion of after-tax cash from Oracle Corporation']:

CONTRACTUAL CASH AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS
In fiscal 2020 the total of our contractual cash and other obligations was $20.8 billion and in fiscal 2021 totals $17.9 billion. Hence we do not currently expect changes to our contractual cash and other obligations to significantly impact our free cash flow expectations.
Our contractual cash and other obligations as of October 31, 2021, were as follows:

(1)Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt, and do not include fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. As of October 31, 2021, the future principal payments related to asset-backed debt securities were expected to be $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022, $0.7 billion in fiscal 2023 and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2024.

(2)Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2021 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.
(3)Amounts include uncommenced operating leases as of fiscal 2021 and do not reflect imputed interest adjustments.

Note 8.Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

(5)In fiscal 2022, we anticipate making contributions of $199 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes.

[the section titled "COVID-19 Pandemic Update"]:
While great progress has been made in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or "pandemic"), it remains a global challenge. In fiscal 2021, due to an unprecedented demand for electronic devices and related industry-wide supply constraints, the global economy encountered a challenging supply chain environment. The pandemic continues to have an impact on our financial performance and we are currently unable to predict the extent to which it may adversely impact our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to COVID-19, see risks identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A. In 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered, and beginning October 4, 2021, we adopted a policy to require proof of vaccination from HPE personnel, contingent workers, and guests in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local laws and regulations and on the timeline determined appropriate for the geography (as of end of fiscal 2021, the policy was operationalized only in the U.S.). On October 20, 2021, we updated our vaccination policy to require vaccination as a condition of employment for all HPE personnel covered by President Biden's executive order, effective January 18, 2022. We recognize that there are existing legal challenges to the executive order, and we will ensure that the timing and scope of the implementation of our vaccination requirement is consistent with the legal status of the executive order. We are committed to help support costs for the vaccine through HPE health benefits or other programs, to the extent not covered by government programs, medical plans or other sources. Our Strategy The pace of technology disruption continues to increase, and the pandemic has accelerated several megatrends. First, data at the edge is increasing exponentially, driven by the proliferation of device...

[", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
We believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.
The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs.
Significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers']:

Earnings from operations as a % of net revenue 10.8 % 8.2 % 12.5 %

Fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020
Compute net revenue increased by $7 million, or 0.1% (decreased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in average unit prices. The net revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in unit shipments resulting from material constraints due to a challenging supply chain environment. As a result, we ended the period with a significantly higher level of order backlog.
From a product perspective, Compute experienced revenue growth in the rack and synergy server product categories partially moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their end-of-life. Services net revenue was relatively unchanged from period to period.
