Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash Flows — Operating Activities
Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operations was $1.31 billion, a decrease of $4.35 billion compared to $3.04 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The main factor driving this decrease was the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, which significantly reduced visitation to our properties and caused the temporary shutdown of all of our properties at various times during 2020 as described above. The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted our working capital, which was a cash outflow during the year ended December 31, 2020 as the amount of receivables collected was less than the settlement of operating accrued liabilities and the outstanding chip liability was significantly reduced in 2020. In addition, cash flow from operations in the prior year were impacted by the land lease payment made in 2019 in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.

Cash Flows — Investing Activities
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $1.33 billion, including $1.06 billion in Macao, which consisted of $739 million for The Londoner Macao, $157 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons and $140 million for The Venetian Macao; $164 million in Singapore; $103 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; and $5 million for corporate and other activities.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled $1.22 billion, including $762 million in Macao, which consisted of $298 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, $282 million for The Londoner Macao and $131 million for The Venetian Macao; $198 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; $195 million in Singapore; and $61 million for corporate and other activities.
Cash Flows — Financing Activities
Net cash flows generated from financing activities were $560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily attributable to the issuance of $1.50 billion of unsecured notes at SCL, partially offset by $911 million in dividend payments.
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily attributable to $3.0 billion in dividend payments, $754 million in common stock repurchases and $132 million in payments of financing costs, partially offset by proceeds of $495 million from the issuance of the 2025 LVSC Senior Notes.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.96 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore revolving facilities, net of letters of credit. Additionally, we had $2.79 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility to finance construction costs incurred in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.
Capital Financing Overview
We fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments (see "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 8 — Long-Term Debt") and operating cash flows.
In June 2020, SCL issued, in a private offering, two series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion. The net proceeds from the offering were used for incremental liquidity and general corporate purposes. (see "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 8 — Long-Term Debt — Corporate and U.S. Related Debt — SCL Senior Notes").
Our U.S., SCL and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio or net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined. In September 2020, LVSC entered into an amendment, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, removed LVSC’s requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio as of the last day of the fiscal quarter during the period beginning on October 31, 2020, through and including December 31, 2021. In March 2020, SCL entered into a waiver and amendment request letter, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, waived SCL’s requirement to ensure the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.0x and the interest coverage ratio is greater than 2.50x for any period beginning on, and including, January 1, 2020 and ending on, and including, July 1, 2021 (other than with respect to the financial year ended December 31, 2019). In September 2020, SCL entered into a waiver extension and amendment request letter, pursuant to which the aforementioned waiver period was extended to January 1, 2022. In June 2020, MBS entered into an amendment letter, such that MBS will not have to comply with the leverage or interest coverage covenants for the financial quarters ending, and including, September 30, 2020 through, and including, December 31, 2021.
Any defaults under our debt agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. If the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance we would be able to repay or refinance any

amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2.12 billion and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $16 million as of December 31, 2020, of which approximately $1.21 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $1.21 billion, approximately $946 million is available to be repatriated to the U.S., and we do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. The remaining unrestricted amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL. We believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $3.96 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and SGD 3.69 billion (approximately $2.79 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2020) under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility, as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities and debt obligations. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure. On January 25, 2021, we increased the amount available under the SCL revolving credit facility by HKD 3.83 billion (approximately $494 million in exchange rates in effect at the time of transaction) to further enhance our liquidity. Subsequently, on January 29, 2021 SCL drew down $29 million and HKD 2.13 billion (approximately $274 million at exchange rates in effect on January 29, 2021) under this facility for general corporate purposes, resulting in remaining available borrowing capacity of $2.21 billion.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and recorded $603 million as a distribution against retained earnings.
On February 21, 2020, SCL paid a dividend of 0.99 HKD to SCL stockholders (a total of $1.03 billion, of which we retained $717 million during the year ended December 31, 2020).
We have suspended our quarterly dividend program and SCL did not pay a final dividend for 2019 due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2.50 billion of our outstanding common stock, which was to expire in November 2020. In October 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the extension of the expiration date of the remaining repurchase amount of $916 million to November 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program. All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

(1)As of December 31, 2020, we had a $71 million liability related to uncertain tax positions; we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.
(2)See "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 8 — Long-Term Debt" for further details on these financing transactions and "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 13 — Leases" for further details on finance leases.
(3)Based on the 1-month rate as of December 31, 2020, Singapore Swap Offer Rate ("SOR") of 0.13% plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements.
(4)We are party to certain operating leases for real estate and various equipment, which primarily include $331 million related to long-term land leases in Macao with an anticipated lease term of 50-years, $132 million related to a 99-year lease agreement (83 years remaining) for a parking structure located adjacent to The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and $70 million related to certain leaseback agreements related to the sale of the Grand Canal Shoppes. See "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 13 — Leases" for further details on operating leases.
(5)Mall deposits consist of refundable security deposits received from mall tenants.
(6)In addition to the 39% gross gaming win tax in Macao (which is not included in this table as the amount we pay is variable in nature), we are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. Based on the gaming tables and gaming machines in operation as of December 31, 2020, the annual premium payable to the Macao government is approximately $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $21 million through the termination of the gaming subconcession in June 2022.

(7)Primarily consists of all other non-cancellable contractual obligations and primarily relates to certain hotel and restaurant management and service agreements. The amounts exclude open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received as these agreements generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions.

Restrictions on Distributions
We are a parent company with limited business operations. Our main asset is the stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. Certain of our debt instruments contain restrictions that, among other things, limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or equity interests, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase equity interests or certain indebtedness, create certain liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain mergers or consolidations or sell certain assets of our Company without prior approval of the lenders or noteholders.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Provision for Expected Credit Losses
We maintain a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluate the balances. We apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. The reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. We also specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information and adjust the aforementioned reserve with the results from the individual reserve analysis. We also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts, which include the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there has been a delay in payments on casino receivables due to the inability of patrons to travel to our properties or to accomplish financial transactions due to the travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic. The collection of casino receivables has also been impacted by liquidity issues faced by certain patrons also stemming from the COVID-19 Pandemic. We have increased the provision for credit losses in each jurisdiction accordingly to account for the expected credit losses due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Although we believe the provision on our casino receivables is adequate as of December 31, 2020, it is possible our provisions could increase if we experience further delays on payments from patrons.
Account balances are written off against the provision when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Credit or marker play was 24.0%, 14.6% and 68.8% of table games play at our Macao properties, Marina Bay Sands and Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our provision for casino credit losses was 58.3% and 32.3% of gross casino receivables as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The credit extended to gaming promoters can be offset by the commissions payable to said gaming promoters, which is considered in the establishment of the provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
Litigation Accrual
We are subject to various claims and legal actions. We estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Property and Equipment
As of December 31, 2020, we had net property and equipment of $15.11 billion, representing 72.6% of our total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal

63

Table of Contents

considerations, such as contractual life. Future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. The estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis.
For assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). Secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. We estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
To estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. Determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. Future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.
Due to the substantial reduction in cash flows generated from our operating properties and the ongoing travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we determined a triggering event occurred in 2020 and an impairment assessment was warranted for our asset groups in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas. We tested our long-lived assets held for use at our operating properties in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas for recoverability as of December 31, 2020, resulting in no impairment as the estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded their carrying values. We believe we made reasonable estimates and judgments in performing the analysis in light of the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, should the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic persist for a prolonged duration and projected operating results further decline in future periods, we could be required to recognize an impairment loss.
For assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. Any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. Fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Our foreign and U.S. tax rate differential reflects the fact that U.S. tax rates are higher than the statutory tax rates in Singapore and Macao of 17% and 12%, respectively. In August 2018, we received an additional exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expires. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for an annual payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2020) that is a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming

profits. We intend to request extensions of these tax arrangements; however, there is no assurance we will receive these extensions.
Accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring and tax planning strategies.
We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $342 million and $279 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations of $4.58 billion and $4.51 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the resulting reduction in estimated royalty income from an expected decrease in our Macao and Singapore operations, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain U.S. foreign tax credits, which we no longer expect to utilize during the period 2021 through 2027 before their expiration. We believe we made reasonable estimates and judgments in performing the analysis in light of the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, should the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic persist for a prolonged duration, we could be required to record additional valuation allowances. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. To the extent the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made, as appropriate.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. We recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $131 million and $134 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Macao, and Singapore. We could be subject to examination for tax years beginning in 2016 in Macao and Singapore and tax years 2010 through 2015 and 2017 through 2019 in the U.S.
U.S. tax reform made significant changes to U.S. income tax laws including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% effective beginning in 2018 and transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system resulting in dividends from our foreign subsidiaries not being subject to U.S. income tax and therefore, no longer generating U.S. foreign tax credits.

['s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash Flows — Operating Activities
Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operations was $1.31 billion, a decrease of $4.35 billion compared to $3.04 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The main factor driving this decrease was the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, which significantly reduced visitation to our properties and caused the temporary shutdown of all of our properties at various times during 2020 as described above. The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted our working capital, which was a cash outflow during the year ended December 31, 2020 as the amount of receivables collected was less than the settlement of operating accrued liabilities and the outstanding chip liability was significantly reduced in 2020. In addition, cash flow from operations in the prior year were impacted by the land lease payment made in 2019 in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly c...

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Provision for Expected Credit Losses
We maintain a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluate the balances. We apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. The reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. We also specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer']:
(5)As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. (6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)This primarily reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. 28  EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjuste...
