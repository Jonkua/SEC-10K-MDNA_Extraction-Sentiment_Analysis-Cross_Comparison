ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION
In Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for STERIS and its subsidiaries including:
•what factors affect our business;
•what our earnings and costs were;
•why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•where our earnings came from;
•how this affects our overall financial condition;
•what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
The MD&A also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As you read the MD&A, it may be helpful to refer to information in Item 1, “Business,” Item 6, “Selected Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements, which present the results of our operations for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 as well as Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. This information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS.

FINANCIAL MEASURES
In the following sections of the MD&A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows:
•Backlog – We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•Debt-to-total capital – We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•Days sales outstanding (“DSO”) – We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
We, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD&A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Information on our financial condition and results of our operations for our 2020 fiscal year period can be found in Exhibit 99.1 titled, "Updates to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020", of our Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2021.

REVENUES– DEFINED
As required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues:
•Revenues – Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•Product Revenues – We define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•Service Revenues – We define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment.
•Capital Equipment Revenues – We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, including SYSTEM 1 and 1E, washing systems, VHP® technology, water stills, and pure steam generators; surgical lights and tables; and integrated OR.
•Consumable Revenues – We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes SYSTEM 1 and 1E consumables, V-PRO consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, skin care products, cleaning consumables, barrier product solutions and surgical instruments.
•Recurring Revenues – We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.

GENERAL OVERVIEW AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science products and services around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("GI") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration.
On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”). Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK.
We operate and report in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences. We describe our business segments in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "Business Segment Information."
The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. During fiscal 2021, we experienced reduced demand for certain products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures and increased demand for other products and services from our pharmaceutical Customers focused on vaccines and biologics and increased demand in the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment for personal protective equipment product services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the COVID-19 pandemic please refer to the subsection below, titled "COVID-19 Pandemic".

Acquisitions. On November 18, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding units and equity of Key Surgical, LLC ("Key Surgical"). Key Surgical is a global provider of sterile processing, operating room and endoscopy consumable products serving hospitals and surgical facilities. Key Surgical is being integrated into our Healthcare segment. The total purchase price of the acquisition was $853.2 million, net of cash acquired, and remains subject to customary working capital adjustments.
On January 4, 2021, we purchased the remaining outstanding shares of an equity investment that we initially made in fiscal 2019. Total consideration was approximately $78.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to any working capital adjustments. Total non-cash consideration for this transaction was $41.8 million, which consisted of the settlement of outstanding principal and interest on a loan receivable, the initial equity investment, and receivables related to capital equipment purchases that existed at the acquisition date. The business is being integrated into our Applied Sterilization Technologies business segment and we funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and credit facility borrowings.
We also completed two other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2021, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Healthcare segment. Total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $20.9 million, net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of $1.2 million.
On January 12, 2021, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Cantel Medical Corp. (NYSE: CMD "Cantel"), through a U.S. subsidiary. Cantel is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental Customers. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire Cantel in a cash and stock transaction valued at $84.66 per Cantel common share, based on STERIS’s closing share price of $200.46 on January 11, 2021. This represents a total equity value of approximately $3.6 billion and a total enterprise value of approximately $4.6 billion. The agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. We expect to fund the cash portion of the transaction consideration and repay or otherwise satisfy a significant amount of Cantel’s existing debt obligations with approximately $2.1 billion of new debt, which is described in Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, titled "Debt". Cantel shareholder vote and regulatory approvals have been obtained and the acquisition is expected to occur on June 2, 2021.
Divestitures. During fiscal 2021, we sold an Applied Sterilization Technologies laboratory that was located in the Netherlands. We recorded proceeds of $0.5 million, net of cash divested, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $2.0 million in the selling, general and administrative expense line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The business generated annual revenues of approximately $6.0 million.
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020. The pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including deferral of surgical procedures and treatments and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures, have negatively affected and are expected to continue to negatively affect some of our operations, which may impact our financial position and cash flows. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services, including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand. To date, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations, as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our Customers. During fiscal 2021, in response to the to the pandemic, we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees, preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility.We allowed employees to work remotely when possible and implemented additional safety measures in compliance with applicable regulations to allow personnel to continue to work in our facilities. We suspended all non-essential travel and enacted a temporary hiring freeze on certain positions. To manage liquidity, we suspended our stock repurchase program and deferred certain planned capital expenditures; however, we continued to invest in expansion projects as planned. We do not believe that these actions will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations.
Highlights.  Revenues increased $76.6 million, or 2.5%, to $3,107.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $3,030.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase reflects organic growth in the Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences segments and favorable fluctuations in currencies, which were partially offset by a decline in the Healthcare segment. Growth in the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment was primarily due to volume. Growth in the Life Sciences segment was due to increased demand for our products and services from our pharmaceutical Customers focused on vaccines and biologics. The decline in the Healthcare segment was primarily due to reduced demand for our products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced capital spending by Customers in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Healthcare decline was partially offset by the impact of our recent acquisitions and the recognition of $14.6 million of capital equipment revenues that were previously deferred, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (for more information regarding this change refer to Note 1 of the consolidated statements, titled "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies").

Table of Contents
Our gross profit percentage decreased slightly to 43.2% for fiscal 2021 as compared to 43.6% for fiscal 2020. The unfavorable impact of incremental costs associated with COVID-19 (60 basis points), unfavorable fluctuations in currencies (10 basis points) and mix and other adjustments (20 basis points), more than offset favorable pricing (50 basis points).
Fiscal 2021 operating income increased 2.1% to $548.4 million over fiscal 2020 operating income of $537.0 million. This increase was primarily attributable to higher gross margin attainment. Additional expenses from our recent acquisitions were partially offset by reduced selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses during fiscal 2021, as certain expenses were suspended or decreased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Net cash flows from operations were $689.6 million and free cash flow was $450.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to net cash flows from operations of $590.6 million and free cash flow of $380.2 million in fiscal 2020 (see subsection of MD&A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures). The fiscal 2021 increases in cash flows from operations and free cash flow were primarily due to working capital improvements, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures.
 Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 29.8% at March 31, 2021. During the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the fifteenth consecutive year to $0.40 per share per quarter.
Outlook. In fiscal 2022 and beyond, we expect to continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services. In this regard, we are working diligently on the closing of our acquisition of Cantel Medical, which we continue to expect to occur on June 2, 2021.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. The following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:

-------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ------- ---- --------- - -------
 Years Ended March 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2021 2020

Purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangibles, net (239,262) (214,516)
Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment and intangibles 569 4,156
Free cash flow $ 450,947 $ 380,199

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. SG&A increased 2.0% in fiscal 2021 over fiscal 2020, largely due to our recent acquisitions. Volume and performance driven employee compensation costs and travel and meeting costs have declined in the fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures we have taken in response to it.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased $0.8 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, due primarily to increased spending within the Healthcare Products segment. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. During fiscal 2021, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
Restructuring Expenses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in Brazil and one in England, as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products. Fewer than 200 positions were eliminated. The Company relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. These restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency.
Since inception of the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $40.8 million related to these restructuring actions, of which $28.7 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $12.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues, with a total of $33.9 million, $4.5 million and $0.7 million related to the Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences segments, respectively. Corporate related restructuring charges were $1.8 million. Additional restructuring expenses related to this plan are not expected to be material to our results of operations.

Interest income and miscellaneous expense (6,345) (1,987) (4,358)
Non-operating expenses, net $ 30,835 $ 38,292 $ (7,457)

Interest expense decreased $3.1 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and an increased amount of capitalized interest expensed (refer to our Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "Debt", for more information). Interest (income) and miscellaneous expense changed by $4.4 million primarily due to movement on our equity investments (refer to our Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "Fair Value Measurements" for more information).
Additional information regarding our outstanding debt is included in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Debt,” and in the subsection of this MD&A titled, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Effective income tax rate 23.3 % 18.2 %

*Certain amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 23.3% as compared to 18.2% for fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 effective tax rate increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increased percentage of profits earned and taxed in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate.
Business Segment Results of Operations. We operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences. Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income.
Our Healthcare segment offers infection prevention and procedural products and services for healthcare providers worldwide, including consumable products, equipment maintenance and installation services, and capital equipment. The segment also provides a range of specialty services for healthcare providers including hospital sterilization services and instrument and scope repairs.
Our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment provides contract sterilization and testing services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Our Life Sciences segment designs, manufactures and sells consumable products, equipment maintenance, specialty services and capital equipment primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers around the world.
We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company.
For more information regarding our segments please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled “Business Segment Information,” and Item 1, “Business”.

Healthcare revenues decreased 1.6% in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, reflecting declines in capital equipment and service revenues of 4.7% and 3.2%, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in consumable revenues of 5.0%. The declines in capital equipment and services revenues were primarily due to reduced demand for our products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced capital spending by Customers in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluctuations in currencies and the impact from our recent acquisitions were favorable during fiscal 2021. Consumable revenues increased during fiscal 2021, as procedure volumes continued to rebound during the second half of fiscal 2021. At March 31, 2021, the Healthcare segment’s backlog amounted to $206.3 million, increasing 21.3%, as compared to the backlog of $170.1 million at March 31, 2020. Fiscal 2021 backlog was impacted by the recognition of capital equipment revenues that were previously deferred, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (for more information regarding this change refer to Note 1 of the consolidated statements, titled "Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies").
Applied Sterilization Technologies revenues increased 9.4% in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase reflects organic growth and favorable fluctuations in currencies.

Life Sciences revenues increased 12.1% in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, reflecting growth in consumable, capital equipment and service revenues of 15.6%, 13.8% and 5.0%, respectively. The increase reflects organic growth, favorable pricing, and favorable fluctuations in currencies.

The Healthcare segment’s operating income increased $6.4 million to $427.1 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $420.7 million in fiscal year 2020. The segment's operating margins were 21.9% for fiscal year 2021 and 21.2% for fiscal year 2020. The increases in the fiscal 2021 period were primarily due to favorable impact from our recent acquisitions and reduced expenditures, including reductions in travel and meeting spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employee compensation associated with the Healthcare segment was also reduced due to lower volumes and measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Applied Sterilization Technologies segment’s operating income increased $39.7 million to $310.6 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $270.9 million in fiscal year 2020. The Applied Sterilization Technologies segment's operating margins were 45.3% for fiscal year 2021 and 43.2% for fiscal year 2020. The increases in the fiscal 2021 period were primarily due to higher volumes and reduced expenditures, including reductions in travel and meeting spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Life Sciences business segment’s operating income increased $36.7 million to $180.8 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $144.1 million in fiscal year 2020. The segment’s operating margins were 38.7% for fiscal year 2021 and 34.6% for fiscal year 2020. These increases in the fiscal 2021 period were primarily due to higher volumes and favorable mix.

To the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities.

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the Issuer and ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to service the Senior Notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.
The following is a summary of these guarantees:
Guarantees of Senior Notes
•Parent Company Guarantor – STERIS plc
•Subsidiary Issuer – STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company
•Subsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Limited
•Subsidiary Guarantor – STERIS Corporation
The guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:
•in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any Material Credit Facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances);
•upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture;
•as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or
•in the case of the Parent, if the Issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any Material Credit Facility of the Issuer terminate upon the Issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Parent; and
•upon such Guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with.
The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
The following tables present summarized results of operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 and summarized balance sheet information at March 31, 2021 for the obligor group of the Senior Notes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Estimates and Assumptions.  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. These estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. We periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition.  Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the Customer. Revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. Product revenue is recognized when control passes to the Customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. Service revenue is recognized when the Customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the Customer. Our Customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. Our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. Our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are included in Product revenues. The associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of revenues. Revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from Customers.
We have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. The reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. Estimated returns are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the Customer. We allocate

41

Table of Contents
the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
Payment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
We do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
Certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At March 31, 2021 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable.  We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by Customers. We estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, Customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. We also analyze significant Customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific Customer’s inability to pay. As a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. These analyses require judgment. If the financial condition of our Customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
Allowance for Sales Returns.  We maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. We estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience.
Inventories and Reserves. Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost method. Inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead.
We review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. We record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. If future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
Asset Impairment Losses.  Property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. We conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income during that period.
When we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
Asset Retirement Obligations. We incur retirement obligations for certain assets. We record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations (ARO) at fair value. Accounting for the ARO at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. We provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Property, Plant and Equipment.”
Restructuring.  We record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, and contractual obligations. Actual amounts could differ from the original estimates. We review our restructuring-related accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period the change is identified.
Purchase Accounting and Goodwill.  Assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.

42

Table of Contents
We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. We may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
 As a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2020 no indicators of impairment were identified.
We evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products business segment. As a result, management recorded an impairment charge of $16.2 million, which is included within the Selling, general, and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach (the relief from royalty method). The remaining fair value was not material and was amortized over the asset's remaining useful life. Fair value calculated using this approach is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions.
Income Taxes.  Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. We use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. We cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
We evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. We determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Income Taxes.”

Self-Insurance Liabilities.  We record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers’ compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. We use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. This liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. We review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. The obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. Estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "Other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. Our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $23.3 million and $23.2 million, respectively.
We are also self-insured for employee medical claims. We estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. If actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
Contingencies.  We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. We record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information.
We are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The IRS of the United States routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
Additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Commitments and Contingencies.”
Benefit Plans.  We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. In addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of United States retirees. Benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.

44

Table of Contents
Employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. Future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. We believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. A summary of significant assumptions used to determine the March 31, 2021 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

-------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---------- ------------------------- ----------------------- --------------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------- --- ---- --- ---- - ---- -
 Synergy Health plc Isotron BV Synergy Health Daniken AG Synergy Health Radeberg Synergy Health Allershausen Harwell Dosimeters Ltd U.S. Post-Retirement Benefits Plan

Assumptions used to determine March 31, 2021
Benefit obligations:
Discount rate 2.10 % 0.90 % 0.35 % 1.60 % 0.80 % 2.15 % 2.50 %

Net periodic benefit costs:
Discount rate 2.40 % 1.60 % 0.70 % 1.50 % 1.75 % 2.15 % 3.00 %
Expected return on plan assets 3.50 % 1.60 % 0.70 % n/a n/a n/a n/a

NA – Not applicable.

We develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. Generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2021 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
We develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. Generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $12.6 million at March 31, 2021.
We have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. The assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7.0% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. A 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at March 31, 2021:

---------------------------------------------------- --------------- - -------- --- - -
 100 Basis Point
(dollars in thousands) Increase Decrease
Effect on total service and interest cost components $ — $ —
Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 3 (3)

We recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. This amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). Changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. We measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Benefit Plans,” contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.

Share-Based Compensation.  We measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. We selected the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. This model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
Share-based compensation expense was $26.0 million in fiscal 2021, $23.8 million in fiscal 2020 and $24.0 million in fiscal 2019. Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Share-Based Compensation,” contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IMPACTING THE COMPANY
Recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

INFLATION
Our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. We monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. However, we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws about STERIS, and the acquisition of Cantel. Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date the statement is made and may be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “may,” “will,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects,” “targets,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “impact,” “potential,” “confidence,” “improve,” “optimistic,” “deliver,” “orders,” “backlog,” “comfortable,” “trend”, and “seeks,” or the negative of such terms or other variations on such terms or comparable terminology.

Segment Reporting We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments: *Latin America *AMEA *Europe *North America 124 We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79 ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit.

On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”). Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK.

Divestitures. During fiscal 2021, we sold an Applied Sterilization Technologies laboratory that was located in the Netherlands. We recorded proceeds of $0.5 million, net of cash divested, $6.0 million.
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020. The pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the some of our operations, which may impact our financial position and cash flows. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our Customers. During fiscal 2021, in response to the to the pandemic, we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees, preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility.We allowed employees to work remotely when possible as planned. We do not believe that these actions will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations.
Highlights.  Revenues increased $76.6 million, or 2.5%, to $3,107.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $3,030.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase reflects organic growth in the Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences segments and favorable fluctuations in currencies, which were partially offset by a decline in the Healthcare segment. Growth in the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment in the Healthcare segment was primarily due to reduced demand for our products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced capital spending by Customers in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Healthcare decline was partially offset by the impact of our recent acquisitions and the recognition of $14.6 million of capital equipment revenues that were previously deferred, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (for more information regarding this change refer to Note 1 of the consolidated statements, titled "]:

Option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduces our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2020, we had access to 119,283 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments.

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 23.3% as compared to 18.2% for fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 effective tax rate increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increased percentage of profits earned and taxed in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from analyt...

Healthcare revenues decreased 1.6% in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, reflecting declines in capital equipment and service revenues of 4.7% and 3.2%, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in consumable revenues of 5.0%. The declines in capital equipment and services revenues were primarily due to reduced demand for our products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced capital spending by Customers in response to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluctuations in currencies and the impact from our recent acquisitions were favorable during fiscal 2021. Consumable revenues increased during fiscal 2021, as procedure volumes continued to rebound during the second half of fiscal 2021. At March 31, 2021, the Healthcare segment’s backlog amounted to $206.3 million, increasing 21.3%, as compared to the backlog of $170.1 million at March 31, 2020. Fiscal 2021 backlog was impacted by the recognition of capital equipment revenues that were previously deferred, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (for more information regarding this change refer to Note 1 of the consolidated statements, titled "]:

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Estimates and Assumptions.  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We make certain estimates and and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. We periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition.  Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and and value-added taxes collected from Customers.
We have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We 
 is provided to the Customer. We allocate

41

Table of Contents
the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
Payment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
We do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
Certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At March 31, 2021 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable.  We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
Allowance for Sales Returns.  We maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. We estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience.
Inventories and Reserves. Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost method. Inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead.
We review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
Asset Impairment Losses.  Property, plant, equipment, lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. We conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income during that period.
When historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
Asset and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review “Property, Plant and Equipment.”
Restructuring.  We record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. These accruals include estimates principally related to  on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period the change is identified.
Purchase Accounting and Goodwill.  Assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. We supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities of indefinite lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.

Table of Contents
We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. We may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain at the reporting unit level. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Management']:

['s remaining useful life. Fair value calculated using this approach is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions.
Income Taxes.  Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. We use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. We cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
We evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. We determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Income Taxes.”

Self-Insurance Liabilities.  We record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers’ compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. We use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. This liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. We review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. The obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation.

[" line of our consolidated balance sheets. Our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $23.3 million and $23.2 million, respectively.
We are also self-insured for employee medical claims. We estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. Our self-insured liabilities contain actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
Contingencies.  We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel.

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources.
