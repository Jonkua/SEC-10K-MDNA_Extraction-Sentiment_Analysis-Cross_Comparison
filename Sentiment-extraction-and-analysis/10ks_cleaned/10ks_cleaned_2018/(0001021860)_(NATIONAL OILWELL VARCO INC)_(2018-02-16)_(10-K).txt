ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General
Overview
The Company is a leading independent provider of equipment and technology to the upstream oil and gas industry. With operations in
approximately 611 locations across six continents, NOV designs, manufactures and services a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment; sells and rents drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; performs
inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provides drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; and provides expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with the Company’s large installed base
of equipment. NOV also manufactures coiled tubing and high-pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sells and rents advanced in-line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. The
Company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations.

NOV’s revenue and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability
and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Item 1A. “Risk
Factors”. The Company conducts its operations through three business segments: Wellbore Technologies, Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies. See Item 1. “Business”, for a discussion of each of these
business segments.
Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“GAAP”). Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements in order for them to conform with the 2017 presentation. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding
Depreciation, Amortization and Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. See
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in Results of Operations for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their
corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Operating Environment Overview

NOV’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

National Oilwell Varco, Inc. generated revenue of $7.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 1% from the prior year as improving oil and gas prices resulted in
increased drilling activity and demand for certain oilfield equipment and services. Average 2017 worldwide rig count (as measured by Baker Hughes) increased 27% in comparison to 2016. The increase in activity led to increased revenues in the
Company’s Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions segments, partially offset by declines in Rig Technologies’ revenues.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported an operating loss of $277 million compared to an operating loss of $2,411 million in
2016, and a net loss attributable to the Company of $237 million, or $0.63 per share compared to a net loss of $2,412 million or $6.41 per share during 2016.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $1.97 billion, a $134 million or 7% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017.
The Company reported a net loss of $14 million, or $0.04 per fully diluted share, an increase of $12 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, from the third quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, revenue increased
$277 million or 16%, and net loss decreased $700 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, third quarter of 2017, and fourth quarter of 2016,
pre-tax other items (severance, facility closures, asset impairments, write-downs, and other) were $133 million, nil, and $694 million, respectively. Excluding the other items from all periods,
fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $197 million, compared to $167 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Segment Performance
Wellbore Technologies

Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $715 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of three percent from the third quarter and an
increase of 35 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Demand for the segment’s products, technologies and services continues to drive growth that outpaced global activity levels during the fourth quarter. Operating loss was
$21 million, or 2.9 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $107 million, or 15.0 percent of sales, an increase of 14 percent sequentially and an increase of $87 million from the prior year. Higher volumes and improved
pricing resulted in 59 percent sequential Adjusted EBITDA incrementals (the change in Adjusted EBITDA divided by the change in revenue).

Completion & Production Solutions

Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $690 million, an increase of one percent from the third quarter and an increase of
15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from growing deliveries of pressure pumping equipment and composite pipe, more than offset lower revenues from offshore products. Operating profit was $19 million or 2.8 percent of
sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, or 10.7 percent of sales, a decrease of 24 percent sequentially and an increase of seven percent from the prior year. Higher costs and lower throughput in offshore products and processing
equipment adversely impacted EBITDA margins.
Backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at December 31,
2017 was $1.07 billion. New orders during the quarter were $501 million, representing a book-to-bill of 125 percent when compared to the $401 million
of orders shipped from backlog. The majority of the segment’s business units secured orders in excess of 100 percent book-to-bill. The order book included
topside equipment for an FPSO and strong bookings for coiled tubing equipment.
Rig Technologies

Rig Technologies generated revenues of $614 million, an increase of 20 percent from the third quarter and an increase of $1 million from the
fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues improved from shipments to customers that deferred deliveries from the third quarter, increased order intake, and a seasonal improvement in service and repair work. Operating loss was $51 million, or
8.3 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, or 11.4 percent of sales, an increase of 75 percent sequentially and a decrease of one percent from the prior year. Higher volumes drove the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.

Backlog for capital equipment orders for Technologies at December 31, 2017 was $1.89 billion. New orders during the quarter were
$169 million.

Oil & Gas Equipment and Services Market

Over the past decade, technological advancements in the oilfield equipment and service space unlocked production from formations that were previously deemed
uneconomic, especially in North America. From 2004 to 2014 global oil and liquids supply increased
dramatically from U.S. unconventional resources,
deep-water (defined as water depths greater than 400 feet) resources and from other sources. The advances in technology combined with relatively high commodity prices caused by growing demand enabled and sustained an increase in global drilling
activity. Global supply started to catch up to demand, and, in the latter half of 2014, demand growth in areas such as Asia, Europe and the U.S. weakened while drilling activity remained strong and production continued to grow. As a result, global
inventories of crude and refined products grew and the price of oil declined significantly during early 2015, remaining depressed throughout the year and undergoing another major reduction toward the end of 2015. In early 2016, the market witnessed
oil trading in the high $20 per barrel range, prices not seen since 2003.
In response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions, operators acutely
reduced both operating and capital expenditures. Orders for NOV’s equipment and services slowed and rig counts declined rapidly with active U.S. drilling rig counts hitting 70 year lows, and international rig counts reaching decade lows, during
the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the sharp cutback in activity, production declined in certain areas of the world, global inventories began to decline and commodity prices started to rebound as oil markets began to re-balance. The market downturn began to stabilize during the second half of 2016 and showed early signs of improvement as the year ended. During 2017, land drilling in North America continued to increase, while
international markets stabilized and offshore activity remained depressed. The price of West Texas Intermediate Cushing Crude ended the year at $60.46 a barrel.

Outlook
Activity in North America increased sharply off
historical lows during the last two quarters of 2016 and through 2017. Declines in supply appear to have rebalanced the market; however, commodity prices and global activity levels remain relatively low and challenging conditions persist offshore.
Consequently, the Company anticipates that its customers will continue to moderate capital expenditures to the extent they remain uncertain of a sustainable recovery in commodity prices.

While North America land drilling has increased, activity levels remain well below prior cyclical highs. International activity, which has been slower to fall
than North American activity, may have reached the bottom of its cycle during 2017, though strong signs of recovery are not yet apparent. Offshore activity, which has longer project cycle times and, in certain instances, more challenged economics,
may continue to decline into 2018.
Low activity levels result in an oversupply of service capacity and capital equipment, creating challenging prospects
for many of NOV’s customers and reducing demand for the Company’s products. In this environment, contractors have been hesitant to invest in their existing equipment to conserve as much capital as possible. Equipment has been neglected and
idle fleets have been stripped of parts to sustain assets that remains active. Additionally, certain equipment becomes less desirable and obsolete as equipment manufacturers develop new technologies and produce more efficient equipment that improves
efficiencies and lowers the marginal cost of supply for oil and gas operating companies. The Company believes that the sharp spending reductions its customers have had in place for an extended period have created pent up demand for NOV’s
products that began to show in certain areas during the second half of 2017 as industry activity levels began to improve.
NOV’s global customer base
includes national oil companies, international oil companies, independent oil and gas companies, onshore and offshore service companies and others whose strategies and reactions to low commodity prices vary. Likewise, the Company expects the timing
and slope of revenue stabilization and recovery will be different across its operating regions and its three business segments. NOV’s Wellbore Technologies segment and certain elements of its Completion & Production Solutions and Rig
Technologies segments are realizing a faster recovery as drilling of new wells increases, while a strong recovery for the more capital equipment oriented businesses are expected to come later in the cycle.

NOV will continue to adjust the size of its operations to fit anticipated levels of activity while investing in developing and acquiring new products,
technologies and operations that advance the Company’s longer term strategic goals. NOV has a history of implementing cost-control measures and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions as well as cost effectively ramping operations
to capitalize on rapidly increasing demand. The Company has closed, or is in the process of closing, 385 locations over the past three years. It has reduced its annual expenses relating to salaries, wages, outside services, contractors, travel and
entertainment by approximately $3.0 billion. The Company remains optimistic regarding longer-term market fundamentals as existing oil and gas fields continue to deplete and numerous major projects to replenish supply have been deferred or
canceled while global demand continues to grow.
Though the Company benefited from a high concentration of orders for offshore drilling equipment and
services in the preceding years, significant contraction in the offshore market during the recent downturn adversely effected the Company’s performance. Offshore market dynamics and equipment oversupply are expected to cause slower recovery
there than in our land business, however, it is in NOV’s strategic interest to maintain a leading position in offshore drilling equipment. The Company has intentionally and successfully pivoted towards onshore and non-drilling related
activities in recent years, highly responsive to the industry’s increased focus on onshore unconventional developments. Approximately 65% of consolidated revenues were derived from onshore businesses in 2017, compared to approximately 40% in
2014.
NOV expects unconventional shale resources to continue to gain a greater share of global production, and the Company will continue to enhance its
offering into unconventional resource focused products and technologies, including advanced, automated drilling rigs; premium drillpipe and directional drilling technologies; hydraulic fracture stimulation equipment; and multistage completion tools.
NOV expects big data and predictive analytics to improve uptime and operating efficiency, and the Company remains at the forefront of applying this promising technology to oilfield drilling and completion equipment. NOV expects the oil and gas
industry to adopt more efficient supply chain practices that the Company is pioneering to construct floating production facilities to produce the immense resources discovered offshore. The Company has used the recent downturn to vigorously advance
these strategic initiatives, and is encouraged by its progress.

year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to higher drilling activity.
Operating loss from Wellbore Technologies was $102 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $668 million (86.8%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss percentage decreased to 4.0% from 35.0% in 2016. Operating loss decreased due to higher
drilling activity in 2017.
Included in operating profit are other items related to costs associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Plan established by
the Company during the first quarter of 2016, costs related to severance and facility closures, and asset write-downs. Other items included in operating profit for Wellbore Technologies were $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2017
and $476 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Completion & Production Solutions

Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2,672 million, an increase of $431 million
(19.2%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to higher market activity.
Operating profit (loss) from
Completion & Production Solutions was $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $(266) million for 2016, an increase of $364 million (136.8%). Operating profit (loss) percentage increased to 3.7%
from (11.9)% in 2016. This increase was due to an overall increase in market activity.
Included in operating profit are other items related to costs
associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Plan established by the Company during the first quarter of 2016; costs related to severance and facility closures; items related to acquisitions, such as transaction costs, the amortization of backlog
and inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting; and asset write-downs. Other items included in operating profit for Completion & Production Solutions were $33 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 and $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

30

The Completion & Productions Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its
business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was
$1,066 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $248 million, or 30% from backlog of $818 million at December 31, 2016. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these
factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $953 million of revenue out of backlog in 2018 and approximately $113 million of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At December 31, 2017, approximately 59% of the
capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 73% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.
Rig
Technologies
Revenue from Rig Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2,252 million, a decrease of $858 million (27.6%)
compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to lower volumes in all areas.
Operating loss from Rig Technologies was
$14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $1,019 million (98.6%) compared to 2016. Operating loss percentage decreased to 0.6%, from 33.2% in 2016. Operating loss decreased primarily due to a
$972 million impairment charge incurred on the carrying value of goodwill during the third quarter of 2016 that did not repeat in 2017, partially offset by lower volumes.

Included in operating profit are other items related to costs associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Plan established by the Company during the first
quarter of 2016, costs related to severance and facility closures, and asset write-downs, including the impairment charge mentioned above. Other items included in operating profit for Rig Technologies were $129 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and $1,255 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment
backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was
$1.9 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.6 billion, or 24%, from backlog of $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors,
the Company reasonably expects approximately $0.8 billion of revenue out of backlog in 2018 and approximately $1.1 billion of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At December 31, 2017, approximately 78% of the capital
equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 81% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.

Eliminations and corporate costs
Eliminations and
corporate costs in operating loss were $259 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $342 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change is primarily due to lower intersegment sales. Sales from one
segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the Company. Eliminations and corporate costs include intercompany
transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation, as well as corporate costs not allocated to the segments. Intercompany transactions within each reporting segment are eliminated within each reporting
segment.
Other income (expense), net
Other income
(expense), net were expenses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to expenses of $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower asset disposals.

Provision for income taxes
The effective tax rate for
the year ended December 31, 2017 was 39.8%, compared to 7.9% for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. related to 2017 U.S. tax law changes, partially offset by valuation
allowances established on foreign tax credits generated during the year, when applied to losses resulted in a higher effective tax rate than the U.S. statutory rate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impairment of goodwill not
deductible for tax purposes, lower tax rates on losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions, and the establishment of valuation allowances, when applied to losses resulted in a lower effective tax rate than the U.S. statutory rate.

quarters of 2016 and 2015, costs related to severance and facility closures, and asset write-downs, including the impairment charge mentioned above. Other items included in operating profit for Wellbore Technologies were $476 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016 and $1,775 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Completion & Production Solutions

Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2,241 million, a decrease of
$1,124 million (33.4%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower market activity.
Operating profit
(loss) from Completion & Production Solutions was $(266) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $187 million for 2015, a decrease of $453 million (242.2%). Operating profit (loss) percentage decreased
to (11.9)% from 5.6% in 2015. This decrease was due to the overall decline in market activity.
Included in operating profit are other items related to
costs associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Plan established by the Company during the first quarters of 2016 and 2015; costs related to severance and facility closures; items related to acquisitions, such as transaction costs, the
amortization of backlog and inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting; and asset write-downs. Other items included in operating profit for Completion & Production Solutions were $274 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 and $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

32

The Completion & Productions Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its
business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $818 million
at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $151 million, or 16% from backlog of $969 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, approximately 71% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and
approximately 87% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.
Rig Technologies

Revenue from Rig Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,110 million, a decrease of $5,169 million (62.4%) compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower land rig shipments, delayed delivery dates of certain offshore projects and lower global drilling activity which caused customers to use existing inventories and components from idle
and unused rigs to repair better utilized rigs rather than purchase new.
Operating loss from Rig Technologies was $1,033 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2,534 million (168.8%) compared to 2015. Operating profit (loss) percentage decreased to (33.2)%, from 18.1% in 2015. Operating profit percentage decreased primarily due to lower volumes, pricing
pressure and a $972 million impairment charge incurred on the carrying value of goodwill during the third quarter of 2016.
Included in operating
profit are other items related to costs associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Plan established by the Company during the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, costs related to severance and facility closures, and asset write-downs, including the
impairment charge mentioned above. Other items included in operating profit for Rig Technologies were $1,255 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a
firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. In light of the vote by the shareholders of SETE Brasil Participacoes SA to authorize Sete to file for bankruptcy, and a further decline in
drilling activity during the first half of 2016 to record lows and the resulting effect on certain other customers, the Company removed $2.1 billion of orders from its backlog in the first quarter of 2016. Some of the contracts for these orders
remain in place and are enforceable. If these customers obtain funding to continue their projects, the Company may pursue resumption of construction and update the backlog accordingly. The capital equipment backlog was $2.5 billion at
December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.6 billion, or 59%, from backlog of $6.1 billion at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and
approximately 82% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.
Eliminations and corporate costs

Eliminations and corporate costs in operating loss were $342 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $505 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015. This change is primarily due to lower intersegment sales. Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are
credited with the full profit to the Company. Eliminations and corporate costs include intercompany transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation, as well as corporate costs not allocated to the
segments. Intercompany transactions within each reporting segment are eliminated within each reporting segment.
Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net were expenses of $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to expenses of $123 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses.
Provision for income taxes

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 7.9%, compared to (30.2)% for 2015. Impairment of goodwill not deductible for tax
purposes, lower tax rates on losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions, and an increase in valuation allowance on deferred taxes, which, when applied to losses generated during the period, resulted in a lower effective tax rate than the U.S.
statutory rate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations

The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and Other Items) in its periodic earnings press
releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the business. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace
GAAP financial measures, such as Net Income. Other items in 2017 consisted primarily of restructure charges for inventory write-downs, facility closures and severance payments. Other items in 2016 consisted primarily of goodwill impairment expense
and restructure charges for inventory write-downs, facility closures and severance payments. Other items in 2015 consisted primarily of goodwill and intangible asset impairment expenses and restructure charges for inventory write-downs, facility
closures and severance payments.
The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP financial measure (in

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong
financial position, with resources available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short- and long-term objectives. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of
operations and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements including capital expenditures, debt and interest payments and dividend
payments for the foreseeable future.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,437 million, and total debt of
$2,712 million. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $1,408 million and total debt was $3,214 million. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $978 million of the $1,437 million of cash and
cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash were subject to U.S. taxation under the Act defined in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are
greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility or utilize its commercial paper program.

On June 27, 2017, the Company entered into a new $3.0 billion credit agreement evidencing a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which
expires on June 27, 2022, with a syndicate of financial institutions. This new credit facility replaced the Company’s previous $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments
under this new agreement to an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion upon the consent of only those lenders holding any such increase. Interest under the new multicurrency facility is based upon LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR plus 1.125% subject to a
ratings-based grid or the U.S. prime rate. The new credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60%. As of
December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 16.1%.

On November 29, 2017, the Company repaid in its entirety the $500 million of its 1.35% unsecured Senior Notes using available cash balances.

The Company’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2017 was $2,712 million and consisted of $1,392 million in 2.60% Senior Notes,
$1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, no commercial paper borrowings, and other debt of $232 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, there were no commercial paper borrowings supported by the $3.0 billion credit facility and no outstanding letters of credit
issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this revolving credit facility.
The Company had
$658 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2017 that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds. The following table
summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):

----------------------------------------- ------------------------ ---- - ---- - ------ ---- - ------ -
 Years Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 832 $ 960 $ 1,332
Net cash used in investing activities (245 ) (488 ) (514 )
Net cash used in financing activities (595 ) (1,141 ) (2,163 )

Operating Activities

2017 vs 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $832 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of
$960 million in 2016. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations in 2017 primarily from operating activities that generated earnings before
non-cash charges of $379 million and $5 million in equity loss in unconsolidated affiliates.
Net
changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, provided $448 million of cash in 2017 compared to $1,044 million provided in 2016. The decrease in cash provided in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to declines in
cash provided by accounts receivable, inventory and costs in excess of billings, partially offset by declines in cash used by accrued liabilities and billings in excess of costs and by accounts payable providing cash in 2017 compared to using cash
in 2016.

35

2016 vs 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities was $960 million in 2016 compared to net cash
provided by operating activities of $1,332 million in 2015. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was used by operations

primarily through net loss of $2,416 million plus non-cash charges of $2,305 million, $6 million in a
dividend received from Voest-Alpine Tubulars, an unconsolidated affiliate, and $21 million in equity loss in unconsolidated affiliates.
Net changes
in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, provided $1,044 million of cash in 2016 compared to $466 million used in 2015. The decrease in cash used in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to declines in
accounts receivable, inventory and costs in excess of billings, partially offset by declines in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and billings in excess of costs.

Investing Activities
2017 vs 2016. Net
cash used in investing activities was $245 million in 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $488 million in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of decreased acquisitions
and capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016. The Company used $86 million during 2017 for acquisitions compared to $230 million in 2016 and $192 million for capital expenditures during 2017, compared to $284 million in
2016.
2016 vs 2015. Net cash used in investing activities was $488 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$514 million in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015, offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions. The Company used
$284 million during 2016 for capital expenditures compared to $453 million in 2015 and $230 million for acquisitions during 2016, compared to $86 million in 2015.

Financing Activities
2017 vs 2016. Net
cash used in financing activities was $595 million in 2017 compared to $1,141 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of $506 million of debt payments in 2017 compared to $900 million used to make payments on net
commercial paper borrowings in 2016. In addition, the Company decreased its dividend to $76 million during 2017 compared to $230 million in 2016.

2016 vs 2015. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,141 million in 2016 compared to $2,163 million in 2015. This decrease was
primarily the result of $900 million used to make payments on net commercial paper borrowings in 2016 compared to $762 million of net commercial paper borrowings in 2015 used to purchase $2,221 million (44.0 million shares) of
the Company’s outstanding common shares. In addition, the Company decreased its dividend to $230 million during 2016 compared to $710 million in 2015.

Other
The effect of the change in exchange rates
on cash was an increase (decrease) of $37 million, $(3) million and $(111) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be
sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations.
We intend to pursue
additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from
operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional
financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $132 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits
associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the
timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits
have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates
and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long-term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets); impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; service and product warranties and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience
and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.
Revenue Recognition under Long-term Construction Contracts

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for
certain long-term construction contracts in the Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments. These long-term construction contracts include the following characteristics:

 • the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications;

 • the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and

 • construction projects often have progress payments.

This method requires the Company to make estimates
regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares
detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least
quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in
“Risk Factors.” These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Company’s estimates and materially impact the Company’s future reported earnings.

Historically, the Company’s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage-of-completion contracts. For both years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the difference between the prior year estimated margin on open percentage-of-completion contracts and actual results was less than 1% of the total revenue on open contracts. While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding
contracts at and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage-of-completion accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph
could result in significant adjustments in future periods.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends.
Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Company’s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough
review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Company’s customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific
customers. A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue comes from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government-owned or government-controlled oil companies. Therefore, the
Company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Company’s customers could also
deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, allowance for bad debts totaled $187 million and $209 million, or 8.5% and 9.1% of gross accounts
receivable, respectively.
Historically, the Company’s charge-offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in estimates could become material in future periods.

38

Inventory Reserves

Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of
inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are limited. The Company’s inventory consists of finished goods, spare
parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Company’s large installed base of highly specialized oilfield equipment. The Company’s estimated carrying value of inventory depends upon demand
largely driven by levels of oil and gas well drilling and remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Company’s customers, political
stability and governmental regulation in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors.

The Company evaluates inventory quarterly using the best information available at the time to inform our assumptions and estimates about future demand and
resulting sales volumes, and recognizes reserves as necessary to properly state inventory. The historically severe oil-industry downturn that started in mid-2014 began
to stabilize during the second half of 2016, and showed early signs of improvement in many areas in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, before declining slightly in the second quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw
improvement in oil prices. These signs of improvement, including conversations with customers about their plans, as well as inquiries and orders for products, provided the Company information with which to assess and adjust assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. We saw clear evidence that a market recovery will favor newer technology and the most efficient equipment, and that certain products across our portfolio, for both land and offshore environments, were less likely to be
successful going forward as our customers find footing in their newly competitive landscape.
Based on an update of our assumptions at each point in time
related to estimates of future demand, during 2017 and 2016 we recorded charges for additions to inventory reserves of $114 million and $606 million, respectively, consisting primarily of obsolete and surplus inventories. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, inventory reserves totaled $800 million and $1,017 million, or 21.0% and 23.4% of gross inventory, respectively.

Throughout the downturn the Company has continued to invest in developing and advancing products and technologies, contributing to the obsolescence of certain
older products in a dramatically-shifted and more highly competitive recovering market, but also ensuring that the portfolio of products and services offered by the Company will meet customer needs in 2018 and beyond.

We will continue to assess our inventory levels and inventory offerings for our customers, which could require the Company to record additional allowances to
reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates or assumptions could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets)

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Company’s total
assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives.

The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using
an income approach. This requires the Company to make long-term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Company’s products and services, future
market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Company’s customers, political stability
in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast.
Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts’ forecasts, collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant deterioration of external financing for
our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company has approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill and $0.4 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31,
2017. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or
other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant sustained reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a
significant sustained reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a sustained reduction in the market capitalization of the Company; a significant sustained reduction in capital investment by drilling
companies and oil and gas
companies; or a significant sustained increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas.

39

The discounted cash flow is based on management’s forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit.
The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash flow from operations from each of the Company’s individual
reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting unit’s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were
estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts
our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long-term
trend.
While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and
representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management’s expectations, where possible. The valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous
testing. The inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts.
During the review of its 2015 annual goodwill
impairment test, the calculated fair values for all of the Company’s reporting units were in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value, with two exceptions. The Drilling & Intervention and Drill Pipe reporting units
within the Company’s Wellbore Technologies segment, had calculated fair values below carrying value, resulting in a $1,485 million write-down in goodwill. Additionally, based on the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset
impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2015, the fair value for all of the Company’s intangible assets with indefinite lives were in excess of the respective asset carrying values, with one exception. This intangible asset,
which represents a trade name within the Company’s Wellbore Technologies segment, had a calculated fair value approximately $149 million below its carrying value. Impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily the result
of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through the fourth quarter of 2015, declines in forecasts in rig activity, and a decline in the revenue forecast for the Company for 2016.

During the third quarter of 2016, market factors indicated a more prolonged downturn associated with newbuild offshore drilling rigs, and we reduced our
forecast accordingly, which indicated a goodwill impairment in the Rig Offshore reporting unit was possible. Based on the Company’s step one interim goodwill impairment analysis as of July 1, 2016, the Rig Offshore reporting unit had a
calculated fair value below its carrying value, and required a step two analysis, which compares the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit to the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is
determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Consistent with the step one analysis, fair value of the assets and liabilities was
determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820. Based on the step two analysis performed for the Rig Offshore reporting unit, the Company recorded a $972 million write-down of goodwill during the third quarter of 2016.

On July 1, 2017, the Company’s Wellbore Technologies segment reorganized three of its reporting units, moving various operations between them. The
goodwill impairment analyses performed prior to and subsequent to the restructuring of the three reporting units, concluded that the calculated fair values of these reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying value. The
restructuring had no effect on Wellbore Technologies consolidated financial position and results of operations.

The Company combined its Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket reporting units into two different reporting units, Rig Equipment and Marine Construction, under a
segment called Rig Technologies, effective October 1, 2017. The restructuring better aligns operations with the current and anticipated market environments, reduces administrative burden, and eliminates reported intercompany transactions
between Rig Technologies’ capital equipment and aftermarket operations. The Company tested the Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket reporting units for impairment prior to combining, and the two, new reporting units under the Rig Technologies
segment for impairment after combining, and concluded all fair values of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.

40

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test, as described in ASC Topic
350, as of October 1, 2017. Based on the Company’s annual impairment test, the calculated fair values for all of the Company’s reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value.
Additionally, the fair value for all of the Company’s intangible assets with indefinite lives were substantially in excess of the respective asset carrying values.

Purchase Price Allocation of Acquisitions
The Company
allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as
goodwill. The Company uses all available information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets, and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. The Company engages
third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned
to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, could materially impact the Company’s results of operations.

Service and Product Warranties
The Company provides
service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic
450 “Contingencies” (“ASC Topic 450”). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product
performance issues and recognizes them when they are incurred. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, service and product warranty accruals totaled $135 million and $172 million, respectively.

Income Taxes
The Company is U.S. registered and is
subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been recorded based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and
income is earned. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted significant changes to the U.S. tax law that affect many aspects of corporate tax. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect on the Company’s 2017 tax
provision.
The Company’s annual tax provision is based on taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various
jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant
judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange
restrictions or the Company’s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions
between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries.

The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax
provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be
deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may
result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). However, actual results may
differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the
event.
The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax
assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Company’s valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable
income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance
would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.
The Company has not provided for
deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes.
Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $5,302 million at December 31, 2017. The Company makes a determination each period whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company
distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liabilities would result.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-11 “Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory” (ASU 2015-11). This update requires inventory measured using the first in, first out (FIFO) or average cost methods to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2017 with no material impact.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-09 “Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting” (ASU 2016-09). This update simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, and the classification on
the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on
January 1, 2017. The cumulative impact of the adoption of this standard was $1 million to retained earnings, and the classification on the statement of cash flows was applied on a prospective basis.

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-16 “Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets
Other Than Inventory” (ASU 2016-16). This update requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. The Company has early adopted this update on January 1, 2017 and
recorded a $5 million reduction to retained earnings and receivables. The effect of the change on net income is not significant.
In January 2017,
the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (ASU 2017-04). This update eliminates the
requirement to compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company has early adopted this update on July 1, 2017 with no material impact.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2017, the
FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU
2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective
for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07 “Improving the Presentation of Net
Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (ASU 2017-07). This update requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs
and separately from other components of net benefit cost. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does
not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position.

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). This update amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 230 “Statement of Cash Flows” and provides guidance and clarification on
presentation of certain cash flow issues. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and
comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
and for interim periods within those fiscal years.

In preparing for the
adoption of this new standard, the Company has established an internal team to centralize the implementation process as well as engaged external resources to assist in our approach. We are currently utilizing a software program to consolidate and
accumulate leases with documentation as required by the new standard. We have assessed the changes to the Company’s current accounting practices and are investigating the related tax impact and process changes. We are also in the
process of quantifying the impact of the new standard on our balance sheet.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific
guidance. This ASU proscribes a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration
it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard permits either a full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is
applied to all the periods presented, or a modified retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied only to the current period with a cumulative-effect adjustment reflected in retained earnings. ASU
2014-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will follow the modified retrospective adoption.

In 2015, the Company assembled an internal team to study the provisions of ASU 2014-09, began assessing the potential
impacts on the Company and educating the organization. In 2016, the Company engaged external resources to complete the assessment of potential changes to current accounting practices related to material revenue streams. Potential impacts were
identified based on required changes to current processes to accommodate provisions in the new standard. We have designed and implemented process, system, control and data requirement changes to address the impacts identified in our assessments.

Based on an analysis of revenue streams, customer contracts and transactions, the Company does not expect a material change in the timing or other
impacts to revenue recognition across most of our businesses. Certain service and repair revenue will change from point-in-time to over-time revenue recognition, and the
timing of including uninstalled materials in projects will shift, changing only the timing of revenue recognition and not the total amount. We expect the cumulative-effect adjustment we will record in the first quarter of 2018, as required by the
modified retrospective method, to be less than $50 million. The final adjustment is subject to concluding on the available practical expediants.
