2017 Operational Highlights

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased 6.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 7.4% compared to the prior year. The increase in sales primarily reflects the impact of consolidating twelve months of Sirona’s sales in 2017 as compared to ten months of sales in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses (a non-US GAAP measure as referenced above), grew 1.6% on a constant currency basis including a benefit of 1.8% from net acquisitions. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior period.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona declined primarily as a result of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,650.9 million and a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $346.7 million. The Company reported a net loss of $6.76 per share compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.94 in the prior year. On an adjusted basis (a non-US GAAP measure as defined under the heading “Net Income attributable to Dentsply Sirona”), full year 2017 net income was similar to prior year and earnings per diluted share declined 4.3% to $2.66 from $2.78 in the prior year. The Company’s results reflect a significant earnings headwind from higher weighted average share count of approximately 4.9%, or $0.13 per diluted share and currency rate changes compared to the prior year of approximately 3.0%, or $0.05 per diluted share. These impacts were partially offset by $0.08 from the consolidation of an additional two months of Sirona earnings in 2017.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2017, the Company deployed cash in excess of $632 million as it returned cash to shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, as well as strengthened the business through acquisitions. During 2017, the Company completed multiple acquisitions, including purchased intangible assets, with an aggregate purchase price of $152.6 million, including the acquisition of Recherche Techniques Dentaires (RTD), the worldwide leader in endodontic posts and Healthdent the market leader in gutta-percha formulations. In addition, the Company repurchased $401.4 million of common shares outstanding in 2017 and paid dividends of $78.3 million.

• In 2017, the Company continued integration activities to capture cost synergies. The Company received the necessary approvals to proceed with its current plans for German reorganization. Additionally, the Company completed the elimination of certain corporate redundancies and continued execution of country and manufacturing consolidation activities.

BUSINESS

The Company operates in two business segments, Technologies & Equipment and Consumables.

The Technologies & Equipment segment is responsible for the worldwide design, manufacture, sales and distribution of the Company’s Dental Technology & Equipment Products and Healthcare Consumable Products. These products includes dental implants, laboratory dental products, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers as well as consumable medical device products.

The Consumables segment includes responsibility for the worldwide design, manufacture, sales and distribution of the Company’s Dental Consumable Products which include preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic, and orthodontic dental products.

Principal Measurements

The principal measurements used by the Company in evaluating its business are: (1) constant currency sales growth by segment and geographic region; (2) internal sales growth by segment and geographic region; and (3) adjusted operating income and margins of each reportable segment, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, corporate expenses, and certain other items to enhance the comparability of results period to period. These principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

The Company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This impact is calculated by comparing current-period revenues to prior-period revenues, with both periods converted at the U.S. dollar to local currency foreign exchange rate for each month of the prior period, for the currencies in which the Company does business. The Company defines “internal” sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of net acquisitions and divestitures, Merger accounting impacts and discontinued products.

Business Drivers

The primary drivers of internal growth include macroeconomic factors, global dental market growth, innovation and new product launches by the Company, as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources, including clinical education. Management believes that the Company’s ability to execute its strategies should allow it to grow faster than the underlying dental market over time. On a short term basis, changes in strategy or distributor inventory levels can impact internal growth.

The Company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis. The Company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency. In addition, management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations and functions, as part of integration activities, to further reduce costs. While the current period results reflect the unfavorable impact of integration related inefficiencies, the Company believes that the future benefits from these global efficiency and integration initiatives will improve the cost structure and help mitigate the impacts of rising costs such as energy, employee benefits and regulatory oversight and compliance. The Company has targeted a cost reduction initiative of approximately $100 million expected to be achieved over the next several years as the benefits of these initiatives, net of related investments, are realized over time. The Company expects that it will record restructuring charges, from time to time, associated with such initiatives. These restructuring charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and there can be no assurance that the target adjusted operating income margins will continue to be achieved.

38

As announced in October 2016, the Company proposed plans in Germany to reorganize and combine portions of its manufacturing, logistics and distribution networks within the Company’s two segments. As required under German law, the Company entered into a statutory co-determination process under which it collaborated with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative. In 2017, the Company received all necessary approvals and is proceeding with its current plans. The Company estimates the cost of these initiatives to be approximately $65 million, primarily for severance related benefits for employees, which is expected to be incurred as actions are implemented over the next two years. The Company recorded costs of approximately $29 million associated with these plans. The Company estimates that the future annual savings related to these plans to be in the range of $12 million and $14 million to be realized over the next one to three years. There is no assurance that future savings will be fully achieved. The Company continues to initiate similar actions in other regions of the world.

Product innovation is a key component of the Company’s overall growth strategy. New advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the Company operates. As a result, the Company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development, including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools. In addition, the Company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties. Although the Company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental, healthcare consumable and dental technology products, they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed.

The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income. Price increases, promotional activities as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation. The Company typically implements most of its price increases in October or January of a given year across most of its businesses. Distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase. Required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels in excess of retail demand. These net inventory changes have impacted the Company’s consolidated net sales and net income in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, over a given period or multiple periods. In addition, the Company may from time to time, engage in new distributor relationships that could cause quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income. Distributor inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from the Company’s predictions, resulting in the Company’s projections of future results being different than expected. There can be no assurance that the Company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history, or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history. Any of these fluctuations could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company had two exclusive distribution agreements with Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”) for the marketing and sales of certain legacy Sirona products and equipment in the United States and Canada. In order to maintain exclusivity, certain purchase targets had to be achieved. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Patterson’s decision not to extend the exclusivity beyond September 2017 was announced. Following that announcement, in May 2017, the Company entered into a new three-year agreement with Patterson whereby Patterson would continue to distribute the Company’s equipment lines in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company also entered into two separate multi-year agreements with Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”) for the distribution of the Company’s equipment lines in the United States and Canada. While the agreement with Henry Schein with respect to the United States was effective September 1, 2017, the agreement relating to Canada was effective June 2017. The Company began shipping initial stocking orders for the equipment products to Henry Schein under the agreements in the second quarter of 2017 and continued through the balance of 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company also modified its distribution agreement with Henry Schein with respect to the distribution of certain products in France. Based on the Company’s estimate, year-over-year changes in distributor inventories associated with these agreements positively impacted the Company’s reported sales for the full year of 2017 by approximately $23 million. Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased during 2017 by approximately $26 million as compared to an increase of approximately $3 million during 2016. The increase in inventory levels was the result of the combination of lower equipment sales to end-users as well as higher than anticipated inventory levels held by distributors. The Company’s anticipated decrease in inventory levels held by distributors is projected to negatively impact the Company’s sales by approximately $40 million during 2018.

The Company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the Company’s product offerings, technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions. Although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the Company operates have experienced consolidation, they remain fragmented. Management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future.

39

Impact of Foreign Currencies and Interest Rates

Due to the Company’s significant international presence, movements in foreign exchange and interest rates may impact the Consolidated Statements of Operations. With approximately two thirds of the Company’s net sales located in regions outside the United States, the Company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange and interest rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Reclassification of Prior Year Amounts

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years’ data in order to conform to current year presentation. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company realigned reporting responsibilities for multiple businesses, as a result of a retirement of one of the Company’s then Chief Operating Officers, into three operating segments. Furthermore, as a result of changes in the senior management level during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company realigned reporting responsibilities into two operating segments. The segment information reflects the revised fourth quarter organizational structure for all periods shown.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2017 Compared to 2016

Net Sales

The discussion below summarizes the Company’s sales growth which excludes precious metal content, into the following components: (1) impact of the Merger; and (2) the results of the “Combined Businesses” as if the businesses were merged on January 1, 2016. These disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods.

Management believes that the presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, provides useful information to investors because a portion of Dentsply Sirona’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the Company’s precious metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the Company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, Dentsply Sirona reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. The Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change.

The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and is therefore considered a non-US GAAP measure.  The Company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content.  The Company’s definitions and calculations of net sales, excluding precious metal content, and other operating measures derived using net sales, excluding precious metal content, may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content $ 3,952.9 $ 3,681.0 $ 271.9 7.4 %

40

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3,952.9 million, an increase of $271.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, reflects sales of $112.7 million as a result of the consolidation of two additional months of Sirona for the year end December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period. This excludes approximately $4.0 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $23 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors in North America and Europe, that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, inventory held by these distributors increased by approximately $26 million during the current year compared to an increase of approximately $3 million in 2016. The inventory increase in 2017 was more than anticipated, in the Company’s assessment, as a result of lower equipment sales to end-users as well as higher than anticipated stocking of inventory by distributors in the U.S. The Company expects net sales during 2018 to be negatively impacted by approximately $40 million as a result of a planned reduction of inventory held at distributors.

Sales related to precious metal content declined 37.0% during 2017, which was primarily due to the continued reduction in the use of precious metal alloys in dentistry.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 1.6% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.8% from net acquisitions, which leads to negative internal sales growth of 20 basis points. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was benefited by approximately 60 basis points as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. A reconciliation of reported net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content, of the combined business for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectfully, is as follows:

United States

Reported net sales increased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $42 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at two distributors in the United States related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). This excludes approximately $4.0 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses declined 0.5% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.1% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 10 basis points, which results in a negative internal sales growth rate of 1.5%. The negative internal sales growth in this region was driven by lower demand in the Technologies & Equipment segment. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was benefited by approximately 3% as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

42

Europe

Reported net sales increased by 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was unfavorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $9 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at a certain distributor in Europe that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail).

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 2.3% from net acquisitions, which results in internal sales growth of 1.8%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 2.2% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Internal sales growth in this region was primarily driven by higher demand in both segments. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Rest of World

Reported net sales increased by 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was unfavorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $10 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at a certain distributor in Canada that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail).

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 0.8% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 2.2% from net acquisitions, which results in negative internal sales growth of 1.4%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 0.9% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. The negative internal sales growth in this region was driven by lower demand in the Technologies & Equipment segment. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1% as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

SG&A Expenses

SG&A expenses, including research and development expenses, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 100 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher rate was primarily driven by increased professional service costs, biennial trade show and other selling events, unfavorable foreign currency and increased amortization and depreciation which unfavorably impacted the rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the rate was also unfavorably impact by 80 basis points due to employment agreement costs related to the resignation of senior management compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in business combination related costs which favorably impacted the rate by 120 basis points as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Goodwill impairment

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,650.9 million. The charge is related to three reporting units in the Technologies & Equipment segment. For further information see Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Restructuring and Other Costs

The Company recorded net restructuring and other costs of $425.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Company recorded net restructuring expense of $55.4 million related to restructuring initiatives in Germany and organizational management changes announced during the fourth quarter. As announced in October 2016, the Company proposed plans in Germany to reorganize and combine portions of its manufacturing, logistics and distribution networks within the Company’s two segments. As required under German law, the Company entered into a statutory co-determination process under which it collaborated with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative. In 2017, the Company received all necessary approvals and is proceeding with its current plans. The Company estimates the cost of these initiatives to be approximately $65 million, primarily for severance related benefits for employees, which is expected to be incurred as actions are implemented over the next two years. The Company recorded costs of approximately $29 million associated with these plans. The Company estimates that the future annual savings related to these plans to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million to be realized over the next one to three years. There is no assurance that future savings will be fully achieved.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded other costs of $369.8 million which consist of impairment charges of $346.7 million and legal settlements of $23.1 million. For further information on the impairment charges, see Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income taxes were a net benefit of $53.2 million. During the year, the Company recorded the following discrete tax items, $20.5 million of excess tax benefit related to employee share based compensation, tax expense of $12.0 million related primarily to state valuation allowances, $ 3.6 million related to enacted statutory rate changes, $1.0 million related to other discrete tax matters and $20.1 million related to US Tax Reform. The Company also recorded a $ 99.1 million tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment charge recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding these discrete tax items and adjusting pretax loss to exclude the pretax loss related to the impairment of the intangible assets and non-deductible goodwill impairment charge the Company’s effective tax rate was 7.54%. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the Company’s change in the mix of consolidated earnings. Further information regarding the details of income taxes is presented in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act" or "U.S. tax reform") was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% in 2018 from 35%, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for enactment effects of SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the Act’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under Accounting Standards Codification No. 740 “Income Taxes”, (“ASC 740”). In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Act. The Company’s accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but the Company has determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a net provisional income tax charge of $20.1 million, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the consolidated statement of income.

Based on information available, the Company estimated the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings to be approximately $1.1 billion and recorded a provisional estimate of $62.2 million of income tax expense related to the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. There is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act, in particular as it relates to state income taxes. Further, the Company has not yet completed the analysis of the components of the computation, including the amount of the foreign earnings subject to U.S. income tax, and the portion of the foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. As of December 31, 2017, primarily due to the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain other tax attributes the estimated cash liability for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $1.0 million. However, as the Company completes its analysis an additional liability could be recorded and the Company would elect to make installment payments as allowed under the Act.

As a result of the Act, the Company can repatriate the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. The Company is still evaluating whether to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under SAB 118.

The remaining provisional amount is a benefit of $42.1 million relating to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities. For the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Act, a provisional estimate could not be made as the Company has not yet completed its assessment or elected an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or to record GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.

In accordance with SEC guidance, provisional amounts may be refined as a result of additional guidance from, and interpretations by, U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, and changes in assumptions. In the subsequent period, provisional amounts will be adjusted for the effects, if any, of interpretative guidance issued after January 19, 2018, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act may be subject to changes for items that were previously reported as provisional amounts, as well as any element of the 2017 Tax Act that a provisional estimate could not be made, and such changes could be material.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2017 included the net impact of restructuring program related costs and other costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $2,374.8 billion and $183.6 million, respectively.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2016 included the net impact of business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring program related costs and other costs, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $340.3 million and $153.1 million, respectively.

Net (Loss) Income attributable to Dentsply Sirona

In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net (loss) income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”). The Company discloses adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.

46

Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics.

The adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:

(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statement of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.
(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract terminations costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as, legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company’s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.
(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.
(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.
(5) Certain fair value adjustments related to an unconsolidated affiliated company. This adjustment represents the fair value adjustment of the unconsolidated affiliated company’s convertible debt instrument held by the Company. The affiliate is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The fair value adjustment is driven by open market pricing of the affiliate’s equity instruments, which has a high degree of variability and may not be indicative of the operating performance of the affiliate or the Company.
(6) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.
Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. The non-US GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Adjusted Operating Income and Margin

Adjusted operating income and margin is another important internal measure for the Company. Operating income in accordance with US GAAP is adjusted for the items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income, a non-US GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales, excluding precious metal content.

Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income. The performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with the adjusted non-US GAAP earnings noted above as well as other performance metrics. This non-US GAAP measure may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Technologies & Equipment

Reported net sales increased by 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by $173.9 million or 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects sales of $98.6 million as a result of the inclusion of two additional months of Sirona for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $23 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors in North America and Europe, that the Company believes is related to million as a result of a planned reduction of inventory held at distributors.

50

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses declined 0.1% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of approximately 2.7% from net acquisitions, which results in negative internal sales growth of 2.8%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to the prior year. Sales decline was led by the U.S. and the Rest of World regions, partially offset by Europe. The negative internal sales growth rate, based on the Company’s estimate, was favorably impacted by changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors related to the transition in distribution strategy.

The operating income increased $55.3 million or 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 reflects the impact of the consolidation of two additional months of Sirona, and the savings from the Company’s global efficiency and integration program. Based on the Company’s assessment, operating income was favorably impacted by the change in net equipment inventory as discussed above.

Consumables

Reported net sales increased by 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by $98.0 million or 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects sales of $14.1 million as a result of the inclusion of two additional months of Sirona for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 3.7% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 0.6% from net acquisitions which results in internal growth of 3.1%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 1.2% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Sales growth in this segment reflects increased demand in the all regions.

The operating income increased $41.8 million or 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in sales, favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3,681.0 million, an increase of $1,099.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, as reported by legacy DENTSPLY. This excludes approximately $13.5 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income.

Sales related to precious metal content declined 30.7% during 2016, which was primarily related to the discontinued refinery product lines and to a lesser extent the continued reduction in the use of precious metal alloys in dentistry.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our combined businesses grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.7% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 50 basis points, which leads to internal growth of 2.4%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period.

United States

Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase reflects sales of $352.3 million as a result of the Merger and other acquisitions, primarily the consolidation of the Sirona businesses for ten months. This excludes approximately $11.9 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our combined businesses grew 1.0% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 2.3% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 40 basis points, which results in a negative internal sales growth rate of 0.9%. This was driven by lower sales in the Technologies & Equipment segment and was the result of lower purchases by a dealer compared to the prior period.

Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase reflects sales of $361.6 million as a result of the Merger and other acquisitions, primarily the consolidation of the Sirona businesses for ten months. This excludes approximately $1.6 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our combined businesses grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.0% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 70 basis points, which results in internal growth of 2.9%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Internal sales growth in this region was primarily driven by higher demand in the Consumables segment.

Rest of World

Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 71.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase reflects sales of $378.7 million as a result of the Merger and other acquisitions, primarily the consolidation of the Sirona businesses for ten months.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our combined businesses grew 8.2% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.9% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 30 basis points, which results in internal growth of 6.6%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were negatively impacted by approximately 1.2% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Internal sales growth in this region was driven by higher demand in both segments led by the Technologies & Equipment segment.

The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona’s lower operating expense rate and savings from the Company’s global efficiency and integration program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the Merger.

Restructuring and Other Costs

The Company recorded net restructuring and other costs of $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2016, restructuring costs were related to the closure and consolidation of facilities in an effort to streamline the Company’s operations and better leverage the Company’s resources. In 2015, the Company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Consumables segment.

In October 2016, the Company announced proposed plans in Germany to reorganize and combine portions of its manufacturing, logistics and distribution networks within both of the Company’s segments. As required under German law, the Company has entered into a statutory co-determination process under which it will collaborate with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative. The Company also initiated similar actions in other regions of the world. The Company estimates the cost of these initiatives to range up to $65 million, primarily for severance related benefits for employees, which is expected to be incurred as actions are implemented over the next two years.

Technologies & Equipment

Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by $966.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is a result of the Merger and other acquisitions, primarily the consolidation of the Sirona businesses for ten months. This excludes approximately $13.5 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our combined businesses grew 4.0% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 3.2% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 80 basis points, which results in internal growth of 1.6%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Sales growth in this segment reflects increased demand in the Rest of World region offset by sales declines in the United States which reflects lower purchases by a dealer compared to the prior year period.

The operating income increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 reflects the impact of the Merger.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND POLICIES

The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix and in some cases, actuarial techniques. The Company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate. Some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates. The Company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations.

Business Acquisitions

The Company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses. Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the Company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill. The assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations.

The Company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to determine the fair values include: tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals; evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information. If the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred, the Company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. The provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

The Company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach. In addition to minimum annual impairment tests, the Company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived assets might be impaired. If impairment related to goodwill is identified, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

59

Other Long-Lived Assets

Other long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with US GAAP, these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows, the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions. The resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.

Impairment Assessment

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions, particularly changes in the Company’s discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges. Information with respect to the Company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other long-lived assets are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing

Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. The valuation date for annual impairment testing is April 30. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment.

The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including future sales growth, operating margin growth, benefits from restructuring initiatives, tax rates, capital spending, business initiatives, and working capital changes. These assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. Operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved business-unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years. The weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the Company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the Company’s impairment analysis.

Should the Company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units, it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, “Intangibles, Goodwill and Other” during the three months ended March 31, 2017.

60

Annual Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradenames and are not subject to amortization; instead, they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow projections, a significant adverse change in legal factors used to evaluate the impairment of indefinite-lived assets.

The fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which values an indefinite-lived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. Under this method, an owner of an indefinite-lived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. The royalty, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. Management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, royalty rates and appropriate discount rates. Royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation. Other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Results

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill at April 30, 2017 on eleven reporting units. To determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model with market-based support as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units. The discounted cash flow model uses five- to ten-year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on a multiple of earnings or by capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate. In the development of the forecasted cash flows, the Company applies revenue, gross profit, and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as futures expectations. These future expectations include, but are not limited to, new product development and distribution channel changes for the respective reporting units. The Company also considers the current and projected market conditions for dental and medical device industries, both in the U.S. and globally, when determining its assumptions. The total forecasted cash flows were discounted based on a range between 7.8% to 9.5%, which included assumptions regarding the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital. The use of estimates and the development of assumptions results in uncertainties around forecasted cash flows. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Goodwill Testing Results

As a result of the annual impairment tests of goodwill and in conjunction with the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,092.9 million related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units all within the Technologies & Equipment segment. The goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by a change in forecasted sales and gross profit which resulted in a lower fair value for these reporting units.

For the Company’s reporting units that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. Had the WACC rate of each of these reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at April 30, 2017, the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value. If the fair value of each of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5% at April 30, 2017, the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net book value. If the fair value of each of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10% at April 30, 2017, one reporting unit, within the Company’s Consumables segment, would have a fair value that would approximate net book value. Goodwill for that reporting unit totals $54.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Company did not identify any impairment triggers related to this reporting unit at December 31, 2017.

61

In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified an impairment triggering event related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units. Forecasted revenues and operating margins for these reporting units were impacted by continued unfavorable developments in the marketplace which included an increase in competition. These developments resulted in significantly lower sales to end-users than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the North America and Rest of World regions as well as declines in expected gross profit rates which included the unfavorable impacts from changes in the foreign exchange rates. The impacts from foreign exchange rate changes were primarily driven by the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar as a result of the higher euro denominated costs and net assets associated with these reporting units as compared to the lower amount of euro denominated sales. While the Company considered unfavorable market developments and foreign exchange rate changes, in its April 30, 2017 assessment, the impact of these developments were at levels beyond those anticipated by the Company despite moving away from a non-exclusive distribution channel in the United States and the execution of new distribution agreements with Patterson Companies, Inc. and Henry Schein, Inc. in May and June of 2017. In addition to the unfavorable market and foreign exchange rate developments, the income tax rate forecast used in the annual goodwill test was unfavorably impacted by the recent tax legislation in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. As a result the Company tested these reporting units for impairment in preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and determined that the goodwill associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units, all within the Technologies & Equipment segment, was impaired. The impairment was the result of a change in forecasted sales and gross profit as well as changes in foreign exchange rates and the income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $558.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The combination of impairment charges for the second and fourth quarters of 2017 resulted in a total goodwill impairment charge of $1,650.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry, continued weakness in end-user demand for the Company’s products as a result of competition, an increase in discount rates, unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flow projections, foreign currency changes, unfavorable tax legislation among other factors, may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill may not be recoverable. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings.

Indefinite-lived and Definite-lived Intangible Assets Testing Results

The Company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 30, 2017, which largely consists of acquired tradenames, in conjunction with the annual impairment tests of goodwill. As a result of the annual impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $79.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 which was recorded in Restructuring and other costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impaired indefinite-lived intangibles assets are tradenames and trademarks related to the CAD/CAM and Imaging equipment reporting units. The impairment charge was primarily driven by a decline in forecasted sales. The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets contain uncertainties, and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment.

For the Company’s indefinite-lived assets that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. If the fair value of each of these indefinite-lived intangibles assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10% or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at April 30, 2017, the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value.

In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company, as result of the triggering event, tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to these reporting units for impairment As a result, the Company identified certain tradenames and trademarks related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units, all within the Technologies & Equipment segment, were impaired. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $266.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 which was recorded in Restructuring and other cost on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded a total impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $346.7 million related to indefinite-lived assets. The impairment charge was driven by a continuing decline in forecasted sales. The assumptions in a future impairment.

Slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry continued weakness in end-user demand for the Company’s products as a other factors, may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived and definite-lived assets may not be recoverable. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future indefinite-lived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings.

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are typically in the form of ranges, and the Company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges, when no other point within the ranges is a better estimate of the probable loss. The ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time. If the Company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible, it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability. These loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment. The Company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past; however, the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The Company’s tax expense includes the U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested.

The Company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.

Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely. At December 31, 2017, the Company has a valuation allowance of $3.0 billion against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries.

The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions. The reversal of accruals is recorded when examinations are completed, statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed.

The Company has accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis.  The accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but the Company has determined reasonable estimates for those effects.  The Company’s reasonable estimates are included in the financial statements at December 31, 2017 and expects to complete the accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $601.9 million compared to $563.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income declined by $1,981.7 million in the period ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, largely from non-cash impairments of goodwill and intangible assets totaling $1,997.6 million related to the Technologies & Equipment segment. Working capital consumed $149.3 million of operating cash flow in 2017 compared to $54.8 million consumed in 2016. Other non-cash charges increased approximately $116.3 million versus the prior year, largely driven by restructuring, management changes, amortization and legal settlements. The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $63.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $320.6 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, on a constant currency basis, the number of days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased by 3 days to 61 days as compared to 58 days in 2016. On a constant currency basis, the number of days of sales in inventory increased by 18 days to 131 days at December 31, 2017 as compared to 113 days at December 31, 2016.

Investing activities during 2017 included capital expenditures of $144.3 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets of $152.6 million. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $130 million to $140 million for the full year 2018.

63

At December 31, 2017, the Company had authorization to maintain up to 39.0 million shares of treasury stock under its stock repurchase program as approved by the Board of Directors. Under this program, the Company purchased approximately 6.2 million shares, or approximately 2.7% of average diluted shares outstanding, during 2017 at a cost of $400.3 million for an average price of $64.40. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held 37.7 million and 34.4 million shares of treasury stock, respectively. The Company also received proceeds of $82.3 million primarily as a result of 2.3 million stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program for a total remaining authorization of $500.0 million of shares of common stock. Additional share repurchases, if any, will be made through open market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions in such amounts and at such times as we deem appropriate based upon prevailing market and business conditions and other factors.

Total debt increased by $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Dentsply Sirona's long-term debt, including the current portion, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,620.8 million and $1,522.1 million, respectively. The Company's long-term debt, including the current portion increased by a net of $98.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This net change included a net increase in borrowings of $12.7 million, and a decrease of $111.4 million due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2017 there was $7.3 million outstanding under the commercial paper facility, at 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's ratio of net debt to total capitalization increased to 16.6% compared to 12.4% at December 31, 2016. Dentsply Sirona defines net debt as total debt, including current and long-term portions, less cash and cash equivalents and total capitalization as the sum of net debt plus total equity.

The Company has access to $500.0 million revolving credit facility through July 23, 2021. The facility is unsecured and contains certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the operations and financial condition of the Company. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income plus depreciation and amortization to interest expense.

The Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans and senior notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the Company's operations and financial condition. These credit agreements contain a number of covenants and two financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of total debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 0.6 to 1.0, and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the relevant agreement. Any breach of any such covenants or ratios would result in a default under the existing debt agreements that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle the Company's other lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

The Company also has access to $52.1 million in uncommitted short-term financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions. The lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the Company and the lending institutions. At December 31, 2017, $13.6 million was outstanding under these short-term lines of credit.  At December 31, 2017, the Company had total unused lines of credit related to the revolving credit agreement and the uncommitted short-term lines of credit of $531.2 million.

The Company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance cash requirements, including capital expenditures in a range of $130 million to $140 million, stock repurchases, debt service, operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, which is further discussed in Note 12, Financing Arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 in this Form 10-K. The Company intends to pay or refinance the current portion of long term debt due in 2018 utilizing cash or available credit. As noted in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 15 in this Form 10-K, the Company has continued to generate strong cash flows from operations, which has been used to finance the Company's activities.

At December 31, 2017, the majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States. The majority of the Company’s excess free cash flow is generated outside of the United States. Most of the foreign excess free cash flow could be repatriated to the United States. The Company expects to repatriate its foreign excess free cash flow (the amount in excess of capital investment and acquisition needs), subject to current regulations, to fund ongoing operations and capital needs. Historically, the Company has generated more than sufficient operating cash flows in the United States to fund domestic operations. Further, the Company expects on an ongoing basis, to be able to finance domestic and international cash requirements, including capital expenditures, stock repurchases, debt service, operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities.

64

As a result of U.S. tax reform, $271.7 million of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries was subject to current tax in the U.S. in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had not repatriated any of these funds to the U.S. However, to the extent the Company repatriates these funds to the U.S., the Company will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2017, the Company held $40.3 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions. Under these consignment arrangements, the financial institutions own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the Company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These consignment agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time, which is approximately the same time, and for the same price as alloys are sold to the Company's customers. In the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements, and if the Company could not obtain other comparable arrangements, the Company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels.

Contractual Obligations

The following table presents the Company's scheduled contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2017:

--------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ----- --------- ---- --------- ----- ------------------ ----- ----- ----- ------- - -------

Contractual Obligations Within1 Year Years 2-3 Years 4-5 GreaterThan5 Years Total

Long-term borrowings $ 9.2 $ 244.1 $ 298.9 $ 1,073.9 $ 1,626.1

Precious metal consignment agreements 40.3 — — — 40.3
 $ 134.1 $ 389.0 $ 419.7 $ 1,294.5 $ 2,237.3

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority; therefore, $24.7 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above (See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K).

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

['s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 15 in this Form 10-K, the Company has continued to generate strong cash flows from operations, which has been used to finance the Company']:
Item 15. Exhibits The following Consolidated Financial Statements, together with the Management's Report on Internal Control and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are listed below:

[") was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% in 2018 from 35%, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for enactment effects of SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the Act’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under Accounting Standards Codification No. 740 “Income Taxes”, (“ASC 740”). In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Act. The Company’s accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but the Company has determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a net provisional income tax charge of $20.1 million, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the consolidated statement of income.

Based on information available, the Company estimated the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings to be approximately $1.1 billion and recorded a provisional estimate of $62.2 million of income tax expense related to the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. There is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act, in particular as it relates to state income taxes. Further, the Company has not yet completed the analysis of the components of the computation, including the amount of the foreign earnings subject to U.S. income tax, and the portion of the foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. As of December 31, 2017, primarily due to the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain other tax attributes the estimated cash liability for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $1.0 million. However, as the Company completes its analysis an additional liability could be recorded and the Company would elect to make installment payments as allowed under the Act.

As a result of the Act, the Company can repatriate the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. The Company is still evaluating whether to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under SAB 118.

The remaining provisional amount is a benefit of $42.1 million relating to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities. For the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Act, a provisional estimate could not be made as the Company has not yet completed its assessment or elected an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or to record GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.

In accordance with SEC guidance, provisional amounts may be refined as a result of additional guidance from, and interpretations by, U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, and changes in assumptions. In the subsequent period, provisional amounts will be adjusted for the effects, if any, of interpretative guidance issued after January 19, 2018, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act may be subject to changes for items that were previously reported as provisional amounts, as well as any element of the 2017 Tax Act that a provisional estimate could not be made, and such changes could be material.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2017 included the net impact of restructuring program related costs and other costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $2,374.8 billion and $183.6 million, respectively.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2016 included the net impact of business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring program related costs and other costs, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $340.3 million and $153.1 million, respectively.

Net (Loss) Income attributable to Dentsply Sirona

In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net (loss) income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”). The Company discloses adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.

46

Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics.

The adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:

(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statement of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.
(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract terminations costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as, legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company’s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.
(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.
(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.
(5) Certain fair value adjustments related to an unconsolidated affiliated company. This adjustment represents the fair value adjustment of the unconsolidated affiliated company’s convertible debt instrument held by the Company. The affiliate is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The fair value adjustment is driven by open market pricing of the affiliate’s equity instruments, which has a high degree of variability and may not be indicative of the operating performance of the affiliate or the Company.
(6) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.
Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate. The non-US GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Technologies & Equipment

Reported net sales increased as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors in North America and Europe, that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, inventory held by these distributors increased by approximately $26 million during the current year compared to an increase of approximately $3 million in 2016. The inventory increase in 2017 was more than anticipated, in the Company’s assessment, as a result of lower equipment sales to end-users as well as higher than anticipated stocking of inventory by distributors in the U.S. The Company expects net sales during 2018 to be negatively impacted by approximately $40 million as a result of a planned reduction of inventory held at distributors.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses declined 0.1% on a constant currency basis. This rate, based on the Company’s estimate, was favorably impacted by changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors related to the transition in distribution strategy.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 3.7% on 1.2% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Sales growth in this segment reflects increased demand in the all regions.

The operating income increased $41.8 million or 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in sales, favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND POLICIES

 estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations.

Business Acquisitions

The Company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses. Acquired businesses are over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill. The assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations.

The Company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to determine the fair values include: tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals; evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information. If the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred, the Company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. The provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

The Company to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Impairment Assessment

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal The dynamic economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions 15 of this Form 10-K.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing

Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. The valuation date for annual impairment testing is April 30. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment.

The evaluation of impairment involves initiatives, and working capital changes. These assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. Operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved business-unit operating plans for the within the regions. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the Company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the Company’s impairment analysis.

Should the Company’s “Intangibles, Goodwill and Other” during the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Annual Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradenames or in the business climate, unanticipated competition or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinite-lived assets.

The fair value of acquired tradenames is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which values an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Results

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill at April 30, 2017 on eleven reporting units. cash flows. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Goodwill Testing Results

As a result of the annual impairment tests of goodwill and in conjunction with the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,092.9 million related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units all within the Technologies & Equipment segment. The goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by a change in forecasted sales and gross profit which resulted in a lower fair value for these reporting units.

For the Company’s reporting units that were not impaired, the Company applied a still exceed net book value. If the fair value of each of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 5% at April 30, 2017, the fair value of those reporting units would still exceed net value that would approximate net book value. Goodwill for that reporting unit totals $54.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Company did not identify any impairment triggers related to this reporting unit at December 31, 2017.

In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified an impairment triggering event related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment reporting units. Forecasted revenues and operating margins for these reporting units were impacted by continued unfavorable developments in the marketplace which included an increase in competition. These developments resulted in significantly lower sales to end-users than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the North America and Rest of World regions as well as declines in the Company considered unfavorable market developments and foreign exchange rate changes, in its April 30, 2017 assessment, the impact of these developments were at levels beyond those anticipated by tax legislation in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. As a result the Company tested these reporting units for impairment in preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December  was the result of a change in forecasted sales and gross profit as well as changes in foreign exchange rates and the income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $558.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry, continued weakness in end-user demand for the Company’s products as a result of competition, an increase a charge to earnings.

Indefinite-lived and Definite-lived Intangible Assets Testing Results

The Company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 30, 2017, recorded an impairment charge of $79.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 which was recorded in Restructuring and other costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impaired indefinite-lived and estimates used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets contain uncertainties, and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment.

For the Company’s indefinite-lived assets that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. If the fair value of each of these indefinite-lived intangibles assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10% or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at April 30, 2017, the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value.

In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company, as result of the triggering event, tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to these reporting Equipment segment, were impaired. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $266.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 which was recorded in Restructuring and other cost on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded a total impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $346.7 million related to indefinite-lived assets. The impairment charge was driven by and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment.

Slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry continued weakness in end-user demand for the Company’s products as a result of competition, an increase in discount rates, unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flow projections, foreign currency changes, unfavorable tax legislation among the Company’s future indefinite-lived asset impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings.
