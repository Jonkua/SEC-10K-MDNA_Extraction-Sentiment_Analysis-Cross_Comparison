MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

OVERVIEW
Business Activities
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through utilities in seven states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee, and Maryland. Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries (the Company) are also involved in several other complementary businesses.
The Company has four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations – and one non-reportable segment, all other. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information.
Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company's business. These factors include the ability to maintain safety, to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow natural gas sales and number of customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, environmental standards, reliability, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. The natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.
Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition Activities
On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the Merger, pursuant to which the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company. Southern Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Pushdown accounting was applied to create a new cost basis for the Company's assets, liabilities, and equity as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the successor financial statements reflect the new basis of accounting, and successor and predecessor period financial results (separated by a heavy black line) are presented, but are not comparable. As a result of the application of acquisition accounting, certain discussions herein include disclosure of the predecessor and successor periods. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Merger with Southern Company" for additional information.
In September 2016, the Company paid approximately $1.4 billion to acquire a 50% equity interest in SNG, which is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The investment in SNG is accounted for using the equity method. On March 31, 2017, the Company made an additional $50 million contribution to maintain its 50% equity interest in SNG. See Note 4 to the financial statements under "Equity Method Investments – SNG" and Note 11 to the financial statements under "Investment in SNG" for additional information.
In October 2016, the Company completed its purchase of Piedmont's 15% interest in SouthStar for $160 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements under "Variable Interest Entities" for additional information.
On October 15, 2017, the Company's subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, entered into agreements for the sale of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2017, the net book value of the assets to be disposed of in the sale was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $0.5 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and, as a result, a deferred tax liability has not yet been provided. Through the completion of the asset sales, the Company intends to invest less than $0.1 billion in capital additions required for ordinary business operations of these assets. The completion of each asset sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the FERC, the Federal Communications Commission, the New Jersey BPU, and, with respect to the sale of Elkton Gas, the Maryland PSC. The Company and South Jersey Industries, Inc. made joint filings on December 22, 2017 and January 16, 2018 with the New Jersey BPU and the Maryland PSC, respectively, requesting regulatory approval. The asset sales are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter 2018.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Operating Metrics
The Company continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

The Company measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on the Company's distribution system. With the exception of the Company's utilities in Illinois and Florida, the Company has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utilities' respective service territory. However, the utility customers in Illinois and the gas marketing services customers primarily in Georgia, Illinois, and Ohio can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. The Company utilizes weather hedges to reduce negative earnings impact in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining most of the earnings upside for these businesses.
The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia, Illinois, and Ohio.
The Company's natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.
See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on these operating metrics.
Seasonality of Results
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. The Company's base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing the Company's annual results. Thus, the Company's operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

--------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- - ---- ----- ---------- ----- -

 Percent Generated During Heating Season
 Operating Revenues EBIT Net Income
Successor - 2017 67.3 % 69.6 % 73.7 %
Successor - July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 67.1 % 81.5 % 96.5 %
Predecessor - January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 70.0 % 107.0 % 138.9 %
Predecessor - 2015 68.1 % 77.3 % 85.0 %

Earnings
Net income attributable to the Company for the successor year ended December 31, 2017 was $243 million, which included net income of $53 million from the Company's investment in SNG (including $18 million related to a non-cash charge recorded by SNG to establish a regulatory liability associated with the Tax Reform Legislation) and $44 million generated from the Company's continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas, less the associated increases in depreciation. Net income also reflects $130 million of additional tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets of $93 million related to the Tax Reform Legislation and $37 million associated with State of Illinois income tax legislation enacted in the third quarter 2017 and new income tax apportionment factors in several states resulting from the Company's inclusion in the consolidated Southern Company state tax filings. Also included in net income was $17 million of additional expense resulting from the pushdown of acquisition accounting. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters" herein and Notes 5 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Net income attributable to the Company for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $114 million, which included $26 million in earnings from the SNG investment, net of related interest expense, partially offset by $12 million of additional expense resulting from the impact of the pushdown of acquisition accounting and $27 million of Merger-related expenses.
Net income attributable to the Company for the predecessor periods of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 were $131 million and $353 million, respectively, which included $41 million and $26 million, respectively, of Merger-related expenses, and $14 million and $20 million, respectively, of net income attributable to the SouthStar

net of hedging. For the predecessor year ended December 31, 2015, natural gas revenues included a positive impact of $2 million also attributable to warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.
See "Segment Information" herein for additional information on wholesale gas services' revenues and losses.
Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information. Revenue impacts from weather and customer growth are described further below.
During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a significant net income impact during the non-Heating Season. The following table presents the Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where the Company's operations are impacted by weather.

----------- ------------------------ --------------- ----- ------------- ------------- -------- ----- --------------- -------- -- ---- -- ---- --

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Cost of Natural Gas and Other Sales
Natural gas costs are the largest expense for the Company. Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 79.6% of total cost of natural gas for 2017.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion for the successor year ended December 31, 2017, which reflected an increase in natural gas pricing of 26.3% during the year compared to 2016, partially offset by lower demand for natural gas.
For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, cost of natural gas was $613 million and reflected low demand for natural gas driven by warm weather in the fourth quarter 2016.
Cost of natural gas was $755 million and $1.6 billion for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and reflected low demand for natural gas driven by warm weather during those periods.
The following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.

Effects of Inflation
The Company is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on the Company's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.
Performance and Non-GAAP Measures
Prior to the Merger, the Company evaluated segment performance using EBIT, which includes operating income, earnings from equity method investments, and other income (expense), net. EBIT excludes interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and income taxes (benefit), which were evaluated on a consolidated basis for those periods. EBIT is used herein to discuss the results of the Company's segments for the predecessor periods, as EBIT was the primary measure of segment profit or loss for those periods. Subsequent to the Merger, the Company changed its segment performance measure from EBIT to net income to better align with the performance measure utilized by Southern Company. EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 presented herein is considered a non-GAAP measure. The Company also discusses consolidated EBIT, which is considered a non-GAAP measure for all periods presented. The presentation of consolidated EBIT is believed to provide useful supplemental information regarding a consolidated measure of profit or loss. The Company further believes the presentation of segment EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 is useful as it allows for a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital and legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to different interest rates and effective tax rates. The applicable reconciliations of net income to consolidated EBIT and segment EBIT are provided herein.
Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and Merger-related expenses, which are included in the calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. The Company further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.
EBIT and adjusted operating margin should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, the Company's operating performance than net income attributable to the Company or operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Company's financial performance.
Reconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating margin and net income attributable to Southern Company Gas to EBIT are as follows:

Change in Commercial Activity
The commercial activity at wholesale gas services includes recognition of storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur. Warmer-than-normal weather during the 2016/2017 Heating Season, lower power generation volumes, and build-out of new U.S. pipeline infrastructure, along with increases in natural gas supply, caused low volatility and a tightening of locational or transportation spreads throughout the majority of 2017, negatively impacting the amount of commercial activity revenues generated relative to demand fees for contracted pipeline transportation and storage capacity, and minimum sharing under asset management agreements. However, during December 2017, significantly colder weather increased natural gas price volatility and transportation spreads widened, enabling wholesale gas services to capture higher commercial activity. Further, as natural gas prices and forward storage or time spreads increased, wholesale gas services was able to capture higher storage values that it expects to recognize as commercial activity revenues when natural gas is physically withdrawn from storage.
Change in Storage and Transportation Derivatives
Volatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on the Company's customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas services to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Transportation and forward commodity derivative losses are primarily the result of widening transportation spreads during the fourth quarter 2017 due to significantly colder weather in the Northeast and Midwest U.S., which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points. Additionally, during 2017, forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of wholesale gas services' specific storage positions resulted in storage derivative gains.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

The natural gas that the Company purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. Wholesale gas services recorded LOCOM adjustments of $19 million for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2015. LOCOM adjustments for all other periods presented were immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Natural Gas for Sale" for additional information.
Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation Transactions
The expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, but are net of the estimated impact of profit sharing under its asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2017. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
General
The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of the Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company's primary business of natural gas distribution and its complementary businesses in the gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations sectors. These factors include the Company's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that allows for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, the Company's ability to optimize its transportation and storage positions, and its ability to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices.
Future earnings will be driven primarily by customer growth and are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company's service territories. Demand for natural gas is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
Volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on the Company's customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of its gas marketing services and wholesale gas services segments to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of the Company's operations to earnings variability. Over the longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, including the new housing market, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018, which among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% and changes rates of depreciation and the business interest deduction. On July 6, 2017, the State of Illinois enacted tax legislation that repealed its non-combination tax rule and increased the effective corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2017. In addition, Southern Company calculated new apportionment factors in several states to include the Company in its consolidated tax filings. See "Income Tax Matters" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Notes 3 and 5 to the financial statements for additional information.
As part of its business strategy, the Company regularly considers and evaluates joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets. On October 15, 2017, the Company's subsidiary Pivotal Utility Holdings entered into agreements for the sale of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc.; the asset sales are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter 2018. Net income attributable to Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $34 million. However, due to the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and other factors including, but not limited to, weather, regulation, competition,

II-566

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

customer demand, and general economic conditions, the 2017 net income is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other period. See BUSINESS – "Seasonality" in Item 1, RISK FACTORS in Item 1A, and Note 11 to the financial statements under "Proposed Sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas" for additional information.
Environmental Matters
The Company's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. The Company maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations may impact future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. A major portion of these compliance costs are expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. The ultimate impact of the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.
New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of the Company's operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for natural gas. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Matters" for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Company is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 46 former MGP sites in five different states. The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized the costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. Accrued environmental remediation costs totaling $388 million were included in the balance sheets at December 31, 2017, $46 million of which is expected to be incurred over the next 12 months. The natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida have all received authority from their respective state regulators to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms, which covers substantially all of the total accrued remediation costs. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" herein for additional information.
Water Quality
In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all Clean Water Act programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, and canals), which could impact permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of pipeline projects. On July 27, 2017, the EPA and the Corps proposed to rescind the 2015 WOTUS rule. The WOTUS rule has been stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit since late 2015, but on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that federal district courts have jurisdiction over the pending challenges to the rule. On February 6, 2018, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule delaying implementation of the 2015 WOTUS rule to 2020.
FERC Matters
The Company is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects within gas midstream operations. These projects, along with the Company's existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served. The following table provides an overview of these pipeline projects.

(b) In 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will run from West Virginia through Virginia and into eastern North Carolina to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas. The proposed pipeline project is expected to transport natural gas to customers in Virginia. On October 13, 2017, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project received FERC approval. The joint venture continues to work with state and other federal agencies to obtain the required environmental permits to begin construction.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) In 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will transport low-cost natural gas from the Marcellus Shale area to customers in New Jersey. The Company believes this will alleviate takeaway constraints in the Marcellus region and help mitigate some of the price volatility experienced during recent winters. On January 19, 2018, the PennEast Pipeline project received FERC approval. The joint venture continues to work with state and other federal agencies to obtain the required environmental permits to begin construction.

On August 1, 2017, the Dalton Pipeline, which serves as an extension of the Transco pipeline system and provides additional natural gas supply to customers in Georgia, was placed in service. The Company has a 50% ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.
On January 16, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved SNG's purchase of Georgia Power Company's natural gas lateral pipeline serving Plant McDonough Units 4 through 6 at net book value. Pursuant to this approval, legal transfer of the lateral pipeline is expected to occur in the fourth quarter 2018 and payment of $142 million is expected to occur in the first quarter 2020. During this interim period, Georgia Power Company will receive a discounted shipping rate to reflect the delayed consideration. Completion of this sale is contingent on certain conditions being satisfied by SNG that include, among other things, expansion of the existing lateral pipeline. The Company's portion of the expected capital expenditures for this project is $120 million. On February 15, 2018, FERC approval was obtained. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Regulatory Matters
Utility Regulation and Rate Design
The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies for the rates charged to their customers, maintenance of accounting records, and various service and safety matters. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.
The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. The Marketers file their rates monthly with the Georgia PSC. As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light's role includes:

- ---------------------------------------
• distributing natural gas for Marketers;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• constructing, operating, and maintaining the gas system infrastructure, including responding to customer service calls and leaks;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• reading meters and maintaining underlying customer premise information for Marketers; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• planning and contracting for capacity on interstate transportation and storage systems.

Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. The Company has various mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, at most of its utilities that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.

II-568

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC specific to Georgia's deregulated market. In addition to natural gas recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. Three of the utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that the Company believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on the Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Regulatory Matters" for additional information.
The following table provides regulatory information for the Company's six largest natural gas distribution utilities:

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(h) See "Base Rate Cases" herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Regulatory Matters – Base Rate Cases" for additional information.

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
The Company continues to focus on capital discipline and cost control while pursuing projects and initiatives that are expected to have current and future benefits to customers, provide an appropriate return on invested capital, and help ensure the safety and reliability of the utility infrastructure. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2017 for gas distribution operations were $1.3 billion. The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs at the natural gas distribution utilities, which are designed to update or expand the Company's distribution systems to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth.

Nicor Gas
In 2013, Illinois enacted legislation that allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system. The legislation stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois

II-570

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, under which Nicor Gas implemented rates that became effective in March 2015. Nicor Gas expects to place into service $350 million of qualifying projects under Investing in Illinois in 2018.
Investing in Illinois is subject to annual review by the Illinois Commission. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Illinois Commission on January 31, 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering the portion of these program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates. See "Base Rate Cases" herein for additional information.
Atlanta Gas Light
Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program, which was initially approved by the Georgia PSC in 2009, is comprised of i-SRP, i-CGP, and i-VPR, and consists of infrastructure development, enhancement, and replacement programs that are used to update and expand distribution systems and LNG facilities, improve system reliability, and meet operational flexibility and growth. For 2017 and subsequent years, the recovery of and return on current and future capital investments under the STRIDE program are included in the annual base rate revenue adjustment under GRAM.
The i-CGP program authorized Atlanta Gas Light to spend $91 million through 2017 on projects to extend its pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. This program ended in 2017 and was replaced with a tariff to provide up to $15 million annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects.
The i-SRP program authorized $445 million of capital spending through 2017 for projects to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia, improve its peak-day system reliability and operational flexibility, and create a platform to meet long-term forecasted growth. In August 2016, Atlanta Gas Light filed a petition with the Georgia PSC for approval of a four-year extension of its i-SRP seeking approval to invest an additional $177 million to improve and upgrade its core gas distribution system in years 2017 through 2020.
The i-VPR program authorized Atlanta Gas Light to spend $275 million through 2017 to replace 756 miles of aging plastic pipe that was installed primarily in the mid-1960s to the early 1980s. Atlanta Gas Light has identified approximately 3,300 miles of vintage plastic mains in its system that should be considered for potential replacement.
See "Base Rate Cases" herein for additional information on GRAM.
Elizabethtown Gas
Elizabethtown Gas' 2013 extension of the AIR enhanced infrastructure program allowed for infrastructure investment of $115 million over four years and was focused on the replacement of aging cast iron in its pipeline system. Carrying charges on the additional capital spend are being accrued and deferred for regulatory purposes at a weighted average cost of capital of 6.65%. Effective July 1, 2017, investments under this program, which ended September 30, 2017, are being recovered through base rate revenues. See "Base Rate Cases" herein for additional information.
In 2015, Elizabethtown Gas filed the Safety, Modernization and Reliability Tariff plan with the New Jersey BPU seeking approval to invest more than $1.1 billion to replace 630 miles of vintage cast iron, steel, and copper pipeline, as well as 240 regulator stations. During the first quarter 2018, Elizabethtown Gas withdrew this filing in response to a proposed rule by the New Jersey BPU to incentivize utilities to accelerate investment in infrastructure replacement programs that enhance reliability, resiliency, and/or safety of the distribution system. Elizabethtown Gas expects to file a revised plan during the second half of 2018. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
In 2012, the Virginia Commission approved the SAVE program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, to be completed over a five-year period. This program included a maximum allowance for capital expenditures of $25 million per year, not to exceed $105 million in total.
In March 2016, the Virginia Commission approved an extension to the SAVE program for Virginia Natural Gas to replace more than 200 miles of aging pipeline infrastructure and invest up to $30 million in 2016 and up to $35 million annually through 2021. Virginia Natural Gas expects to invest $35 million under this program in 2018.
The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Virginia Commission on December 21, 2017, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering the portion of these program costs incurred prior to September 1, 2017 through base rates. See "Base Rate Cases" herein for additional information.

II-571

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Florida City Gas
In 2015, the Florida PSC approved Florida City Gas' SAFE, under which costs incurred for replacing aging pipes are recovered through a rate rider with annual adjustments and true-ups. Under the program, Florida City Gas is authorized to spend $105 million over a 10-year period on infrastructure relocation and enhancement projects. Florida City Gas expects to invest $10 million under this program in 2018.
PRP Settlement
In 2015, Atlanta Gas Light received a final order from the Georgia PSC for a rate true-up of allowed unrecovered revenue through 2014 related to its PRP. This order allows Atlanta Gas Light to recover $144 million of the $178 million previously unrecovered program revenue. The remaining $34 million requested related primarily to previously unrecognized ratemaking amounts and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company also recognized $1 million of interest expense and $5 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the PRP on the Company's statements of income for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2015. See "Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts" herein for additional information.
As a result of the PRP settlement, Atlanta Gas Light began recovering incremental PRP surcharge amounts through three phased in increases in addition to its already existing PRP surcharge amount, which was established to address recovery of the unrecovered PRP balance of $144 million in 2015 and the estimated amounts to be earned under the program through 2025. The initial incremental surcharge of approximately $15 million annually was effective in October 2015, with additional annual increases of approximately $15 million in each of October 2016 and 2017. The final increase scheduled for October 2017 was included in the implementation of GRAM in March 2017. The under recovered balance is the result of the continued revenue requirement earned under the program offset by the existing and incremental PRP surcharges. The unrecovered balance at December 31, 2017 was $187 million, including $104 million of unrecognized equity return. The PRP surcharge will remain in effect until the earlier of the full recovery of the under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. See "Base Rate Cases" herein for additional information on GRAM.
One of the capital projects under the PRP experienced construction issues and Atlanta Gas Light was required to complete mitigation work prior to placing it in service. These mitigation costs will be included in future base rates in 2018. Provisions in the order resulted in the recognition of $5 million in operations and maintenance expense for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2015 on the Company's statements of income. In 2017, Atlanta Gas Light recovered $20 million from the settlement of contractor litigation claims and continues to pursue contractual and legal claims against a third-party contractor. Mitigation costs recovered through the legal process are retained by Atlanta Gas Light. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Base Rate Cases
Settled Base Rate Cases
On February 21, 2017, the Georgia PSC approved GRAM and a $20 million increase in annual base rate revenues for Atlanta Gas Light, effective March 1, 2017. GRAM adjusts base rates annually, up or down, using an earnings band based on the previously approved ROE of 10.75% and does not collect revenue through special riders and surcharges. Atlanta Gas Light adjusts rates up to the lower end of the band of 10.55% and adjusts rates down to the higher end of the band of 10.95%. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC under Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program, which include i-VPR and i-SRP, will continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments will be included in annual base rate adjustments. The Georgia PSC will review Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM.
Pursuant to the GRAM approval, Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC agreed to a variation to the i-CGP that was formerly part of Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program. As a result, a new tariff was created, effective October 10, 2017, to provide up to $15 million annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects. Projects under this tariff must be approved by the Georgia PSC.
Beginning with the next rate adjustment in June 2018, Atlanta Gas Light's recovery of the previously unrecovered Pipeline Replacement Program revenue through 2014, as well as the mitigation costs associated with the Pipeline Replacement Program that were not previously included in its rates, will also be included in GRAM. In connection with the GRAM approval, the last monthly Pipeline Replacement Program surcharge increase became effective March 1, 2017.
On June 30, 2017, the New Jersey BPU approved a settlement that provides for a $13 million increase in annual base rate revenues, effective July 1, 2017, based on a ROE of 9.6%. Also included in the settlement was a new composite depreciation rate that is expected to result in a $3 million annual reduction of depreciation. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Proposed Sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas" for information on the proposed sale of Elizabethtown Gas.

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

On December 21, 2017, the Virginia Commission approved a settlement for a $34 million increase in annual base rate revenues, effective September 1, 2017, including $13 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program. See "Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" herein for additional information. An authorized ROE range of 9.0% to 10.0% with a midpoint of 9.5% will be used to determine the revenue requirement in any filing, other than for a change in base rates.
On January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.
Pending Base Rate Cases
On October 23, 2017, Florida City Gas filed a general base rate case with the Florida PSC requesting a $19 million increase in annual base rate revenues. On January 29, 2018, Florida City Gas filed an update to incorporate the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation that, if approved, would reduce the requested base rate revenues by $4 million. The requested increase is based on a 2018 projected test year and a ROE of 11.25%. The requested increase includes $3 million related to the recovery of investments under SAFE that are currently being recovered through a surcharge. Additionally, Florida City Gas requested an interim rate increase of $5 million annually that was approved and became effective January 12, 2018, subject to refund. The Florida PSC is expected to rule on the requested increase in mid-2018.
On December 1, 2017, Atlanta Gas Light filed its 2018 annual rate adjustment with the Georgia PSC. If approved, annual base rate revenues will increase by $22 million, effective June 1, 2018. Atlanta Gas Light will file a revised rate adjustment to incorporate the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation in the first quarter 2018. The Georgia PSC is expected to rule on the revised requested increase in the second quarter 2018.
On February 15, 2018, Chattanooga Gas filed a general base rate case with the Tennessee Public Utility Commission requesting a $7 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase, which incorporated the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, was based on a projected test year ending June 30, 2019 and a ROE of 11.25%. The Tennessee Public Utility Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase in the third quarter 2018.
The ultimate outcome of these pending base rate cases cannot be determined at this time.
Other
The New Jersey BPU, Virginia Commission, Tennessee Public Utility Commission, and Maryland PSC each issued an order effective January 1, 2018 that requires utilities in their respective states to track as a regulatory liability the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, including the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% and the impact of excess deferred income taxes. The New Jersey BPU's order requires Elizabethtown Gas to file by March 2, 2018 proposed revised base rates with an April 1, 2018 interim effective date and a July 1, 2018 final effective date. Virginia Natural Gas will address the Virginia Commission's order in its Annual Information Filing, which will be filed by July 1, 2018. The Tennessee Public Utility Commission's order required Chattanooga Gas to file proposals to reduce rates or make other ratemaking adjustments to account for the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. Chattanooga Gas made the required filing as part of its February 15, 2018 general base rate case filing. The Maryland PSC's order required Elkton Gas to file an explanation of the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation on its expenses and revenues, as well as when and how it expects to pass through to its customers those effects. Elkton Gas made the required filing on February 15, 2018 and will reduce annual base rates by $0.1 million effective April 1, 2018. Credits will be issued to customers for the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 2018 through March 2018.
The Illinois Commission issued an order effective January 25, 2018 that requires utilities in the state to record the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, including the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% and the impact of excess deferred income taxes, as a regulatory liability. On February 20, 2018, the Illinois Commission granted Nicor Gas' application for rehearing to file revised base rates and tariffs, which Nicor Gas expects to file by the end of the second quarter 2018.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Asset Management Agreements
All of the natural gas distribution utilities except Nicor Gas use asset management agreements with the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent, for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are controlled by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to the utility customers. Currently, the Company's utilities primarily purchase their gas

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

from Sequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but these natural gas distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best interest of their customers.
Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utilities through either an annual minimum guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee. From the inception of these agreements in 2001 through December 31, 2017, Sequent made sharing payments to the natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements totaling $390 million.
The following table provides payments made by Sequent to the natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements during the last three years:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Income Tax Matters
Federal Tax Reform Legislation
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retains normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax.
For businesses other than regulated utilities, the Tax Reform Legislation allows 100% bonus depreciation of qualified property acquired and placed in service between September 28, 2017 and January 1, 2023 and phases down by 20% each year until completely phased out for qualified property placed in service after December 31, 2027. Further, the business interest deduction is limited to 30% of taxable income excluding interest, net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, and depreciation and amortization through December 31, 2021 and thereafter to 30% of taxable income excluding interest and NOL carryforwards.
Regulated utility businesses, including the natural gas distribution companies, can continue deducting all business interest expense and are not eligible for bonus depreciation on capital assets acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017. Projects with binding contracts before September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.
In addition, under the the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, implementation of the Tax Reform Legislation resulted in an estimated net tax expense of $93 million and a $777 million increase in regulatory liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate on deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Tax Reform Legislation is subject to further interpretation and guidance from the IRS, as well as each respective state's adoption. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and the relevant state regulatory bodies as further described in Note 3 to the financial statements under "Base Rate Cases" and "Other" for additional information.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Credit Rating Risk" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Bonus Depreciation
Under the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $200 million for the 2017 tax year and approximately $60 million for the 2018 tax year. Should Southern Company have a NOL in 2018, all of these cash flows may not be fully realized in 2018. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
State Tax Reform Legislation
On July 6, 2017, the State of Illinois enacted tax legislation that repealed its non-combination tax rule and increased the effective corporate income tax rate from 5.25% to 7.0% (making the total corporate tax rate 9.5% when combined with the 2.5% personal property replacement tax) effective July 1, 2017. In addition to increasing taxes on future earnings, this legislation required the Company to increase accumulated deferred income tax liabilities by $24 million during the third quarter 2017 to reflect these changes, of which $15 million was expensed and $9 million was recorded as a regulatory asset.
Change in State Apportionment Factors
Southern Company calculated new apportionment factors in several states to include the Company in its consolidated tax filings, which resulted in $22 million of additional deferred income tax expenses in the successor year ended December 31, 2017.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Other Matters
The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Nicor Gas and Nicor Energy Services Company, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and Nicor Inc. were defendants in a putative class action initially filed in 2011 in the state court in Cook County, Illinois. The plaintiffs purported to represent a class of the customers who purchased the Gas Line Comfort Guard product from Nicor Energy Services Company and variously alleged that the marketing, sale, and billing of the Gas Line Comfort Guard product violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, constituting common law fraud and resulting in unjust enrichment of these entities. The plaintiffs sought, on behalf of the classes they purported to represent, actual and punitive damages, interest, costs, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. On February 8, 2017, the judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and the Company's motion for summary judgment. On March 7, 2017, the parties reached a settlement, which was finalized and effective on April 3, 2017. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
The Company is assessing its alleged involvement in an incident that occurred in one of its service territories that resulted in several deaths, injuries, and property damage. One of the natural gas distribution utilities has been named as one of the defendants in several lawsuits related to this incident. The Company has insurance that provides full coverage of any financial exposure in excess of $11 million per incident. During the successor period ended December 31, 2016 and the predecessor period ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded reserves for substantially all of its potential exposure from these cases.
The ultimate outcome of these matters and such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Note 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "General Litigation Matters" for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.
The Company owns a 50% interest in a planned LNG liquefaction and storage facility in Jacksonville, Florida. Once construction is complete and the facility is operational, it will be outfitted with a 2.0 million gallon storage tank with the capacity to produce in excess of 120,000 gallons of LNG per day. It is expected to be operational in the first half of 2018. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in the Company retiring the cavern early. At December 31, 2017, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of $112 million, of which the cavern itself represents approximately 20%. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.
The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. The Company intends to monitor the cavern and comply with the Louisiana DNR order through 2020 and place the cavern back in service in 2021. These events were considered in connection with the Company's annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2017. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company conformed its paid time off policy to align with Southern Company. Under the new policy, paid time off days are vested by the employee on the first day of each year and will continue to be recovered through rates on an as-paid basis. As a result, the Company accrued $21 million as of January 1, 2018, of which $9 million was recorded as a regulatory asset.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the

II-576

    Table of Contents                            Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Company's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.
Utility Regulation
The natural gas distribution utilities comprised approximately 82% of the Company's total operating revenues for 2017 and are subject to rate regulation by their respective state regulatory agencies, which set the rates utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on the Company's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.
As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the Company's financial statements.
Accounting for Income Taxes
The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the many states in which the Company operates.
On behalf of the Company, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of the Company's, as well as Southern Company's, current financial position and result of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.
Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments, the Company considers state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.
Federal Tax Reform Legislation
Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provides for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes, and their application under GAAP, the Company considers all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation to be "provisional" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision. The Company is awaiting additional guidance from industry and income tax authorities in order to finalize its

II-577

accounting. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related regulatory liabilities cannot be determined at this time. See "Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation" herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Base Rate Cases" and "Other" and Note 5 to the financial statements under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.
Assessment of Assets
Goodwill
The Company does not amortize its goodwill, but tests it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.
As part of the Company's impairment test, the Company may perform an initial qualitative Step 0 assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the Company elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it performs the two-step goodwill impairment test.
Step 1 of the two-step goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the result of the Step 1 test reveals that the estimated fair value is below its carrying value, the Company proceeds with Step 2.
Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill, which is calculated as the residual amount from the reporting unit's overall fair value after assigning fair values to its assets and liabilities under a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination, to its carrying value. Based on the result of the Step 2 test, the Company records a goodwill impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill.
For the 2017 annual impairment test, the Company performed Step 1 of the two-step impairment test, which resulted in the fair value of all of its reporting units that have goodwill exceeding their carrying value. For the 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests, the Company performed the qualitative Step 0 assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative analysis was required. In the third quarter 2015, the Company identified potential impairment indicators and performed an interim impairment test for its storage and fuels reporting unit, which resulted in impairment of the full $14 million goodwill balance for that reporting unit.
As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the Company considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See "Recently Issued Accounting Standards – Other" herein for information on the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 effective January 1, 2018.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company depreciates or amortizes its long-lived and intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The Company assesses its long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the Company records an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.
As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the Company considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.

Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2017 Annual Report

Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is voluminous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in the Company's assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.
Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.
Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are recorded in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.
Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas utilize derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.
The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent the Company hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in the Company's results of operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.
The Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);

- --------------------------------------------
• events specific to a given counterparty; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• the impact of the Company's nonperformance risk on its liabilities.

If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions the Company uses in pricing its derivative assets or liabilities, the Company may experience a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, the Company considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Market Price Risk" herein for more information.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over

future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations.
Key elements in determining the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on the Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to the Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining its liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. Prior to 2016, the Company computed the interest cost component of its net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense using the same single-point discount rate. In 2016, the Company adopted a full yield curve approach for calculating the interest cost component whereby the discount rate for each year is applied to the liability for that specific year. As a result, the interest cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense decreased by approximately $7 million in 2016.
A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salaries, or long-term return on plan assets) would result in a $2 million or less change in total annual benefit expense and a $42 million or less change in projected obligations.
See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").
