Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview
We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are tailored uniquely across our portfolio of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand.
We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 3, 2018, our operating segments included Gap Global, Old Navy Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment.
Fiscal 2017 consisted of 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2016 and 2015. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week.
On August 29, 2016, a fire occurred in one of the buildings at a Company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York ("the Fishkill fire"). In January 2018, the Company agreed upon a final settlement with its insurers and all insurance proceeds were received as of February 3, 2018.
In May 2016, we announced measures to better align talent and financial resources against our most important priorities to position the Company for improved business performance and long-term success. Our aim is to capture additional market share in our home market, North America, where we have our largest structural advantages, and to focus on international regions with the greatest potential. As part of this effort, we closed the entire fleet of 53 Old Navy stores in Japan during fiscal 2016. Japan remains an important market for the Company's portfolio, with a continued strong presence of approximately 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores. Including the Old Navy closures in Japan, the Company closed 67 stores in total related to these measures in fiscal 2016.
We also took steps toward creating a more efficient operating model, enabling us to more fully leverage our scale. For example, we centralized or consolidated several brand and corporate functions, allowing us to simplify the organization and operate more efficiently.
In connection with the decision to close stores and streamline the Company's operations, the Company incurred $197 million in restructuring costs during fiscal 2016 on a pre-tax basis. The charges primarily include lease termination fees, employee-related costs, and store asset impairment. Certain of the costs incurred in foreign subsidiaries did not result in a tax benefit.

19

Fiscal 2015 results were impacted by a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance in the future, including rightsizing the Gap brand store fleet primarily in North America, streamlining the brand's headquarter workforce, and developing a clear, on-brand product aesthetic framework to strengthen the Gap brand to compete more successfully on the global stage. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the closure of about 150 Gap global specialty stores related to the strategic actions. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $132 million of charges in connection with the strategic actions, primarily consisting of impairment of store assets related to underperforming stores, lease termination fees and lease losses, employee-related expenses, and impairment of inventory that did not meet brand standards.
Financial results for fiscal 2017 are as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 2 percent to $15.9 billion compared with $15.5 billion for fiscal 2016.

- -----------------------------------------------------
• Comparable sales for fiscal 2017 increased 3 percent.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross profit for fiscal 2017 was $6.1 billion compared with $5.6 billion for fiscal 2016. Gross margin for fiscal 2017 was 38.3 percent compared with 36.3 percent for fiscal 2016.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating margin for fiscal 2017 was 9.3 percent compared with 7.7 percent for fiscal 2016. Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of net sales.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net income for fiscal 2017 was $848 million compared with $676 million for fiscal 2016, and diluted earnings per share was $2.14 for fiscal 2017 compared with $1.69 for fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included about a $0.10 benefit from the gain from insurance proceeds related to the Fishkill fire and an unfavorable net provisional tax impact of federal tax reform of about $0.09. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 included about a $0.41 impact of restructuring costs incurred during fiscal 2016, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $0.18 related to Intermix, an $0.11 benefit from the gain from insurance proceeds related to the Fishkill fire, and a favorable income tax impact of a legal structure realignment of about $0.15.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During fiscal 2017, we distributed $676 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Our business priorities in 2018 include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• offering product that is consistently brand-appropriate and on-trend with high customer acceptance, with a focus on expanding our advantage in loyalty categories;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• investing in digital and customer capabilities to support growth;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• creating a unique and differentiated shopping experience that attracts new customers and builds loyalty, with focus on both the physical and digital expressions of our brands;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increasing productivity by leveraging our scale and streamlining operations and processes throughout the organization;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• continuing to integrate social and environmental sustainability into business practices to support long term growth; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• attracting and retaining strong talent in our businesses and functions.

In fiscal 2018, we are focused on investing strategically in the business while maintaining operating expense discipline and driving efficiency through our productivity initiative. One of our primary objectives is to continue transforming our product to market process, with the development of a more efficient operating model, allowing us to more fully leverage our scale. To enable this, we have several product, supply chain, and IT initiatives underway. Further, we expect to continue our investment in customer experience to drive higher customer engagement and loyalty across all of our brands and channels, resulting in market share gains. Finally, we will continue to invest in strengthening brand awareness, customer acquisition, and digital capabilities. Underpinning these strategies is a focus on utilizing data, analytics, and technology to respond faster while making decisions that will fuel market share gains and lead to a more nimble organization.
Fiscal 2018 will consist of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2017.

Results of Operations
Net Sales
See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand and region.

Comparable Sales ("Comp Sales")
The percentage change in Comp Sales by global brand and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

---------------------- ----------- -- ---- -- ---- --- --

 Fiscal Year
 2017 2016 2015
Gap Global (1 )% (3 )% (6 )%
Old Navy Global 6 % 1 % — %
Banana Republic Global (2 )% (7 )% (10 )%
The Gap, Inc. 3 % (2 )% (4 )%

Comp Sales include the results of Company-operated stores and sales through online channels in those countries where we have existing comparable store sales. The calculation of The Gap, Inc. Comp Sales includes the results of Athleta and Intermix but excludes the results of our franchise business.
A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp Sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales.
A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.
A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.
Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp Sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

Gap and Banana Republic outlet and factory stores are reflected in each of the respective brands.
In fiscal 2018, we expect net openings of about 25 Company-operated store locations, primarily for Old Navy and Athleta, with closures weighted toward Gap brand and Banana Republic.

Net Sales Discussion
Our net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $339 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in net sales at Old Navy and Athleta, partially offset by a decrease in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $11 million for fiscal 2017 and is calculated by translating net sales for fiscal 2016 at exchange rates applicable during fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2017 includes incremental sales attributable to the 53rd week.
Our net sales for fiscal 2016 decreased $281 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic, partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy and Athleta. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $20 million for fiscal 2016 and is calculated by translating net sales for fiscal 2015 at exchange rates applicable during fiscal 2016.
In fiscal 2018, we will return to a 52-week fiscal year which could potentially impact the seasonality of net sales throughout the year as a result of the calendar shift of our fiscal quarters in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----- ---- ---- - ----- ---- - - ------

($ in millions) Fiscal Year
 2017 2016 2015
Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses $ 9,789 $ 9,876 $ 10,077
Gross profit $ 6,066 $ 5,640 $ 5,720
Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 61.7 % 63.7 % 63.8 %
Gross margin 38.3 % 36.3 % 36.2 %

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 2.0 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cost of goods sold decreased 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher margins achieved as a result of improved average selling price per unit at all global brands; partially offset by higher average unit cost at all global brands. This was offset by a negative foreign exchange impact for our foreign subsidiaries as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Occupancy expenses decreased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016, primarily driven by an increase in online sales without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses, international store closures, and higher sales from the impact of the 53rd week; partially offset by real estate expenses for the Times Square New York location for Gap and Old Navy.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cost of goods sold decreased 0.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily driven by higher selling at regular prices at all global brands and improved product acceptance resulting in improved margins at Old Navy. This was offset by a negative foreign exchange impact for our foreign subsidiaries as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses.

In fiscal 2018, we currently expect that gross margins for our foreign subsidiaries, net of the impact from our merchandise hedge program, will be slightly favorable due to the appreciation of certain foreign currencies as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

Operating Expenses and Operating Margin

----------------------------------------------- ---- ----------- ----- ---- - ----- ---- - - -----

($ in millions) Fiscal Year
 2017 2016 2015
Operating expenses $ 4,587 $ 4,449 $ 4,196
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 28.9 % 28.7 % 26.6 %
Operating margin 9.3 % 7.7 % 9.6 %

Operating expenses increased $138 million or 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in variable costs, such as payroll-related costs, due to the growth in Old Navy and Athleta brands, increase in bonus expense, and the 53rd week impact;

- -------------------------------
• an increase in advertising; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in overhead costs related to productivity work including investments in customer and digital initiatives as well as severance expenses and the impacts of store closures; partially offset by

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a gain from insurance proceeds of $64 million related to the Fishkill fire recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $197 million of restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2016; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $71 million related to a goodwill impairment charges for Intermix in fiscal year 2016.

Operating expenses increased $253 million or 2.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• restructuring costs of $197 million in fiscal 2016 compared with the costs related to strategic actions of $98 million in fiscal 2015;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• store asset impairment charges of $53 million unrelated to restructuring activities in fiscal 2016 compared with store asset impairment charges of $16 million unrelated to the strategic actions in fiscal 2015;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix in fiscal 2016 of $71 million; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in bonus and marketing expense; partially offset by

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a gain from insurance proceeds of $73 million related to the Fishkill fire, representing the excess over the loss on inventory; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• higher income from revenue sharing payments from Synchrony.

Interest Expense

Interest expense $ 74 $ 75 $ 59

Interest expense for fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily includes interest on overall borrowings and obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion long-term debt.
Interest expense for fiscal 2015 includes $74 million of interest on overall borrowings and obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion long-term debt, offset by a reversal of $15 million of interest expense primarily resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling and actions of foreign tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters in fiscal 2015.

Income Taxes

------------------ ----------- --- ---- ---- - --- ---- - - ---

($ in millions) Fiscal Year
 2017 2016 2015
Income taxes $ 576 $ 448 $ 551
Effective tax rate 40.4 % 39.9 % 37.5 %

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA resulted in a one-time transition tax, payable over eight years without interest or penalties, on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for income held in foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
We have calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the TCJA in our income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $57 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the TCJA, partially offset by the recognition of certain tax benefits associated with legal structure changes.
The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the impact of restructuring costs incurred in certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company was not able to recognize any tax benefit and the impact of a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix. The increase was partially offset by the recognition of certain foreign tax benefits associated with a legal structure realignment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we may have dividend payments, debt repayments, and share repurchases.
We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

------------------------- ---------------- ----- ---------------- ------ ---------------- ----- ------ - -----

($ in millions) February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016
Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,783 $ 1,783 $ 1,370
Debt $ 1,249 $ 1,313 $ 1,731
Working capital $ 2,107 $ 1,862 $ 1,450
Current ratio 1.86:1 1.76:1 1.57:1

As of February 3, 2018, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held in the United States and is generally accessible without any limitations.
In October 2015, the Company entered into a $400 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan"), which was fully repaid in January 2017.
In January 2014, the Company entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured term loan ("Japan Term Loan"), which was fully repaid in June 2017.

25

We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives, planned capital expenditures, and repayment of debt, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility or other available market instruments.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 decreased $339 million compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the following:
Net income

- ------------------------------------------
• an increase of $172 million in net income.

Non-cash items

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $79 million in store asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 in part due to restructuring activities in fiscal 2016; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $71 million due to a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix during fiscal 2016.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $236 million related to accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $188 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to the volume and timing of receipts; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $71 million related to income taxes payable, net of prepaid and other tax-related items, primarily due to the timing of tax payments, partially offset by an increase in estimated current expense in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016; partially offset by

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $115 million related to the recognition of deferred tax expense in fiscal 2017 compared with deferred tax benefit in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the deferred tax impact of federal tax reform and favorable current year temporary differences.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 increased $125 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the following:
Net income

- -----------------------------------------
• a decrease of $244 million in net income.

Non-cash items

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $246 million related to non-cash and other items primarily due to the lower gain reclassified into income related to our derivative financial instruments in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix of $71 million during fiscal 2016, and an increase of $53 million related to store asset impairment; partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $155 million related to deferred income taxes driven by fluctuations in book versus tax temporary differences for bonus accruals, depreciation, and share-based compensation.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $193 million related to accounts payable primarily due to the timing of merchandise and lease payments;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $117 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to bonus accruals; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $52 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to the volume and timing of receipts; partially offset by

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $79 million related to other current assets and other long-term assets in part due to the insurance claim receivable from the Fishkill fire.

We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations, combined with the calendar shift of weeks in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

26

Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 increased $139 million compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $207 million increase for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily related to the rebuilding of the Company's Fishkill, New York distribution center campus; partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $66 million related to insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment in fiscal 2017 primarily related to the Fishkill fire compared with no insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment in fiscal 2016.

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 decreased $201 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to less property and equipment purchases.
In fiscal 2017, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $731 million primarily related to investments in stores, information technology, and supply chain, including costs associated with the rebuilding of the company's Fishkill, New York distribution center campus.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017 decreased $46 million compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $67 million related to the final repayment of the Japan term loan in full in June 2017 compared with a $421 million payment of debt in fiscal 2016; partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $315 million of cash used for repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2017 compared with no repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2016.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 decreased $213 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• no repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2016 compared with $1 billion cash outflow related to repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2015; partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• no debt issuances in fiscal 2016 compared with the issuance of $400 million in debt in fiscal 2015; and

- -----------------------------------------------------
• the repayment of $400 million in debt in fiscal 2016.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result. Free cash flow for fiscal 2017 is further adjusted for insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment, as our cash used for purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2017 includes certain capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Company-owned distribution center which was impacted by the Fishkill fire.
The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP financial measure.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.
Our significant accounting policies can be found under the heading "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory
We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors), and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCNRV adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.

29

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets
We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group for our retail stores is reviewed for impairment primarily at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $28 million, $107 million, and $54 million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to store assets, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The amendments simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under the ASU, the impairment test is simply the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies to all reporting units (including those with zero or negative carrying amounts).
In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we recorded $99 million and $81 million of goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment using the applicable reporting unit, which is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges. We determined that the respective fair value of goodwill attributed to Athleta and Intermix significantly exceeded their respective carrying amount as of the date of our annual impairment review.

30

In fiscal 2016, the Company performed the goodwill impairment test under the previous FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other as the annual impairment test was performed prior to January 1, 2017. At the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, given the information available at the time of those assessments, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated any impairment for goodwill related to Intermix. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management updated the fiscal 2017 budget and financial projections beyond fiscal 2017 for Intermix. There were several factors that caused the financial projections and estimates to significantly decrease from the previous estimates, which included: poor fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 holiday performance at Intermix stores, the decision to reduce expected future store openings, the approval of additional store closures in fiscal 2017, and the budgeting of additional headcount required to support increased focus on the online business. These factors arising during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 had a significant and negative impact on the estimated fair value of the Intermix reporting unit, and we determined that the Intermix reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the date of our annual impairment review. As such, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge of $71 million for goodwill related to Intermix in fiscal 2016. This impairment charge reduced the $81 million of purchase price allocated to goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Intermix in December 2012 to $10 million as of January 28, 2017.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in fiscal 2015.
As of February 3, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of trade names was $95 million, which primarily consisted of $54 million and $38 million related to Athleta and Intermix, respectively. A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade names, and we did not recognize any impairment charges.
These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.
If actual store and online results and brand performance, real estate market conditions, and economic conditions including interest rates are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in our calculations, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material.

Revenue Recognition
While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For sales transacted at stores, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales where we ship the merchandise to the customer from a distribution center or store, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise.
We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisee’s predesignated turnover point. We also receive royalties from franchisees primarily based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized primarily when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee.
We record an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return allowance. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.

31

See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and expected impact from the adoption of new standards.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers
Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”). Based on historical redemption patterns, we determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote, which is three years after issuance. Breakage income, which has been historically immaterial, is recorded in other income which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When breakage income is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Substantially all of our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers have no expiration dates.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual pattern of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers changes significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage in the past three fiscal years. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and expected impact on recognition of breakage income from the adoption of new standards.

Income Taxes
We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.
At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

[" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory
We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors), and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCNRV adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets
We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group for our retail stores is reviewed for impairment primarily at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $28 million, $107 million, and $54 million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to store assets, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The amendments simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under the ASU, the impairment test is simply the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies to all reporting units (including those with zero or negative carrying amounts).
In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we recorded $99 million and $81 million of goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment using the applicable reporting unit, which is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges. We determined that the respective fair value of goodwill attributed to Athleta and Intermix significantly exceeded their respective carrying amount as of the date of our annual impairment review.

In fiscal 2016, the Company performed the goodwill impairment test under the previous FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other as the annual impairment test was performed prior to January 1, 2017. At the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, given the information available at the time of those assessments, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated any impairment for goodwill related to Intermix. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management updated the fiscal 2017 budget and financial projections beyond fiscal 2017 for Intermix. There were several factors that caused the financial projections and estimates to significantly decrease from the previous estimates, which included: poor fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 holiday performance at Intermix stores, the decision to reduce expected future store openings, the approval of additional store closures in fiscal 2017, and the budgeting of additional headcount required to support increased focus on the online business. These factors arising during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 had a significant and negative impact on the estimated fair value of the Intermix reporting unit, and we determined that the Intermix reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the date of our annual impairment review. As such, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge December 2012 to $10 million as of January 28, 2017.
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in fiscal 2015.
As of February 3, 2018, the aggregate carrying value of trade names was $95 million, which primarily consisted of $54 million and $38 million related to Athleta and Intermix, respectively. A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade names, and we did not recognize any impairment charges.
These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.
If actual store and online results and brand performance, real estate market conditions, and economic conditions including interest rates are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in our calculations, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material.

Revenue Recognition

For sales where we ship the merchandise to the customer from a distribution center or store, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise.
