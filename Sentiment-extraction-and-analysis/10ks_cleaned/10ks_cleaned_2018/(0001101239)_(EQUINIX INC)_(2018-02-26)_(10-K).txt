In February 2018, as more fully described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Infomart Dallas, including its operations and tenants, from ASB Real Estate Investments. At the closing, we will deliver $31.0 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and will issue $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. We will account for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.
In December 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the Metronode group of companies, for a cash purchase price of A$1.035 billion, or approximately $791.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on December 15, 2017. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. We will account for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.
In December 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due February 1, 2026 (the "2026 Euro Senior Notes"), or approximately $1,179.0 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on December 12, 2017, and recorded debt issuance costs of $15.7 million. We also entered into a credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3,000.0 million ("Senior Credit Facility"), comprised of a $2,000.0 million senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility ("Revolving Facility") and an approximately $1,000.0 million senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility, with maturity date of December 12, 2022 ("Term Loan Facility"). We borrowed £500.0 million and SEK 2,800.0 million under the term loan facility on December 12, 2017, or approximately $997.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. With the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Euro Senior Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, we terminated and prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility we entered in 2014 (the "2014 Senior Credit Facility"). As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $22.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.
In October 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired Itconic, with 5 data centers in Spain and Portugal, for a cash purchase price of approximately €220.5 million, or $259.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on October 9, 2017 (the "Itconic Acquisition"). The Itconic Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.

In October 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired the Zenium data center business in Istanbul for a cash purchase price of approximately $92.0 million. The acquired data center will be renamed as the Istanbul 2 (or "IS2") data center. The acquisition of the Zenium data center will be accounted for using the acquisition method. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.
In September 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,199.7 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on September 20, 2017, in aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due October 1, 2025 (the "2025 Euro Senior Notes") and recorded debt issuance costs of $16.3 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2025 Euro Senior Notes to redeem our 4.875% senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million in September 2017. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $14.6 million during the third quarter of 2017.
In August 2017, as more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we launched the ATM program, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750.0 million from time to time through our sales agents. Through December 31, 2017, we have sold 763,201 shares of common stock under the ATM program for net proceeds of approximately $355.1 million.
In August 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to our then existing 2014 Senior Credit Facility, where we modified various terms of interest rates applicable to loans borrowed under the Term Loan B Facility and Term B-2 Loan. We terminated and prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under our 2014 Senior Credit Facility in December 2017.
In May 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of certain colocation business from Verizon consisting of 29 data center buildings located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia, for a cash purchase price of approximately $3.6 billion, which we funded with proceeds of debt and equity financings conducted in January and March 2017 as discussed below. The Verizon Data Center Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are currently being appraised by a third-party and have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.
In March 2017, as more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued and sold 6,069,444 shares of our common stock in a public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $2,126.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
In March 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued $1,250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due May 15, 2027 (the "2027 Senior Notes") and recorded debt issuance costs of $16.8 million.
In February 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired IO UK's data center operating business for a cash payment of approximately $36.3 million. The acquired facility was renamed as the London 10 ("LD10") data center. The IO Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. As of December 31, 2017, we have finalized the allocation of purchase price for the IO Acquisition from the provisional amounts reported as of March 31, 2017.
In January 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we borrowed the full amount of the Term B-2 Loan of €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,059.8 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017. We prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under our Term B-2 Loan in December 2017.

Overview
Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets.

Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Our data centers in 48 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.

Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 24 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance, network choice and a highly scalable set of offerings.
Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rates were approximately 80%, excluding the Verizon Data Center, Paris IBX Data Center, Itconic, Zenium data center and IO acquisitions, as of December 31, 2017, and 81%, excluding the acquisitions of Telecity Group and Bit-isle, as of December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months and acquisitions mentioned above, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of December 31, 2017. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.
Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.
Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 37%, 36% and 34%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once,

43

Table of Contents

upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period the customer is expected to benefit from the installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally recognized as the termination occurs, when no remaining related performance obligations exist and the customer is deemed to be creditworthy, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.
The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.
We expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. We may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.
Taxation as a REIT
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2017, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada and Japan, and the data center operations in Europe with the exception of Bulgaria, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries.
As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former

TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs’ operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.
On March 22, June 21, September 20, and December 13, 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.00 per share. We expected these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the taxable income that we recognized in 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") which contains many significant changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws. The TCJA retains the REIT regime, but contains many significant changes which impact REIT, particularly those with global operations. We are still analyzing the new tax legislation and assessing its impact. Based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe we can continue to meet all the REIT compliance requirements in the foreseeable future.
We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.

Results of Operations
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the results of operations of the IO Acquisition from February 3, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition from May 1, 2017, the Zenium data center acquisition from October 6, 2017 and the Itconic Acquisition from October 9, 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the results of operations of TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016 and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition from August 1, 2016.

Americas Revenues. Revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $359.1 million of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% and 92%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Excluding revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $34.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, New York, Sao Paulo, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $11.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016 using average exchange rates.
EMEA Revenues.  As compared to 2016, revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $47.2 million of incremental revenues from recently closed acquisitions including the TelecityGroup Acquisition, which closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented 30% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $62.3 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Asia-Pacific Revenues.  Our revenues from Japan, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 34% and 35%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $42.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Osaka and Sydney metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen

Americas Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $177.4 million of costs of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. Excluding the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, depreciation expense was $273.0 million and $241.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (i) $30.4 million of higher utilities, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth, and (ii) $13.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (1,114 Americas cost of revenues employees, excluding the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 1,023 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to expand our business, including results from the newly acquired business from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA Cost of Revenues. As compared to 2016, cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $36.7 million of incremental cost of revenues attributable to recently closed acquisitions, including the TelecityGroup Acquisition that closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition that closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $25.5 million of higher utilities in support of our business growth, (ii) $16.4 million of higher other cost of sales, including third party and managed service expenses, (iii) $10.7 million of higher depreciation expense and (iv) $7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (743 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2017 versus 623 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisitions.
Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, bandwidth cost, custom service orders and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $3.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (828 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 787 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in depreciation and accretion expenses. During the year ended

December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $5.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in 2017. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.
Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas 16% 14%
EMEA 11% 12%
Asia-Pacific 9% 9%
Total 13% 12%

Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $75.3 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) $33.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (608 Americas sales and marketing employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as December 31, 2017, versus 553 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) $4.1 million of higher consulting expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the EMEA sales and marketing expense was primarily due to (i) $12.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (378 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 349 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) an increase of $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to acquisitions made during the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts.
Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and a larger average headcount in 2017 as compared to 2016 and (ii) $3.2 million of higher rent expense in support of our growth. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts.

EMEA 15% 19%
Asia-Pacific 9% 10%
Total 17% 19%

Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $35.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (1,207 Americas general and administrative employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 934 as of December 31, 2016), (ii) $22.9 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems, including revenue, data management and cloud exchange systems, to improve our quote to order and billing processes and to support the integration and growth of our business and (iii) $16.6 million of higher office expense and consulting cost to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our REIT qualification. We also expect our Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of lower amortization expenses as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and (ii) $8.4 million of lower consulting expenses which was largely due to the completion of TelecityGroup integration activities in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.
Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (453 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 358 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in rent, repair and maintenance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support our growth.
Acquisition Costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, of which $28.5 million was related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition during the year

Table of Contents

ended December 31, 2017 attributable to the Americas region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily in the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center, and to a lesser degree, to the Americas region.
Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

------------ ------------------------ ------- -------- --- ---- ------- - ------- ------ ----------------- --- ---

 Years Ended December 31, % Change
 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant Currency
Americas $ 363,220 45% $ 352,180 57% 3% 3%
EMEA 237,854 29% 124,853 20% 91% 85%

Total $ 809,014 100% $ 618,739 100% 31% 30%

Americas Income from Continuing Operations. Our Americas income from continuing operations did not change significantly year over year. While revenues increased as described above, this was largely offset by (i) an increase of $18.6 million in acquisition costs, which was primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) additional amortization of the acquired intangible assets resulted from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (iii) higher cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and lower acquisition costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred $9.2 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.5 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to our acquisition of TelecityGroup. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2016.
Interest Income. Interest income was $13.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was driven by higher cash balances and interest yield rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.64% versus 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased to $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Term B-2 Loan borrowings of €1.0 billion and the issuance of $1.25 billion of 2027 Senior Notes in March 2017, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $22.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. We expect to incur higher interest expense going forward in connection with the additional indebtedness that we incurred during 2017.

Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other income of $9.2 million and net expense of $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, including $63.5 million in foreign currency losses recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of completing the acquisition of TelecityGroup.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020, (ii) $13.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the Term B-2 Loan, (iii) $9.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the Term B Loans, (iv) $16.7 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and other financing obligations related to built-to-suite arrangements and (v) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings.
Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and lower amount of non-deductible expenses within our EMEA operations. This is partially offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the U.S. TRS due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Total $ 2,052,041 100 % $ 1,657,474 100 % 24 % 24 %

Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the U.S. dollar being generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.1 million of net favorable

Americas Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 92% and 93%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $28.9 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $6.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA Revenues.  Revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. After our acquisition of TelecityGroup, the U.K. continues to be our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, providing 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 37% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, (ii) approximately $49.7 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $33.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues

Asia-Pacific Revenues.  Revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. After our acquisition of Bit-isle, Japan is our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, providing 35% of regional revenues including Bit-isle for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding revenues attributable to Bit-isle, our revenues from Singapore, which was our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region before we acquired Bit-isle, represented approximately 38% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, (ii) approximately $58.2 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $241.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (i) $22.9 million of higher utilities, rent and facilities costs, office expense, consulting, and repairs and maintenance in support of our business growth, (ii) $10.1 million of higher costs primarily due to custom service orders in support of our revenue growth and (iii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $273.5 million of cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, EMEA cost of revenues was $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, was $100.8 million and $97.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the remaining increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher utilities,

consulting, and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth, (ii) $4.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (623 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 541 as of December 31, 2015), (iii) $8.3 million of other costs primarily related to the impact from cash flow hedges, offset by $4.0 million of lower rent and facilities costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.6 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Asia-Pacific region included $116.0 million and $17.4 million of cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $350.6 million for Asia-Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding Bit-isle, was $149.5 million and $116.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Bit-isle, the remaining increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $26.0 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, custom service orders, repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (431 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 390 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (553 Americas sales and marketing employees as December 31, 2016 versus 497 as of December 31, 2015) and (ii) $7.9 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting and travel expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $53.0 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses were $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (283 EMEA sales and marketing employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 227 as of December 31, 2015), and (ii) $4.0 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting, and other marketing expenses to support our growth. During the year ended

December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $15.6 million and $2.2 million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to $4.9 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (205 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 183 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015.
General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.5 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems to improve our quote to order and billing processes and other systems to support the integration and growth of our business, (ii) $16.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (934 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 800 as of December 31, 2015) and (iii) $10.7 million of higher office expense, rent and facility cost and outside services consulting costs also in line with our overall growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $92.7 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, our EMEA general and administrative expenses were $135.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the increase was primarily due to (i) $22.8 million of higher consulting services, travel, office and rent and facility costs to support the integration of TelecityGroup and (ii) $18.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (562 EMEA general and administrative employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 420 as of December 31, 2015). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in EMEA general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $43.9 million associated with the TelecityGroup acquired intangibles.

Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $17.4 million and $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, the increase was primarily due to $8.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (317 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 266 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015.
Acquisition Costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $41.7 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region, and to a lesser degree, to the Asia-Pacific region.
Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

------------ ------------------------ ------- -------- --- ---- ------- - ------- ------ ----------------- ----- ---

 Years Ended December 31, % Change
 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant Currency
Americas $ 352,180 57% $ 324,458 57% 9% 9%

Total $ 618,739 100% $ 567,342 100% 9% 10%

Americas Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Americas income from continuing operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above as well as the gain recognized on the sale of the San Jose land parcel, partially offset by higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The decrease in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, as well as the increased depreciation and amortization created from the purchase accounting for TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the LD2 data center. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our acquisition and integration of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by the impairment charges, higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle as well as higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015.

Interest Income. Interest income was $3.5 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 0.37% versus 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased to $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.1 billion of senior notes issued in December 2015, $614.7 million outstanding in seven-year term loans we borrowed in January 2016 and $406.6 million outstanding in five-year term loans we borrowed in October 2016, replacing a bridge term loan facility we borrowed to finance our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by the settlement of the 4.75% convertible debt in June 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $13.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we borrowed the €1.0 billion Term B-2 Loan in January 2017. We also expect to incur additional indebtedness to support our growth and acquisition opportunities including the Verizon Asset Purchase, resulting in higher interest expense going forward.
Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other expense of $57.9 million and $60.6 million for the years December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses during the periods.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in December 2015.
Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $45.5 million and $23.2 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 28.4% and 11.0%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to higher profits in the domestic TRS and larger amount of non-deductible interest expenses within our EMEA operations.
We recorded excess income tax benefits of $2.8 million and $30.0 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

------------ ------------------------ --------- -------- --- ---- ------- - --------- ------ ----------------- --- ---

 Years Ended December 31, % Change
 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant Currency
Americas $ 787,311 47% $ 698,604 55% 13% 13%

Asia-Pacific 375,900 23% 254,462 20% 48% 46%
Total $ 1,657,474 100% $ 1,271,627 100% 30% 31%

Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
 EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our EMEA region includes $189.0 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the decrease in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher operating costs as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and integration costs relating to TelecityGroup acquisition. During the year ended

Table of Contents

December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our Asia-Pacific region includes $50.3 million and $5.2 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to Bit-isle, the increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $4.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.
Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations.
In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly

based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ --------- ---- ------- ---- --------- ------- - ---------

 Years Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Income from operations $ 809,014 $ 618,739 $ 567,342
Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense 1,028,892 843,510 528,929
Stock-based compensation expense 175,500 156,148 133,633
Acquisition costs 38,635 64,195 41,723
Impairment charges — 7,698 —
Gain on asset sales — (32,816 ) —
Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,052,041 $ 1,657,474 $ 1,271,627

Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "Results of Operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in "Overview".
Funds from Operations ("FFO") and AFFO
We use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items.
We use AFFO to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis and as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses beginning in 2015 and vesting of restricted stock units that were granted beginning in 2015 and that have both service and performance conditions. In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The adjustments for both installation revenue and straight-line rent expense are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period’s operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.

Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "Results of Operations," as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in "Overview."
Constant Currency Presentation
Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $10.2 billion consisting of (a) approximately $7,002.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,699.0 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c) $1,468.3 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).
We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,450.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $929.3 million was held in the U.S. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2,000.0 million Revolving Facility and the ATM program described below. On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Verizon's colocation data centers and their operations located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia for a cash purchase price of approximately $3,594.7 million. The Verizon Data Center Acquisition was funded by the borrowing of our then existing €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan and proceeds from the issuance of our $1,250.0 million 2027 Senior Notes and the issuance of common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we borrowed the full amount of our €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), issued $1,250.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2027 (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and sold 6,069,444 shares of common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of $2,126.3 million (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
In August 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to sell up to $750.0 million of common stock in at the market ("ATM") offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 763,201 shares for approximately $355.1 million, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and estimated equity offering costs under the ATM program.
In September 2017, we issued €1,000.0 million 2025 Euro Senior Notes and redeemed the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020. In December 2017, we issued €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes and entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $3,000.0 million Senior Credit Facility, comprised of a $2,000.0 million Revolving Facility and approximately a $1,000.0 million Term Loan Facility. We borrowed £500.0 million and SEK 2,800.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on December 12, 2017, or approximately $997.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. Using the proceeds borrowed from the Term Loan Facility and the €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes and cash on hand, we terminated and repaid in full amounts outstanding under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 41 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $62.6 million issued and outstanding under the Revolving Facility; as a result of these letters of credit, we had a total of approximately $1,937.4 million of additional liquidity available to us under the Revolving Facility. Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.
We completed our conversion to a REIT in 2014 and began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2015. As a result of our conversion to a REIT, we made special distributions to our stockholders in 2015 and 2014. The distributions were payable in common stock or cash at the election of our stockholders, with the cash portion of the distributions subject to certain maximum amounts. As a result of the special distributions, we paid a total of $125.5 million in 2015 and $83.3 million in 2014 and distributed 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Also as a result of our conversion to a REIT, we began paying quarterly dividends in 2015. We paid an aggregate of $621.5 million and $499.5 million of quarterly cash dividends during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $521.5 million of quarterly cash dividends and special distribution during 2015.

 (in thousands)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,439,233 $ 1,019,353 $ 894,823
Net cash used in investing activities (5,400,826 ) (2,045,668 ) (637,797 )
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,607,860 (897,065 ) 1,873,152

Operating Activities
Our cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary use of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and other acquisitions in 2017, offset by timing of collections on our receivables and increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisition of TelecityGroup in January 2016 and inclusion of full year operating results of Bit-isle.
Investing Activities
The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $2,196.7 million, primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, a decrease in proceeds from asset sales of $803.8 million, $265.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $67.0 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in spending for the acquisitions of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center of $1,521.4 million, net of cash acquired, over prior year acquisition spending, a decrease in sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of $503.3 million and $245.2 million of higher capital expenditures, primarily a result of expansion activity. This was partially offset by proceeds from sales of assets of $851.6 million, net of cash transferred.
During 2018, we expect to complete the acquisitions of Metronode and the Infomart Dallas. We also anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will increase from our 2017 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under our €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan, approximately $1,059.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017, (ii) the issuance of $1,250.0 million 2027 Senior Notes, (iii) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2025 Euro Senior Notes, approximately $1,199.7 million at the exchange rate on September 20, 2017, (iv) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes, approximately $1,179.0 million at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017, (v) borrowings under our Term Loan Facility of approximately $997.1 million on December 12, 2017, at the exchange rate in effect on that day, (vi) the sale of common stock for net proceeds of $2,481.4 million and (vii) proceeds from employee awards of $41.7 million, partially offset by (i) repayment of the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (ii) repayment in full of amounts outstanding under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility of approximately $2,207.7 million in total at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017, (iii) dividend distributions of $621.5 million, (iv) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $93.5 million and (v) debt issuance costs of $81.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the TelecityGroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility, (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by (iv) $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our Term Loan B and Japanese Yen Term Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily due to (i) $1,100.0 million of gross proceeds from the senior notes offering in December 2015, (ii) $829.5 million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in November 2015, (iii) $1,197.1 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan modification, our bridge term loan and our revolving credit facility, partially offset by (iv) $715.3 million repayment of mortgage and loans payable including repayment of $171.2 million of loans assumed in the Bit-isle acquisition and repayment of $544.1 million of U.S. dollar-denominated term loan and other mortgage and loan payments, (v) $396.0 million of quarterly dividend distributions and (vi) $125.5 million of special distributions. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment and refinancing

of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures, and the payment of our regular cash dividends.
Debt Obligations
Debt Facilities
We have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2027 under which a total principal balance of $8,470.3 million remained outstanding (gross of debt issuance cost and discounts) as of December 31, 2017. For further information on debt obligations, see "Debt Facilities" in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations
We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1,699.0 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2017 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.86%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see "Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations" in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 41 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $62.6 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.
We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $57.5 million as of December 31, 2017. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.
Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2017, we were contractually committed for $508.2 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers

We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2017, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2018 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2017, which total $643.6 million, are also reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
On October 13, 2017, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain real property in Sydney, Australia, for a purchase price of A$110.0 million or approximately $86.7 million, subject to certain closing conditions, which is not reflected in the table above. We expect to close this transaction in 2018.
In December 2017, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the Metronode half of 2018, subject to certain closing conditions, which is not reflected in the table above.
Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2017, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see "Guarantor Arrangements" in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:

- ----------------------------
• Accounting for income taxes;

- -------------------------------------
• Accounting for business combinations;

- ------------------------------------------
• Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and

- ---------------------------------------------
• Accounting for property, plant and equipment.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $186.3 million and $212.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total valuation allowance of $84.6 million and $29.2 million, respectively. If and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it may have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the futureDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided full and partial valuation allowances on the Spanish and Turkish deferred tax assets acquired from the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, respectively. In addition, we set up a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with tax goodwill obtained as a result of a reorganization in Brazil. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we decided to release the valuation allowances related to the historical data center operations in Japan. This reduction in valuation allowance was partially offset by the full valuation allowance setups in Brazil and Canada as well as the increase in valuation allowances in Europe due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $82.4 million and $72.2 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $10.2 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup integrations which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company’s tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $41.4 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. The unrecognized tax benefits of $82.4 million as of December 31, 2017, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgment used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the Itconic Acquisition in October, 2017, Zenium data center acquisition in October, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in May, 2017, IO Acquisition in February, 2017, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition in August 2016, TelecityGroup acquisition in January 2016, Bit-isle acquisition in November 2015, and Nimbo acquisition in January 2015. In 2017, we have finalized the purchase price allocation for the Paris IBX Data Center and IO acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters, respectively. The purchase price allocation for the TelecityGroup and Bit-isle acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net intangible assets of $2.4 billion, $719.2 million and $224.6 million, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $177.0 million, $122.9 million and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2018 or beyond.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. If goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform step two of goodwill impairment test. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In 2017, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, this analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. In 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we used both the income and market approach. The income approach is based on the ten-year business plan. We apply the weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. The market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. In 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2016 or 2017 that indicated a significant potential impairment. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $1.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $239.4 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.4 billion. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment, establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had property, plant and equipment of $9.4 billion, $7.2 billion, and $5.6 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded depreciation expense of $865.5 million, $714.3 million, and $498.1 million, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We recorded accumulated depreciation for assets under capital leases and other financing obligations of $348.4 million, $283.7 million and $221.8 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded rent expense of $157.9 million, $140.6 million, and $101.5 million under operating leases.

Constant Currency Presentation
Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $10.2 billion consisting of (a) approximately $7,002.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,699.0 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c) $1,468.3 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).
We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,450.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $929.3 million was held in the U.S. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2,000.0 million Revolving Facility and the ATM program described below.

[") which contains many significant changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws. The TCJA retains the REIT regime, but contains many significant changes which impact REIT, particularly those with global operations. We are still analyzing the new tax legislation and assessing its impact. Based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe we can continue to meet all the REIT compliance requirements in the foreseeable future.
We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.

Americas Revenues. Revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $359.1 million of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% and 92%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Excluding revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $34.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, New York, Sao Paulo, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $11.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016 using average exchange rates.
EMEA Revenues.  As compared to 2016, revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $47.2 million of incremental revenues from recently closed acquisitions including the TelecityGroup Acquisition, which closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented 30% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $62.3 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Asia-Pacific Revenues.  Our revenues from Japan, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 34% and 35%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $42.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Osaka and Sydney metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen

Americas Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $177.4 million of costs of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. Excluding the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, depreciation expense was $273.0 million and $241.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (i) $30.4 million of higher utilities, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth, and (ii) $13.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (1,114 Americas cost of revenues employees, excluding the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 1,023 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to expand our business, including results from the newly acquired business from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA Cost of Revenues. As compared to 2016, cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $36.7 million of incremental cost of revenues attributable to recently closed acquisitions, including the TelecityGroup Acquisition that closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition that closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $25.5 million of higher utilities in support of our business growth, (ii) $16.4 million of higher other cost of sales, including third party and managed service expenses, (iii) $10.7 million of higher depreciation expense and (iv) $7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (743 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2017 versus 623 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisitions.
Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, bandwidth cost, custom service orders and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $3.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (828 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 787 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in depreciation and accretion expenses. During the year ended

December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $5.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in 2017. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.
Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

Americas 16% 14%
EMEA 11% 12%

Total 13% 12%

Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $75.3 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) $33.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (608 Americas sales and marketing employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as December 31, 2017, versus 553 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) $4.1 million of higher consulting expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the EMEA sales and marketing expense was primarily due to (i) $12.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (378 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 349 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) an increase of $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to acquisitions made during the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts.
Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and a larger average headcount in 2017 as compared to 2016 and (ii) $3.2 million of higher rent expense in support of our growth. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts.

Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $35.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (1,207 Americas general and administrative employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 934 as of December 31, 2016), (ii) $22.9 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems, including revenue, data management and cloud exchange systems, to improve our quote to order and billing processes and to support the integration and growth of our business and (iii) $16.6 million of higher office expense and consulting cost to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our REIT qualification. We also expect our Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.
EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of lower amortization expenses as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and (ii) $8.4 million of lower consulting expenses which was largely due to the completion of TelecityGroup integration activities in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.
Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (453 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 358 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in rent, repair and maintenance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support our growth.
Acquisition Costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, of which $28.5 million was related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition during the year

ended December 31, 2017 attributable to the Americas region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily in the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center, and to a lesser degree, to the Americas region.
Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Americas Income from Continuing Operations. Our Americas income from continuing operations did not change significantly year over year. While revenues increased as described above, this was largely offset by (i) an increase of $18.6 million in acquisition costs, which was primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) additional amortization of the acquired intangible assets resulted from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (iii) higher cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and lower acquisition costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred $9.2 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.5 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to our acquisition of TelecityGroup. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2016.
Interest Income. Interest income was $13.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was driven by higher cash balances and interest yield rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.64% versus 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased to $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Term B-2 Loan borrowings of €1.0 billion and the issuance of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $22.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. We expect to incur higher interest expense going forward in connection with the additional indebtedness that we incurred during 2017.

Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other income of $9.2 million and net expense of $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, including $63.5 million in foreign currency losses recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of completing the acquisition of TelecityGroup.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020, (ii) $13.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the Term B-2 Loan, (iii) $9.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the Term B Loans, (iv) $16.7 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and other financing obligations related to built-to-suite arrangements and (v) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings.
Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. operations of our REIT and QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the U.S. TRS due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales.

Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
 EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our EMEA region includes $189.0 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the decrease in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher operating costs as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and integration costs relating to TelecityGroup acquisition.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $4.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.
Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:

- ----------------------------
• Accounting for income taxes;

- -------------------------------------
• Accounting for business combinations;

- ------------------------------------------
• Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and

- ---------------------------------------------
• Accounting for property, plant and equipment.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences historical data center operations in Japan. This reduction in valuation allowance was partially offset by the full valuation allowance setups in Brazil and Canada as well as the increase in valuation of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $10.2 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup integrations which was partially offset recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.

We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2018 or beyond.
