Business Transformation

Stericycle is focused on driving long-term growth, profitability and delivering enhanced shareholder value.  As part of our business strategy, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear Business Transformation with the objective to improve long-term operational and financial performance.  The Business Transformation is based on a strategic vision to build a best-in-class enterprise performance management (“EPM”) operating model to enable the Company to operate more efficiently, provide an enhanced experience to customers, better capitalize on future growth opportunities and establish greater controls and oversight to drive more consistent results.  Additionally, a key component to the Business Transformation is the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system which will

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 33

Part II

leverage standard processes throughout the organization to accelerate decision making, expedite acquisition integration, remediate compliance and control issues, and enable real-time analytics.

Key initiatives of the Business Transformation include:

 • Portfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets.

 • Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities.

 • Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model.

 • Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management process, and expanding customer self-service options.

 • Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale.

As part of the Business Transformation, the Company expects to record approximately $275 million to $300 million in expenses and capital expenditures over five years.

Business Transformation costs include the following types of activities:

 • Employee termination,

 • Asset impairment,

 • Consulting and professional services including system integration, project management, ERP advisory, and information technology related costs,

 • Internal resources, including project related incentive compensation, and

 • Other related expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $31.3 million in costs related to the Business Transformation, which included $16.4 million for consulting and professional services primarily related to business case development, execution and governance, $10.8 million for employee termination, $2.4 million non-cash impairment of long-lived assets, $1.0 million of other related expenses which are reflected as part of Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) on the Consolidated Statements of Income, and $0.7 million for employee termination which is reflected as part of Cost of revenues (“COR”) on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, we capitalized $10.9 million of licenses for the ERP system, which is classified within Property, plant and equipment (Construction in progress) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intangible Amortization

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded $118.4 million, $129.3 million, and $45.5 million, respectively, of intangible amortization expense from acquisitions.

Acquisition and Integration

We have proven that acquisitions are a steady and efficient way to scale operations, build critical customer density for transportation and treatment operations, and enter new markets or geographies, as

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 34

Part II

well as provide opportunity to introduce our additional services to the acquired customers.  In our early history, acquisitions were a key strategy to rapidly building our customer base and route density in the United States.  We have been able to expand internationally through acquisition and now operate in 20 different markets outside the U.S.  Over our history, Stericycle has completed 496 acquisitions, with 271 in the United States and 225 internationally.  We expect to continue our acquisition strategy, remaining focused on small, highly accretive, tuck in acquisitions that broaden our various service capabilities while creating value for our shareholders.

The following table summarizes the locations and services of our acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:

Our acquisition and integration costs include the following types of activities:

 • Consulting and professional services incurred in connection with the identification, valuation, due diligence, and execution of an acquisition or potential acquisition, and acquisition internal resources,

 • Consulting and professional services incurred in connection with integrating newly acquired businesses, which may include the integration of the sales or collection processes and systems, rebranding to the Company’s name, closure activities, employee termination related to personnel redundancies, contract and lease exit costs, and other integration related activities,

 • Accelerated depreciation, and

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 35

Part II

 • Change in fair value of contingent consideration.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded $40.7 million, $60.9 million, and $79.9 million, respectively, of acquisition and integration expenses which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $10.6 million acquisition expenses, $30.5 million integration expenses, and a $0.4 million favorable change in the fair value of contingent consideration.

Acquisition and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $9.6 million acquisition expenses, $53.3 million integration expense (primarily related to the fourth quarter 2015 Shred-it acquisition), and a $2.0 million favorable change in fair value of contingent consideration.

Acquisition and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $39.1 million acquisition expenses (primarily related to the fourth quarter 2015 Shred-it acquisition), $41.4 million integration expense, and a $0.6 million favorable change in fair value of contingent consideration.

The results of operations of our acquired businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of the acquisitions.  Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions are not presented because the pro forma effects, individually or in the aggregate, were not material to the Company’s results of operations.

Operational Optimization

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded $71.1 million, $59.1 million, and $34.8 million, respectively, of Operational Optimization expenses which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Plant throughput and route density are competitive strengths of Stericycle.  We maintain such strengths by making adjustments to our network of transportation and treatment facilities to optimize overall logistics and processing capabilities within a service line while reducing operational costs.  As part of these efforts, we seek to reduce network redundancies by consolidating facilities, closing the redundant facility, and restructuring the local organization and operation for efficiency.

Our Operational Optimization costs include the following types of activities:

 • Consulting and professional services,

 • Employee termination,

 • Closure activities,

 • Contract and lease exit costs,

 • Environmental and retirement obligations,

 • Impairments and accelerated depreciation, and

 • Other related expenses.

From 2015 to 2017, we closed/consolidated a number of Communications and Related Services business sites (mostly call centers), reducing them from 80 to 31.  By better leveraging technology and cross-training agents, we were able to reduce redundant facilities and resources and improve overall customer service levels.

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 36

Part II

In 2016, as a result of the Company’s evaluation and optimization of their portfolio of services, Stericycle ceased operating the patient transport business in the U.K. and exited from related contracts during 2016 and 2017.

During the first quarter of 2017, management began executing a realignment of our operations to reduce labor redundancies and facility costs in our Latin American countries.  Various operating locations, primarily in Brazil, have been consolidated to increase efficiency while reducing headcount.

As part of our optimization efforts in 2017, we incurred operating permit and long-lived asset non-cash impairment charges at our plant in Japan related to facility rationalization.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $71.1 million of Operational Optimization expenses:

 • $41.6 million in the U.S. of which $1.6 million employee termination, and $3.2 million lease exit costs related to the closure/consolidation of call centers in our Domestic Communications and Related Services business, $8.9 million non-cash impairment charges related to operating permits and rationalization of tradenames, $9.2 million consulting and professional services to reduce operational redundancies, and $18.7 million to improve efficiency such as optimizing overall logistics, and centralizing our customer service and sales functions for our secure information destructions locations.

 • $15.7 million operational optimization costs in Latin America, of which $3.2 million employee termination, $4.2 million closure and exit costs were due to rationalizing our operations, environmental matters, and $8.3 million non-cash impairment charges for long-lived assets, operating permits and customer relationships;

 • $8.8 million of charges related to facility rationalization in Japan, including $8.7 million of non-cash impairment charges for long-lived assets and operating permits; and

 • $0.5 million of employee severance charges and $4.5 million closure and exit charges for facility rationalization and contract exit charges in the U.K.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, all the charges described above were included in SG&A, except for $0.4 million which was included in COR.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $59.1 million of Operational Optimization expenses:

 • $4.5 million related to employee termination;

 • $26.5 million of charges to exit certain of our patient transport services contracts and plant conversion expense in the U.K.;

 • $16.1 million, mostly in the U.S., to improve efficiency such as optimizing overall logistics and processing capabilities for our security information destruction locations, and centralizing customer service and sales functions for our medical waste business, including $6.8 million lease exit costs related to the closure/consolidation of call centers in our Communications and Related Services business; and

 • $12.0 million of consulting and professional services to identify opportunities to reduce operational redundancies.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, all the charges described above were included in SG&A, except for $9.0 million which was in COR.

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 37

Part II

 For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $34.8 million of Operational Optimization expenses:

 • $8.6 million related to employee termination;

 • $8.1 million non-cash impairment charges for long-lived assets and intangible assets;

 • $10.2 million in the U.S. to improve efficiency, including $of 3.6 million lease exit costs related to the closure/consolidation of call centers in our Communications and Related Services business; and

 • $7.9 million of costs incurred due to plant conversion and facility rationalization in the U.K.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, all the charges described above were included in SG&A, except for $1.5 million which was included in COR.

 Divestitures

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $9.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively, of divestiture expenses which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company did not record any divestiture related expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Company evaluates their portfolio of services on an ongoing basis with a country-by-country and service line-by-service line approach to assess the long-term potential and identify potential business candidates for divestiture.  Our decision criterion for divestiture is based on:

 • outlook for long-term market conditions,

 • potential impact to complimentary services or customer relationships,

 • ability to leverage infrastructure and customer base for growth,

 • potential for margin improvement,

 • divestiture value today versus future divestiture value,

 • return on invested capital, and

 • implications for ERP.

Divestiture costs include:

 • Consulting and professional services,

 • Impairments,

 • Loss (gain) on disposal, and

 • Other related expenses.

As a result of this portfolio optimization effort, Stericycle divested a niche Manufacturing and Industrial hazardous waste business in the U.K. during 2016 and 2017.  Furthermore, in late 2017 Stericycle divested its secure information destruction business in South Africa.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $9.5 million of divestiture related expenses which included $6.8 million of non-cash asset impairment charges related to changes in the fair value of assets held for sale in the U.K., and a $5.7 million loss from the sale of certain assets and liabilities

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 38

Part II

in the U.K., partially offset by a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of our secure information destruction business in South Africa.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $27.1 million of divestiture related expense which included a $25.5 million charge on certain of our U.K. operations that were classified as assets held for sale, primarily non-cash impairment charges for customer relationships, operating permits, goodwill and long-lived assets, and a $1.6 million loss from the sale of certain assets in the U.K.

With the anticipated implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system, Stericycle will continue its strategic portfolio review with the intent of identifying additional non-strategic service lines or markets for divestiture prior to the implementation of the ERP technology platform.

Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance

We operate in highly regulated industries and must address regulatory inquiries or respond to investigations from time to time.  We are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time.  Our financial results may also include considerations of non-recurring matters including settlements, environmental remediation, and legal related consulting and professional fees which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Most notable, in 2017, the Company executed a definitive written settlement agreement (the “Settlement”) for the small quantity medical waste customer class action lawsuit that was initiated in 2013.  Under the terms of the Settlement, we will establish a common fund of $295.0 million from which will be paid all compensation to members of the settlement class, attorneys’ fees to class counsel, incentive awards to the named class representatives, and all costs of notice and administration.  Our existing contracts with customers will remain in force, while we will also establish as part of the Settlement guidelines for future price increases and provide customers additional transparency regarding such increases.  The Settlement also addresses additional matters, including the availability of alternative dispute resolution for members of the settlement class.  In the Settlement, we admitted no fault or wrongdoing whatsoever, and entered into the Settlement in order to avoid the cost and uncertainty of litigation.

In June 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued a subpoena to the Company, requesting documents and information relating to the Company’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or other foreign or domestic anti-corruption laws with respect to certain of the Company’s operations in Latin America.  In addition, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has notified the Company that it is investigating this matter in parallel with the SEC.  The Company is cooperating with these agencies. The Company is also conducting an internal investigation of these and other matters, including outside of Latin America, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the assistance of outside counsel, and this investigation has found evidence of improper conduct.  We have not accrued for any potential associated contingent liabilities as we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible losses that we may incur.  As the factual and legal issues presented in this matter are sufficiently unique, in our judgment, we are unable to make such an estimate.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $327.7 million of legal, settlement and regulatory compliance expenses, of which $295.0 million was for the Settlement and $32.7 million was for regulatory compliance, consulting and professional services, primarily related to certain non-recurring litigation matters.

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 39

Part II

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $7.2 million in regulatory compliance, consulting and professional services, primarily related to certain non-recurring litigation matters.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $59.7 million of legal, settlement and regulatory compliance expenses, of which $28.5 million related to the Qui Tam Action Settlement, $28.2 million related to the Junk Fax Lawsuit Settlement, and $3.0 million of certain non-recurring litigation matters.

Impairment

In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, we disclosed that we were in the process of completing the valuation of our reporting units with the assistance of our external valuation specialist.  At that time, we were evaluating the impact of the prolonged declining market trends in Latin America and continued softness in the Company’s Manufacturing and Industrial regional hazardous waste business.  We have experienced cost pressures in Latin America due to the strength of local competition resulting in an increasing inability to pass through inflationary price increases.  In addition, the cost savings initiatives that were anticipated in 2017 have taken longer than expected to implement and are extending into 2018.  In the fourth quarter 2017, we finalized our long rang plan (“LRP”) to reflect these challenging conditions in Latin America partially offset by incorporating the impact Business Transformation will have on our prospective results.

As a result, the Company recorded a $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Company’s Latin America reporting unit which is reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The impairment charge recognized was the amount by which the carrying value of the Latin America reporting unit exceeded its fair value.  The result of the factors described above on our LRP was an overall decline in the forecasted financial information included in our income approach valuation model.  In addition, we concluded it was appropriate to risk-adjust the discount rate used as compared to the prior year.

There were no other impairments recorded in 2017 other than those already referenced above.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a $1.4 million non-cash permit impairment charge in Japan which is reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no other impairments recorded in 2016 other than those already referenced above.

There were no other impairments recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 other than those already referenced above.

Other

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $24.8 million of consulting and professional services related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition and lease accounting standards as well as internal control remediation activities which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $8.8 million of consulting and professional services related to internal control remediation activities and implementation of the new revenue recognition standard which are reflected as part of SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded $2.5 million non-cash impairment charge, offset by a $3.1 million gain from an insurance settlement which is reflected as part of Other (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Part II

There were no other special project costs for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Capital Allocation

Stericycle has maintained a structured capital allocation strategy that balances investment in the business, debt reduction, and returns to shareholders.

Our Capital Allocation items include the following types of activities:

 • Stock issuance costs,

 • Dividends on Preferred Stock,

 • Debt modification costs in connection with related non-recurring matters,

 • Early extinguishment of debt gains and losses, and

 • Other related expenses.

Dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of 5.25% on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (and, correspondingly, $100.00 per share with respect to the depositary shares).  The dividends may be payable in cash, or subject to certain limitations, in shares of our common stock, or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2015, and to, and including, September 15, 2018.

We declared and paid dividends of $36.3 million, $39.4 million, and $10.1 million to the preferred stock shareholders during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Tax Reform

As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on its year end 2017 income tax benefit/provision and as a result has recorded $129.8 million as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017.  For further discussion, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 8 – Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues:  In analyzing our Company’s performance, it is necessary to understand that our various regulated services share a common infrastructure and customer base.  We market our regulated and compliance services by offering various pricing options to meet our customers’ preferences, and customers move between these different billing paradigms.  For example, our customers may contract with us for "Medical Waste Disposal" services that are billed based on the weight of waste collected, processed and disposed during a particular period, and in a subsequent period, the same customer could move to our standard service ("Steri-Safe OSHA Compliance Program"), which packages the same regulated medical waste services with training and education services for a contracted subscription fee.  Another example is a customer that purchases our "Medical Waste Disposal" and "Sharps Disposal Management" services which provides the customer with the same regulated services under a different pricing and billing arrangement.  We do not track the movement of customers between the various types of regulated services we offer.  Although we can identify directional trends in our services, because the regulated services are similar in nature and there are inherent inaccuracies in disaggregation, we believe that aggregating these revenues communicates the appropriate metric.  We analyze our revenue growth by identifying changes related to organic growth, acquired growth, divestitures and changes due to currency exchange fluctuations.

Consolidated revenues increased $18.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2017 to $3.58 billion from $3.56 billion in 2016.  Overall organic revenues growth contributed $20.1 million, or 0.6%.  Organic growth excludes the effect of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full year of revenues in the comparative period.  Acquisitions contributed $32.2 million to revenues.  Divestitures reduced revenues by $21.6 million.  The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a 0.3% increase in revenues in

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 42

Part II

2017.  The effect of foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted total revenues in 2017 by $12.3 million, or 0.3%, as foreign currencies declined against the U.S. dollar.

Gross profit:  Consolidated gross profit decreased $24.4 million, or 1.6%, in 2017 to $1.46 billion from $1.49 billion in 2016.  As a percentage of revenues, consolidated gross profit decreased to 40.8% in 2017 compared to 41.7% in 2016.  The decline in gross profit was primarily due to lower revenues from our Manufacturing and Industrial (“M&I”) customers, which have a higher fixed cost structure, and approximately $18.0 million of non-cash fixed assets depreciation increases and write-offs.  Domestically, pricing pressure on our small quantity regulated waste and compliance customers negatively impacted our gross profit as a percentage of revenues.  In addition, international gross profit is lower than domestic gross profit because our international operations have fewer small account customers, which tend to generate higher gross profit.  Historically, our international operations generate most of their revenues from large account customers, such as hospitals.  As our international revenues increase, consolidated gross profit percentages experience downward pressure due to this "business mix" shift, which may be offset by additional international small account market penetration, integration savings, and domestic business expansion.

SG&A:  Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $417.0 million, or 39.6%, in 2017 to $1.47 billion from $1.05 billion in 2016.  The increase was primarily attributable to: $295.0 million charge for the Settlement for the small quantity customer class action lawsuit, a $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America, $32.7 million in regulatory compliance, consulting and professional expenses, primarily related to certain non-recurring litigation matters, $30.6 million of Business Transformation related expenses, and $24.8 million of consulting and professional services related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition and lease accounting standards and internal control remediation work.  As a percentage of revenues, excluding the $295.0 million Settlement charge and the $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, SG&A increased to 31.0% in 2017 compared to 29.6% in 2016.

(Loss) income from operations:  Consolidated (loss) income from operations decreased $441.4 million, or 101.8%, in 2017 to ($7.6) million loss from $433.8 million income in 2016.  Comparison of income from operations between 2017 and 2016 was primarily driven by the items described in Gross profit and SG&A above.

Interest expense:  Net interest expense decreased in 2017 to $93.7 million from $97.8 million in 2016 due to a reduction of our average outstanding debt balance, partially offset by an increase in interest rates in the U.S.

Income tax (benefit) expense:  Income tax (benefit) was ($150.9) million in 2017 compared to income tax expense of $120.2 million in 2016.  The effective tax rates for the years 2017 and 2016 were (139.9%) and 36.6%, respectively.  The change in 2017 rate, when compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.  The Company recognized an income tax (benefit) of $(129.8) million as a result of revaluing our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the newly enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%, partially offset by a one-time transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits which we will elect to pay over an eight-year period, and expected foreign withholding taxes.

Revenues:  Domestic and Canada RCS revenues increased $43.1 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 to $2.55 billion from $2.51 billion in 2016.  Organic revenue growth contributed $19.0 million, or 0.8%, and acquisitions contributed $20.9 million, or 0.8%, to revenues.  Our Secure Information Destruction revenues were strong due to higher sales activity for both recurring and one-time purge services combined with higher recycling revenue.  The strengthening of the Canadian dollar had a favorable impact on 2017 revenues by $3.2 million, or 0.1%.  Services related to Manufacturing and Industrial (“M&I”) experienced a decline of $19.7 million from last year, which reduced overall organic growth by 0.9%.  This decline was due to fewer on-call services related to softness in the U.S. industrial market.  In addition, we have experienced pricing pressure on our small quantity regulated waste and compliance customers resulting from hospital consolidation of physician practices and increased competitive activities in the market.

Gross profit:  Domestic and Canada RCS gross profit decreased $29.6 million, or 2.6%, in 2017 to $1.09 billion from $1.12 billion in 2016.  As a percentage of revenues, gross profit decreased to 42.8% in 2017 compared to 44.7% in 2016, primarily due to lower revenues from our M&I customers, which have a higher fixed cost structure, and approximately $18.0 million of non-cash fixed assets depreciation increases and write-offs.  Pricing pressure on our small quantity regulated waste and compliance customers negatively impacted our gross profit as a percentage of revenues.  We also experienced higher costs related to wages and fuel.

SG&A:  Domestic and Canada RCS SG&A expenses increased $274.0 million, or 53.1%, in 2017 to $789.8 million from $515.8 million in 2016, primarily due to the $295.0 million charge for the Settlement for the small quantity customer class action lawsuit.  As a percentage of revenues, excluding the $295.0 million Settlement, SG&A decreased to 19.4% in 2017 compared to 20.6% in 2016.

Revenues:  International RCS revenue decreased $44.1 million, or 5.9%, in 2017 to $707.6 million from $751.7 million in 2016.  2017 organic revenue decline in the International RCS segment was $13.4 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to exiting certain patient transport service contracts in the U.K. and a decline in M&I waste services in our Latin American countries.  Acquisitions in the International RCS segment contributed $6.4 million to revenues.  Divestitures related to the sale of certain assets in the U.K. reduced revenues by $21.6 million.  The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a 2.0% decrease in revenues in 2017.  The effect of foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted international revenues in 2017 by $15.5 million, or 2.1%, as foreign currencies declined against the U.S. dollar.

Gross profit:  International RCS gross profit decreased $9.6 million, or 4.2%, in 2017 to $218.9 million from $228.5 million in 2016.  As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased to 30.9% in 2017 compared to 30.4% in 2016 as a result of divesting a lower margin patient transport business in the U.K.

SG&A:  International RCS SG&A expenses increased $39.2 million, or 15.3%, in 2017 to $296.0 million from $256.8 million in 2016, primarily due to a $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America, partially offset by the divestiture of the patient transport business in the U.K. in 2017.  As a percentage of revenues, excluding a $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America, SG&A decreased to 32.6% in 2017 compared to 34.2% in 2016.

Loss from operations:  International RCS loss from operations increased $48.8 million in 2017 to $77.1 million from $28.3 million in 2016. Comparison of loss from operations between 2017 and 2016 was primarily driven by the items described in SG&A above.

Revenues:  Other revenues, related to Domestic Communication and Related Services, increased $19.4 million, or 6.4%, in 2017 to $321.2 million from $301.8 million in 2016, primarily due to serving new brands across many industries and several larger non-recurring recall events in 2017.

Revenues:  Consolidated revenues increased $576.4 million, or 19.3%, in 2016 to $3.56 billion from $2.99 billion in 2015.  Overall organic revenue growth contributed $94.6 million, or 3.2%.  Organic growth excludes the effect of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full year of revenues in the comparative period.  Acquisitions contributed $570.1 million to revenues driven by the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition.  Divestitures reduced revenues by $0.2 million.  The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a 19.1% increase in revenues in 2016.  The effect of foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted total revenues in 2016 by $88.0 million, or 2.9%, as foreign currencies declined against the U.S. dollar.

Gross profit:  Consolidated gross profit increased $232.1 million, or 18.5%, in 2016 to $1.49 billion from $1.25 billion in 2015.  The increase in 2016 gross profit primarily reflects the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition. As a percentage of revenues however, consolidated gross profit decreased to 41.7% in 2016 compared to 42.0% in 2015, primarily driven by costs incurred to exit certain of our patient

transport services contracts in the U.K. ($8.3 million) and lower international gross profit due to customer mix (fewer small customers which tend to provide higher gross profits).

SG&A:  Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $285.9 million, or 37.3%, in 2016 to $1.05 billion from $767.2 million in 2015 to support our increase in revenues and the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition.  Depreciation and amortization increased $94.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the Shred-it acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts due to market and economic conditions as we continued to experience challenges internationally and in our M&I waste services.  Primarily in our Brazil and Mexico markets in Latin America, the aging profiles of our older receivables were increasing and our collection efforts were not yielding a desired improvement.   Accordingly, we concluded that there was a higher degree of risk in our ability to collect those aged accounts and therefore determined that it would be appropriate to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts by increasing the reserve percentages applied to those aged accounts.  We also noted a significant increase in our M&I accounts receivable and increased the allowance related to those receivables. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 29.6% in 2016 compared to 25.7% in 2015.

Income from operations:  Consolidated income from operations decreased by $53.8 million, or 11.0%, in 2016 to $433.8 million from $487.6 million in 2015.  Comparison of income from operations between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the items described in Gross profit and SG&A above.

Net Interest Expense:  Net interest expense increased to $97.8 million in 2016 from $77.3 million in 2015, due to the full year impact of increased borrowings to fund the acquisition of Shred-it late in 2015.

Income Tax Expense:  Income tax expense decreased to $120.2 million in 2016 from $142.9 million in 2015.  The effective tax rates for the years 2016 and 2015 were 36.6% and 34.8%, respectively.  The increase in the 2016 tax rate, when compared to 2015, was primarily related to the recognition of tax benefits in 2015 as well as a higher proportion of pre-tax income in the U.S. which has a higher statutory tax rate, compared to international operations.

Gross profit:  Domestic and Canada RCS gross profit increased $212.5 million, or 23.4%, in 2016 to $1.12 billion from $908.8 million in 2015 reflecting the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition.  As a percentage of revenues, gross profit decreased to 44.7% in 2016 compared to 45.5% in 2015, primarily due to less than anticipated revenues from our M&I customers, which have a higher fixed cost structure.  Additionally, higher disposal costs for some of our industrial waste project work in 2016 unfavorably impacted domestic gross profit.

SG&A:  Domestic and Canada RCS SG&A expenses increased $111.7 million, or 27.6%, in 2016 to $515.8 million from $404.1 million in 2015, primarily related to the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition, increased compensation and marketing expenses, and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts driven by challenging market and economic conditions, which  encountered both macro-economic slowdowns in the general economy as well as the slow-down in the Manufacturing and Industrial (M&I) customer base.  As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 20.6% in 2016 compared to 20.2% in 2015.

Income from operations:  Domestic and Canada RCS income from operations increased $100.8 million, or 20.0%, in 2016 to $605.5 million from $504.7 million in 2015 reflecting the full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition.  Comparison of income from operations between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the items described in Gross profit and SG&A above.

Revenues:  International RCS revenues increased $34.9 million, or 4.9%, in 2016 to $751.7 million from $716.8 million in 2015.  Organic growth, currency rate fluctuations and acquisitions impacted the comparison of 2016 and 2015.  Organic growth in the International RCS segment contributed $33.1 million in revenues, or 4.6%.  The exit from certain of our patient transport services contracts in the U.K. negatively impacted our organic growth in 2016.  The effect of foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted international revenues in 2016 by $85.7 million, or 12.0%, as foreign currencies declined against the U.S. dollar.  Revenues from international acquisitions contributed $87.8 million to the increase in revenues in 2016 reflecting full year impact of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition.

Gross profit:  International RCS gross profit decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.8%, in 2016 to $228.5 million from $230.3 million in 2015.  As a percentage of revenues gross profit decreased to 30.4% in 2016 compared to 32.1% in 2015 due to the negative impact of higher costs related to servicing certain government contracts and charges incurred to exit some of the contracts in our U.K. patient transport services business, partially offset by the full-year inclusion of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition, which has a higher average gross profit.  In addition, our international gross profit was negatively impacted by the inability to pass full cost increases on to customers in areas of high inflation.

SG&A:  International RCS SG&A expenses increased $75.7 million, or 41.8%, in 2016 to $256.8 million from $181.1 million in 2015.  As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 34.2% in 2016 compared to

25.3% in 2015.  The following factors negatively impacted our international SG&A during 2016: the full year inclusion of the 2015 Shred-it acquisition, increased compensation expense in support of new business growth opportunities, and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to market and economic conditions as we continued to experience challenges internationally and in our M&I waste services.  Primarily in our Brazil and Mexico markets in Latin America, the aging profiles of our older receivables were increasing and our collection efforts were not yielding a desired improvement.  Accordingly, increasing the reserve percentages applied to those aged accounts.   Brazil and Mexico saw the largest increases to their allowance for doubtful accounts.

(Loss) income from operations:  International RCS income from operations decreased $77.5 million to a ($28.3) million loss in 2016 from $49.2 million income in 2015.  Comparison of (loss) income from operations between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the items described in Gross Profit and SG&A above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its stockholders.  Operating cash flows and the Company’s $1.2 billion senior credit facility are the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company’s long-term debt obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures necessary to support growth and productivity improvements, including associated with our multiyear Business Transformation, and any Board of Director approved stockholder distribution.

The Company’s credit facilities contain a number of covenants, including financial covenants, to which the Company was in compliance at December 31, 2017.  Based upon the Company’s expected 2018 Business Transformation investment plans, it is reasonably possible that the Company could exceed a Debt/EBITDA leverage threshold (leverage covenant) at some point in 2018.  This risk can be mitigated through appropriate spending controls and/or seeking temporary relief from the leverage covenant from our lenders.

Working Capital:  At December 31, 2017, our working capital decreased $386.7 million to ($156.0) million compared to $230.7 million at December 31, 2016.

Current assets increased $39.8 million in 2017 to $813.4 million from $773.6 million in 2016, primarily driven by a $33.8 million increase in prepaid expenses from the timing of our income tax payments, and $11.7 million increase in classification of assets held for sale, partially offset by a $10.8 million reduction in net accounts receivable.  Days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 63 days and 64 days at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Current liabilities increased $426.5 million in 2017 to $969.4 million from $542.9 million in 2016, primarily due to an accrual of $295.0 million related to the Settlement, $47.5 million reclassification of term loan debt from long-term to current, $24.2 million increase in accrued professional services, $22.9 million increase in accrued taxes, $22.9 million increase in accounts payable, and $11.7 million increase in accrued compensation and self-insurance.

Net Cash Provided or Used:  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $52.2 million, or 9.3%, in 2017 to $508.6 million from $560.8 million in 2016.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $2.6 million, or 1.3%, in 2017 to $193.0 million from $195.6 million in 2016.  We used $11.4 million less cash for acquisitions in 2017 than in 2016.  Our capital expenditures increased by $6.8 million in 2017 and, as a percentage of revenues, were at 4.0% and 3.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as we invested $10.9 million in our Business Transformation late in 2017 for software licenses related to the ERP system.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $55.6 million, or 14.8%, in 2017 to $321.2 million from $376.8 million in 2016.  We repaid a net of $175.6 million and $178.4 million of our senior credit facility, private placement, and term loan facility during 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We had preferred share repurchases of $34.2 million in 2017 compared to $40.8 million of common and $30.9 million of preferred share repurchases in 2016.  Dividends of $36.3 million and $39.4 million were paid during 2017 and 2016, respectively, to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock.

 (1) U.S. federal income tax on mandatory deemed repatriation is payable over 8 years pursuant to the Tax Act.

 (2) Environmental liabilities are presented above on an undiscounted basis and are associated with identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated but the timing of such payments is not fixed and determinable.

 (3) These amounts represent the scheduled principal payments related to our long-term debt and capital leases, excluding interest.

 (4) Interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates. Interest on debt with floating interest rates requires the use of management judgment to estimate the future rates of interest.

 (5) Operating lease obligations include various plant equipment, office furniture and equipment, motor vehicles, office and warehouse space, and landfill leasing arrangements. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2043.

 (6) Purchase obligations primarily represent no cancelable contractual obligations related to information technology products and services that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business.

Payments for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from contractual obligations.  Based on the uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with the applicable taxing authorities.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $130.8 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit, $19.0 million of surety bonds, and $15.7 million of bank guarantees. The bank guarantees are issued mostly by our international subsidiaries for various purposes, including leases, seller notes, contracts and permits. The surety bonds are used for performance guarantees. Neither the bank guarantees nor the surety bonds affect our ability to use our various lines of credit.

We anticipate that our operating cash flows, together with borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, strategic initiatives such as

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company’s most critical accounting policies are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company.  The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue Recognition:  We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenues for our regulated medical waste management services, other than our compliances services, and secure information destruction services are recognized at the time of waste collection.  Our compliance service revenues are recognized evenly over the contractual service period.  Payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided.  Revenues from hazardous waste services are recorded at the time waste is received at our processing facility or delivered to a third party.  Revenues from regulated recall and returns management services and communication solutions are recorded at the time services are performed.  Revenues from product sales are recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of ownership, which is generally at the time the goods are shipped to the customer.  Charges related to sales taxes and international value added tax ("VAT") and other similar pass through taxes are not included as revenue.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method.  The Company is applying certain practical expedients, including the right to invoice, where the criteria have been met.  The Company has concluded that there will not be a material change to its revenue recognition under the new standard. Certain costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers will be capitalized and amortized over the expected economic life of the contract.  We are in the process of finalizing the measurement of the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance, which will primarily be related to capitalizing commission costs, for recognition in our first quarter 2018 10-Q filing.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  The Company reports accounts receivable at their net realizable value, which is management’s best estimate of the cash that will ultimately be received.  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectability of accounts receivable based on historical collection data and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts.  The adequacy of allowances for uncollectible accounts is reviewed at least quarterly, and adjusted as necessary based on such reviews.  A considerable amount of management’s judgment is required to assess the collectability of an account, based on detailed analysis of the aging of the receivables, the creditworthiness of our customers, historical collection trends and current economic trends.  Accounts receivable written off in subsequent periods can differ from the allowance for doubtful accounts provided, but historically our

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 52

Part II

provision has been adequate.  Allowance for doubtful accounts was $65.2 million and $49.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Intangible Asset Valuations:  The methods commonly used to value intangible assets we acquire are the income, market and cost approaches.  The nature and characteristics of the asset indicate which approach is most appropriate.  Based on the analysis performed by the Company, the fair values of intangible assets are generally estimated using acceptable income approaches.

A multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) is generally used to determine the fair value of customer relationships.  The fair value is derived by calculating the present value of the estimated after-tax earnings attributable to the respective intangible assets.  Key inputs and assumptions to the valuation model are forecasted after-tax cash-flows, the identification of contributory assets and the quantification of appropriate returns on these assets, the discount rate applied to present value the cash-flows and attrition rates.  Determining an accurate consumption of benefits from acquired customer relationships cannot be reliably determined because the services we provide to acquired customers change from the base-line revenues over an extended period of time due to factors such as volume increase, price increase, and complementary service offerings.  Therefore, we amortize our finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method consistent with our valuation model.

A relief from royalty method is generally used to determine the fair value of tradenames.  Key inputs and assumptions to the valuation model are a reasonable approximation of the license rate for the trade name, forecasted revenues and the discount rate applied to present value the after-tax stream of estimated royalties avoided by acquiring the trade name.

Tangible Asset Valuation:  Trucks, containers and equipment are some of the major asset classes subject to revaluation as a result of our acquisitions.  The indirect and direct methods of the cost approach and the market approach are used by the Company to value tangible personal property assets.  Following is a description of the methodologies for estimating the fair value of the major tangible fixed asset classes:

 • The market approach is used for the valuation of trucks. The market approach is based on market conditions and transactions. In the market approach, the assets being valued are compared to recent sales and/or asking prices of comparable properties or assets. In using similar units of comparison, adjustments are made to the comparable assets to account for factors such as condition, capacity, and age.

 • The direct method of the cost approach is used in the valuation of containers. In the direct method of the cost approach, replacement cost new (“RCN”) is determined through current cost information obtained from original equipment manufacturers, equipment dealers and vendors, and independent research.

 • The cost of reproduction new (“CRN”) for equipment is calculated using the indirect method of the cost approach. Historical equipment costs and dates are used to calculate the current CRN. In the indirect method of the cost approach, trend factors are applied to the historical costs to estimate the CRN of the assets. Time-adjusted trend factors are applied to historical costs using asset category specific cost indices published by industry sources. The CRN is then adjusted for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets:  We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually as of October 1 or when an indicator of impairment exists.

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 53

Part II

Indefinite lived intangibles may be assessed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  The qualitative approach first determines if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value.  If no such determination is made, then the impairment test is complete.  If, however, it is determined that there is a likely impairment, a quantitative assessment must then be made.  One determination on whether to use the qualitative approach is the time since the last quantitative approach.

We used a quantitative approach to assess goodwill for impairment.  The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the income approach (including discounted cash flows) and validated using a market approach with the involvement of a third party valuation specialist.  The income approach uses expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts those cash flows to present value.  Expected future cash flows are calculated using management assumptions of growth rates, including long-term growth rates, capital expenditures, and cost efficiencies.  Future acquisitions are not included in the expected future cash flows.  We use a discount rate based on a calculated weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on size, country and company specific risk premiums.  The market approach compares the valuation multiples of similar companies to that of the associated reporting unit.  We then reconcile the calculated fair values to our market capitalization.  The fair value is then compared to its carrying value including goodwill.  If the fair value is in excess of its carrying value, the related goodwill is not impaired.  If the fair value is less than its carrying value.  We recognize an impairment loss in the amount that carrying value exceeds the fair value.

We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017 and recognized $65.0 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charges in our Latin America reporting unit. The fair value of our remaining reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying value. We believe that the estimated fair value used in measuring the impairment was based on reasonable assumptions.  We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 50 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate would result in an incremental impairment charge of approximately $5 million or $9 million, respectively.

We have determined that our permits and certain tradenames have indefinite lives due to our ability to renew them with minimal additional cost, and therefore they are not amortized.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test on indefinite lived intangibles, other than goodwill, using the qualitative approach for certain assets and the quantitative approach for the remaining assets. The calculated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, internal and external processing costs, and an appropriate discount rate determined by management.

Future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of the assumptions described above may negatively impact future valuations.  In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in assumptions could result in impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets that would require non-cash charges and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives using the straight-line method.  Our customer relationships have useful lives from 5 to 30 years based upon the type of customer.  We have non-compete covenant intangibles with useful lives from 5 to 14 years. We also have tradename intangibles with useful lives from 4 to 40 years.

We evaluate the useful life of our intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life and changes are reflected prospectively as the intangible asset is amortized over the revised remaining useful life.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company performed its annual assessment of the useful life of its finite-lived intangibles and concluded

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 54

Part II

its domestic medical waste customer relationship intangibles should be revised from 40 years to 30 years due to the change in mix of small and large quantity customer relationships.  The change in life is a change in estimate to be accounted for prospectively with an estimated increase to amortization expense of approximately $7.0 million annually.  These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities:  Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating air, groundwater, surface water, soil contamination, and applicable legal costs.  To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, and the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) and the financial viability of those parties.  We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, that amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site.  Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs.  Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers.

Income Taxes: We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.  Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.

Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.

In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.  Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.  However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.  At December 31, 2017, the valuation allowance of $16.1 million was related to foreign net operating losses and tax deductible goodwill that we are not expected to realize.

We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.  We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.  At December 31, 2017,

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 55

Part II

our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $27.4 million of which $22.2 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings.  Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.  Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.  The Tax Act results in a related change in assertion on expected foreign withholding taxes.

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") in December 2017 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act.  That guidance specifies that, for income tax effects of the Tax Act that can be reasonably estimated but for which the accounting and measurement analysis is not yet complete, entities should report provisional amounts in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and those provisional amounts can be adjusted for a measurement period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.  Additionally, for income tax effects of the Tax Act that cannot be reasonably estimated, entities should report provisional amounts for those income tax effects in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined, not to exceed one year from the enactment date.

In accordance with SAB 118, based on our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing, the Company has calculated with the involvement of a third party tax specialist its best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on its year end 2017 income tax provision and as a result has recorded an income tax (benefit) of ($129.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.  The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future is an income tax (benefit) of ($167.7) million.  The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is an income tax expense of $24.3 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $149.2 million and $13.6 million related to expected foreign withholding taxes.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has re-evaluated its assertion related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings and recorded a provisional deferred tax liability in the amount of $13.6 million for expected withholding taxes related to remittances between certain foreign subsidiaries.  Although the Company has recorded this deferred tax liability, the Company is still evaluating how the Tax Act will affect the Company’s accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings.  During the measurement period, the Company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740 – Income Taxes.  Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.

The Tax Act also establishes global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions that impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on intangible assets of foreign corporations.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of prospective taxes on GILTI and has not yet determined

2017 10-K Annual Report Stericycle, Inc. • 56

Part II

whether its accounting policy will be to recognize deferred taxes for basis differences that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal or to recognize taxes on GILTI as an expense in the period incurred.  While the Company is still evaluating its prospective accounting policy for taxes on GILTI, the provisional estimates of the tax effects of the Tax Act were reported on the basis that the taxes on GILTI will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense.

For further information see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 8 – Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insured and Self-Insured Claims:  We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our employee benefit, auto/fleet, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs.  The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on third party actuarial valuations and internal estimates.  The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used.  Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.

Stock Based Compensation:  We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award or on the fair value of the liabilities incurred.  That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) for date vesting awards.  Performance based awards are recorded consistent with performance metrics and ASC 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation.  No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.

The grant-date fair value of incentive stock options (“ISOs”) and similar instruments are estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available).  Option-pricing models (Black Scholes) include assumptions that are evaluated by a third party valuation specialist and evaluated and approved by the VP and Treasurer based on historical experience, current company trends and comparative analysis to industry trends.  If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification.

Restricted shares (“RSUs”) awarded to an employee and Performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) awarded to an executive officer are measured at its fair value, which is the same amount for which a similarly restricted share would be issued to third parties.  A non-vested equity share unit awarded to an employee is measured at its fair value as if it were vested and issued on the grant date.

Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

For further detail, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 12 – Stock Based Compensation in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring:   Involuntary termination benefits are accrued upon the commitment to a termination plan and when the benefit arrangement is communicated to affected employees, or when liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable, depending on the existence of a substantive plan for severance or termination. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Contract termination costs are recorded when contracts are terminated or when we cease to use

Part II

the leased facility and no longer derives economic benefit from the contract. All other exit costs are expensed as incurred.

Restructuring liabilities might change in future periods based on several factors that could differ from original estimates and assumptions.  These include, but are not limited to, contract settlements on terms different than originally expected, ability to sublease properties based on market conditions at rates or timelines different than originally estimated or changes to original plans as a result of acquisitions.  Such changes might result in reversals of or additions to restructuring charges that could affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income of future periods.
