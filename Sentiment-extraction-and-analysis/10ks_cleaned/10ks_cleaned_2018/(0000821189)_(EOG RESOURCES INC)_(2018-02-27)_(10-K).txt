ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China.  EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.

EOG realized net income of $2,583 million during 2017 as compared to a net loss of $1,097 million for 2016. At December 31, 2017, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 380 MMBoe from December 31, 2016.  During 2017, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 223 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 945 billion cubic feet or 158 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2016.

Operations

Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2017.

United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.

During 2017, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. These efficiency gains along with certain realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2017. EOG continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 77% of United States production during 2017 as compared to 73% for 2016. During 2017, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. In 2017, EOG completed and brought on-line two net wells finishing its program in the Sercan Area and drilled and completed five additional net wells in the Banyan and Osprey fields. EOG conducted a seismic survey in the U(a) Block, participated in a seismic survey program with a joint venture partner in the Ska, Mento and Reggae area and signed a new multi-year contract under which EOG will supply future natural gas volumes to NGC beginning in 2019.

Other International. In the United Kingdom, EOG produces crude oil from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy project. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, production in the Conwy was off-line due to facility improvements and operational issues. EOG resumed production in the first quarter of 2018.

In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG drilled five natural gas wells and completed four of those wells in 2017 as part of the continuing development of the Bajiaochang Field, which natural gas is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina.

EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

In December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which made significant changes to United States federal income tax law. Under the Income Taxes Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification, the effects of new legislation are recognized upon enactment. Accordingly, recognition of the tax effects of the TCJA is required in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the TCJA made several changes to United States corporate income tax laws, some of which will have a material impact on EOG's tax provision for 2017 and subsequent periods, including the reduction in the statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the conversion to the territorial system of taxation of foreign earnings. The TCJA is expected to reduce EOG's effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years, though the ultimate impact on its worldwide effective tax rate will depend on the percentage of pretax income generated by EOG in the United States as compared to its other jurisdictions.

Capital Structure

One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group.  EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2017 and 33% at December 31, 2016.  As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.

On September 15, 2017, EOG repaid upon maturity the $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017.
On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to EOG's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of EOG's authorized shares of common stock from 640 million to 1,280 million. EOG's stockholders approved the increase at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 27, 2017, and the amendment was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on April 28, 2017.
During 2017, EOG funded $4.6 billion ($282 million of which was non-cash property exchanges) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $387 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $227 million from the sale of assets.

Total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2018 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.

When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.

Results of Operations

The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.

Net Operating Revenues and Other

During 2017, net operating revenues increased $3,557 million, or 47%, to $11,208 million from $7,651 million in 2016. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $2,411 million, or 44%, to $7,908 million in 2017 from $5,497 million in 2016. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2017 were approximately 88% of total wellhead revenues compared to 86% in 2016. During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million compared to net losses of $100 million in 2016. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $1,332 million during 2017, to $3,298 million from $1,966 million in 2016. Net losses on asset dispositions of $99 million in 2017 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in Texas and the Rocky Mountain area compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $206 million in 2016.

2017 compared to 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased $1,939 million, or 45%, to $6,256 million from $4,317 million in 2016, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,124 million) and an increase in production ($815 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22% to $50.91 per barrel compared to $41.76 per barrel in 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19% to 337 MBbld as compared to 283 MBbld in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area.

NGL revenues in 2017 increased $292 million, or 67%, to $729 million from $437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead NGL price ($257 million) and an increase in production ($35 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 55% to $22.61 per barrel in 2017 compared to $14.63 per barrel in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by decreased production in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region.

Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased $180 million, or 24%, to $922 million from $742 million in 2016, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($227 million), partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($47 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32% to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017 compared to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016. Natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6% to 1,103 MMcfd as compared to 1,175 MMcfd in 2016. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (45 MMcfd) and Trinidad (27 MMcfd). The decreased production in the United States was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and other affiliated entities (collectively, the Yates Entities). The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016.

During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million.

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased $9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and NGL marketing activities ($16 million), partially offset by lower margins on sand sales ($9 million).

2016 compared to 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased $618 million, or 13%, to $4,317 million from $4,935 million in 2015, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12% to $41.76 per barrel compared to $47.53 per barrel in 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1% to 283 MBbld as compared to 284 MBbld in 2015. The decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, largely offset by increased production in the Permian Basin.

NGL revenues in 2016 increased $29 million, or 7%, to $437 million from $408 million in 2015, due to an increase of 5 MBbld, or 6%, in NGL deliveries primarily as a result of increased production in the Permian Basin.

Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased $319 million, or 30%, to $742 million from $1,061 million in 2015, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($246 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($73 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25% to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016 compared to $2.30 per Mcf in 2015. Natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7% to 1,175 MMcfd as compared to 1,265 MMcfd in 2015. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (76 MMcfd). The decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of the Yates Entities.

35

During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million. During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million.

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased $91 million compared to 2015, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales.

Operating and Other Expenses

2017 compared to 2016.  During 2017, operating expenses of $10,282 million were $1,406 million higher than the $8,876 million incurred during 2016.  The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

------------------------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- - -----

 2017 2016

Lease and Well $ 4.70 $ 4.53
Transportation Costs 3.33 3.73
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -
Oil and Gas Properties 14.83 16.77
Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.51 0.57
General and Administrative (G&A) 1.95 1.93
Net Interest Expense 1.23 1.37
Total (1) $ 26.55 $ 28.90

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below.  See "Net Operating Revenues and Other" above for a discussion of production volumes.

Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property.  Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses.  Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power.  Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.

Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time.

Lease and well expenses of $1,045 million in 2017 increased $118 million from $927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($71 million) and the United Kingdom ($30 million) and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.

Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale.  Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.

Transportation costs of $740 million in 2017 decreased $24 million from $764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the Barnett Shale and Upper Gulf Coast ($85 million) and decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($8 million) and the United Kingdom ($8 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the Permian Basin ($47 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($20 million) and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($13 million).

36

DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations.  There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments.  Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets.

DD&A expenses in 2017 decreased $144 million to $3,409 million from $3,553 million in 2016.  DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were $141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($449 million) and Trinidad ($19 million) and a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($16 million) and Trinidad ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in production in the United States ($354 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.

G&A expenses of $434 million in 2017 increased $39 million from $395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($45 million) and increased professional, legal and other services ($30 million), partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements ($42 million).

Net interest expense of $274 million in 2017 was $8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($4 million).

Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets and certain charges from third-party processors.

Gathering and processing costs increased $26 million to $149 million in 2017 compared to $123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the Permian Basin ($12 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million).

Exploration costs of $145 million in 2017 increased $20 million from $125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad.

Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.

The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

----------------------------------- ---- --- ---- --- - ---

 2017 2016

Proved properties $ 224 $ 116
Unproved properties 211 291
Other assets 28 —
Other property, plant and equipment 16 14
Inventories — 61
Firm commitment contracts — 138
Total $ 479 $ 620

37

Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.

Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes.  Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.

Taxes other than income in 2017 increased $195 million to $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) in 2016. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($171 million) and in ad valorem property taxes ($18 million), both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States.

Other income, net, was $9 million in 2017 compared to other expense, net, of $51 million in 2016. The increase of $60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 ($49 million) and interest income ($5 million).

EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion.  Due largely to this tax rate reduction, the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to (291)% from 30% in the prior year.  See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the income tax changes enacted by TCJA affecting EOG.

2016 compared to 2015.  During 2016, operating expenses of $8,876 million were $6,568 million lower than the $15,444 million incurred during 2015.  Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

------------------------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- - -----

 2016 2015

Lease and Well $ 4.53 $ 5.66
Transportation Costs 3.73 4.07
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -
Oil and Gas Properties 16.77 15.27
Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.57 0.59
General and Administrative (G&A) 1.93 1.75
Net Interest Expense 1.37 1.14
Total (1) $ 28.90 $ 28.48

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below.  See "Net Operating Revenues and Other" above for a discussion of production volumes.

Lease and well expenses of $927 million in 2016 decreased $255 million from $1,182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs ($218 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($35 million), both in the United States.

Transportation costs of $764 million in 2016 decreased $85 million from $849 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($55 million), the Barnett Shale ($21 million), the Eagle Ford ($19 million) and the Upper Gulf Coast region ($10 million) primarily due to lower production and service cost reductions in these regions, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the Permian Basin ($18 million).

DD&A expenses in 2016 increased $239 million to $3,553 million from $3,314 million in 2015.  DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were $247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the United States ($300 million) and China ($3 million) and commencement of crude oil production from the Conwy field in the United Kingdom ($22 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United States ($68 million) and Trinidad ($4 million) and lower unit rates in Trinidad ($6 million). Unit rates in the United States increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at December 31, 2015, as a result of lower commodity prices.

G&A expenses of $395 million in 2016 increased $28 million from $367 million in 2015 primarily due to employee-related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the Yates transaction.

Net interest expense of $282 million in 2016 was $45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in January 2016 ($43 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($10 million). This was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in February 2016 and June 2015 ($16 million).

Gathering and processing costs decreased $23 million to $123 million in 2016 compared to $146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and the Barnett Shale ($7 million).

Exploration costs of $125 million in 2016 decreased $24 million from $149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses ($14 million), partially offset by higher delay rentals ($5 million), all in the United States.

The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

----------------------------------- ---- --- ---- --- - -----

 2016 2015

Proved properties $ 116 $ 6,326
Unproved properties 291 288
Other property, plant and equipment 14 —
Inventories 61 —
Firm commitment contracts 138 —
Total $ 620 $ 6,614

Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015. Impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.

Taxes other than income in 2016 decreased $72 million to $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) from $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2015. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valorem/property taxes ($49 million) and in severance/production taxes ($34 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, both in the United States. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2016 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($12 million).

Other expense, net, was $51 million in 2016 compared to other income, net, of $2 million in 2015. The increase of $53 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and increased deferred compensation expense.

EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. The net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30% from 35% in the prior year primarily due to additional Trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 ($43 million).

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Cash Flow

The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales.  The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.

2017 compared to 2016.  Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,265 million in 2017 increased $1,906 million from $2,359 million in 2016 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,411 million) and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($30 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($362 million), an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($228 million), an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($23 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($10 million).

Net cash used in investing activities of $3,987 million in 2017 increased by $2,734 million from $1,253 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,461 million); a decrease in proceeds from asset sales ($892 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($246 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($80 million).

Net cash used in financing activities of $1,036 million in 2017 included repayments of long-term debt ($600 million), cash dividend payments ($387 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million).

2016 compared to 2015.  Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,359 million in 2016 decreased $1,236 million from $3,595 million in 2015 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($907 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($752 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($197 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($30 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($442 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($80 million).

Net cash used in investing activities of $1,253 million in 2016 decreased by $4,067 million from $5,320 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,235 million); an increase in proceeds from asset sales ($926 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($656 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($195 million); and net cash received from the Yates transaction ($55 million).

Net cash used for financing activities of $243 million in 2016 included repayments of long-term debt ($564 million), cash dividend payments ($373 million), net commercial paper repayments ($260 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($82 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($991 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($29 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million).

Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 4,440 6,445 4,928
Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3) 173 109 288
Total Expenditures $ 4,613 $ 6,554 $ 5,216

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Leasehold acquisitions included $256 million in 2017 related to non-cash property exchanges and $3,115 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Property acquisitions included $26 million in 2017 related to non-cash property exchanges and $735 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Other property, plant and equipment included $17 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

Exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million for 2017 were $2,081 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased leasehold acquisitions ($2,790 million) and decreased property acquisitions ($676 million), partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,052 million), Trinidad ($106 million) and Other International ($17 million); increased facilities expenditures ($200 million); and increased geological and geophysical expenditures ($20 million). The 2017 exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million included $3,661 million in development drilling and facilities, $623 million in exploration, $73 million in property acquisitions and $27 million in capitalized interest. The 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest.

The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors.  EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.

Derivative Transactions

Commodity Derivative Contracts.  Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Midland Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Midland Differential basis swap contracts through February 20, 2018. The weighted average price differential expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) represents the amount of reduction to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) covered by the basis swap contracts.

Financing

EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2017, compared to 33% at December 31, 2016.  As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,390 million and $6,990 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,602 million and $7,190 million, respectively.  The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end.  EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates.  While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.

During 2017, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program.  While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2017 was $803 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero.  There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2017. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $84 million during the year 2017.  EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, (in thousands):

(1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, repatriation tax liability, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2017. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).

44

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships.  Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

During 2017, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Canada.  The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2017 was the British pound.  EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Outlook

Pricing.  Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future.  The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2018 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 20, 2018, the average 2018 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $60.75 per barrel and $2.81 per MMBtu, respectively, representing an increase of 19% for crude oil and a decrease of 9% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2017. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.

Including the impact of EOG's 2018 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2018 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $82 million for net income and $106 million for cash flows from operating activities.  Including the impact of EOG's 2018 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of call options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2018 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $22 million for net income and $29 million for cash flows from operating activities.  For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 20, 2018, see "Derivative Transactions" above.

Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs.

The total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures of approximately $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.

Operations. In 2018, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2017 levels. In 2018, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies

EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application.  Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.  Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets.  Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and "Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.  Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred.  The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves.  If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties

The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.

Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC.  The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.

Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.

46

Impairments

Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred.  Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.

When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC.  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.  Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future.

Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future.  During the five years ended December 31, 2017, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $110.62 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu.  EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available.  Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates.  Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the TCJA, which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. Shortly after enactment of the TCJA, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the TCJA. Under SAB 118, an entity would use a similar approach as the measurement period provided in the Business Combinations Topic of the ASC. An entity will recognize those matters for which the accounting can be completed. For matters that have not been completed, the entity would either (1) recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information becomes available or (2) for any specific income tax effects of the TCJA for which a reasonable estimate cannot be determined, continue to apply the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the TCJA was signed into law. EOG has prepared its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC as allowed by SAB 118.

Stock-Based Compensation

In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.

Other property, plant and equipment 16 14
Inventories — 61
Firm commitment contracts — 138
Total $ 479 $ 620

37

Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.

Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes.  Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.

Taxes other than income in 2017 increased $195 million to $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) in 2016. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($171 million) and in ad valorem property taxes ($18 million), both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States.

Other income, net, was $9 million in 2017 compared to other expense, net, of $51 million in 2016. The increase of $60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 ($49 million) and interest income ($5 million).

EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion.  Due largely to this tax rate reduction, the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to (291)% from 30% in the prior year.  See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the income tax changes enacted by TCJA affecting EOG.

2016 compared to 2015.  During 2016, operating expenses of $8,876 million were $6,568 million lower than the $15,444 million incurred during 2015.  Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies

EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG']:

['s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets.  Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and "]:
