Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Critical Accounting Policies
The Company follows accounting and reporting policies and procedures that conform, in all material respects, to GAAP and to practices generally applicable to the financial services industry, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and amounts disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures that are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgment and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the Company's most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates, which have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors, as follows:
Investment Securities
Under ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in AOCI and do not affect earnings until realized unless a decline in fair value below amortized cost is considered to be OTTI.
The fair values of the Company’s securities are generally determined by reference to quoted prices from reliable independent third party sources and pricing services utilizing observable inputs. Certain of the Company’s fair values of securities may be determined by third party source and pricing services that may use models whose significant value drivers or assumptions may be unobservable and are significant to the fair value of the securities. These models are utilized when quoted prices are not available for certain securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased. When quoted prices are not available and are not provided by third party sources or pricing services, management judgment is necessary to determine fair value. As such, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis models, incorporating default rates, estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities.
The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if OTTI exists pursuant to guidelines established in ASC 320. In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies or government sponsored agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition.
If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of the OTTI to be recognized in earnings. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as AOCI in stockholders’ equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
The Company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense, and represents management’s best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company performs an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance at least on a quarterly basis. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan and lease loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control, including performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates, and regulatory authorities altering their loan classification guidance.
The allowance consists of three elements: (i) specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans and leases, (ii) quantitative valuation allowances calculated using loss experience for like loans and leases with similar characteristics and trends, adjusted, as necessary to reflect the impact of current conditions; and (iii) qualitative allowances based on environmental and other factors that may be internal or external to the Company.
Goodwill
Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but are periodically evaluated for impairment. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.
In accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2011-08 Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. In other words, before the first step of the existing guidance, the entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes adverse events or circumstances identified that could negatively affect the reporting units’ fair value as well as positive and mitigating events. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant change in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization; unanticipated competition; and an action or assessment by a regulator. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step process is unnecessary. The entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment step for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the exiting two-step process. The entity can resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
The first step of the goodwill impairment test is performed, when considered necessary, by comparing the reporting unit’s aggregate fair value to its carrying value. Absent other indicators of impairment, if the aggregate fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the aggregate fair value, a second step would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure any impairment loss the implied fair value would be determined in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference.
The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of August 31. At the Measurement Date, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, evaluated, based on the weight of evidence, the significance of all qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The assessment of qualitative factors at the Measurement Date indicated that it is not more likely than not that impairment existed; as a result no further testing was performed.
Even though there was no goodwill impairment at December 31, 2017, adverse events may impact the recoverability of goodwill and could result in a future impairment charge which could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
A servicing asset or liability is recognized when undertaking an obligation to service a financial asset under a mortgage servicing contract, including a transfer of the servicer’s financial assets that meet the requirements for sale accounting. Such servicing asset or liability is initially measured at fair value based on either market prices for comparable servicing contracts or alternatively is based on a valuation model that is based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee, net of servicing costs, over the estimated life of the loan, using a discount rate based on the related loan rate and is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company measures servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date and reports changes in fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur, and such changes are included within Net Revenue on Mortgage Banking Activities on the Statements of Operations of discontinued operations. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimates and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Currently the Company does not hedge the effects of changes in fair value of its servicing assets. At December 31, 2017, MSRs of $29.8 million were classified as held-for-sale and valued based on a market bid adjusted for estimated early payoffs and paydowns.
Servicing fee income, which is reported in Loan Servicing Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material.
Income Tax
H.R. 1, originally known as the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," was enacted on December 22, 2017, which among other items, permanently reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. ASC 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment; therefore, the effect is recognized in the Company’s 2017 consolidated financial statements, even though the effective date of the law is January 1, 2018. The Company remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. As a result, the Company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $2.1 million in its Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $31.1 million consisting of federal net deferred tax assets of $23.6 million and state net deferred tax assets of $7.5 million. Federal net deferred tax assets included tax credits of $27.6 million, which is not impacted by the tax rate reduction, hence not subject to revaluation. Excluding tax credit related deferred tax assets, the Company is in a net federal deferred tax liability position, which is the main driver for the $2.1 million tax benefit as the result of the tax rate reduction.
The Company expects an overall 2018 statutory tax rate (including federal and state taxes) to be approximately 29 percent.
Alternative Energy Partnerships
The Company invests in certain alternative energy partnerships (limited liability companies) formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits (energy tax credits) and other tax benefits. The Company is a limited partner in these partnerships, which were formed to invest in newly installed residential rooftop solar leases and power purchase agreements.
As the Company’s respective investments in these entities are more than minor, the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result, the Company is required to apply the equity method of accounting, which generally prescribes applying the percentage ownership interest to the investee’s GAAP net income in order to determine the investor’s earnings or losses in a given period. However, because the liquidation rights, tax credit allocations and other benefits to investors can change upon the occurrence of specified events, application of the equity method based on the underlying ownership percentages would not accurately represent the Company’s investment. As a result, the Company applies the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method of the equity method of accounting. The HLBV method is a balance sheet approach where a calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to estimate the amount that the Company would receive if the equity investment entity were to liquidate all of its assets (as valued in accordance with GAAP) and distribute that cash to the investors based on the contractually defined liquidation priorities. The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is the Company’s share of the earnings or losses from the equity investment for the period.
To account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships, the Company uses the flow-through income statement method. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax differences in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned. The Company does not believe the investments in alternative energy partnerships are impaired by the lower corporate income tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to the protective provision built into the partnership agreements; however, the Company expects to take longer to utilize the investment tax credits generated from these investments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The following are recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company that have not yet been adopted:
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” The amendments in this Update outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This Update is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This Update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. This Update as amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, ASU 2017-13, and ASU 2017-14 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and entities have the option of using either a modified retrospective or full retrospective approach for the adoption. The Company’s revenue streams primarily consist of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of this Update explicitly excludes net interest income, as well as other revenues from transactions involving financial instruments, such as loans, leases, and securities. Certain noninterest income items such as service charges on deposits accounts, gain and loss on other real estate owned sales, and other income items are in the scope of this Update. The Company evaluated the accounting impact of adopting this guidance based on the following “Five-step Model” prescribed in ASC 606:

--- ----------------------
(i) identify the contract;

---- ----------------------------------------------------
(ii) identify the performance obligation in the contract;

----- --------------------------------
(iii) determine the transaction price;

---- ------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
(v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company identified and reviewed the revenue streams within the scope of the Update, including escrow fees, trust and fiduciary fees, deposit service fees, debit card fees, investment commissions, and gains on sales of OREO. The Company determined that the new guidance will not require significant changes to the manner in which income from those revenue streams is currently recognized. As such, the Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This Update amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; it simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments by requiring a qualitative assessment; it eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose methods and assumptions for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the statement of financial position; it requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability; it requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category; and certain other requirements. This ASU becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early application of the amendments in this Update is not permitted. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The amendments in this Update require lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases, as well as define classification criteria for distinguishing between financing leases and operating leases. For financing leases, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position, recognize interest on the lease liability in the statement of comprehensive income, and classify the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position, recognize a single lease cost calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over lease term on a straight line basis, and classify all cash payments as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged, but does align the transfer of control principle for a sale in Topic 606 to leases. For example, whether a lease is similar to a sale of the underlying asset depends on whether the lessee, in effect, obtains control of the underlying asset as a result of the lease. For public business entities, the amendments as amended by ASU 2017-13 to this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)." The amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to measure credit loss estimates. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)." The amendments in this Update provide guidance on classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. For public business entities that are SEC filers, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).” The amendments in this Update are intended to reduce diversity in practice regarding classification of changes in restricted cash, requiring an entity to provide changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents during the period in a statement of cash flows. This Update is effective for public business entities with their fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805).” The amendments in this Update provide guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This Update provides a more robust framework to use when an entity determines whether a set of assets and activities is a business. Public business entities must prospectively apply the amendment in this Update to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” The amendments in this Update eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, reducing the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment. Instead, an entity shall perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. For an impairment charge, an entity must recognize the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, but the loss recognized shall not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Furthermore, the amendment in this Update requires an entity to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. Public business entities that are SEC filers must adopt the amendments in this Update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, “Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets.” The amendments in this Update clarify the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets, including real estate, and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales. An entity should identify each distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset promised to a counterparty and derecognize each asset when a counterparty obtains control of it. An in substance nonfinancial asset is an asset within a contract or subsidiary in which substantially all of the fair value of the asset is concentrated in a nonfinancial asset. In addition, the amendment requires an entity to derecognize a distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset in a partial sale transaction when the entity does not retain a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the asset and an entity transfers control of the asset. Once control is transferred, any non-controlling interest received is required to be measured at fair value. The effective date of the new guidance is aligned with the requirements in the new revenue standard, which is effective for public business entities in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, “Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities." The amendments in this Update shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities acquired at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount, which continue to be amortized to maturity. Public business entities must prospectively apply the amendments in this Update to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods. The Company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09. “Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.” The amendments in this Update provide guidance on when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award are to be accounted for as modifications. Under the new guidance, entities are not required to apply modification accounting to a share-based payment award when the award’s fair value, vesting conditions, and classification as an entity or a liability instrument remain the same after the change. The new guidance is effective for all entities beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. The Company concluded that the new guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12. “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.” The amendments in this Update are to better reflect the economic results of hedging in the financial statements along with simplification of certain hedge accounting requirements. Specifically, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is required to be presented in the same income statement line as and in the same period that the earnings effect of the hedged item is recognized. Therefore, hedge ineffectiveness will not be reported separately or in a different period. In addition, hedge effectiveness can be determined qualitatively in periods following inception. The amendments permit an entity to measure the change in fair value of the hedged item on the basis of the benchmark rate component. They also permit an entity to measure the hedged item for a partial-term fair value hedge of interest rate risk by assuming the hedged item has a term that reflects only the designated cash flows being hedged. For a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets, an entity is permitted to designate the amount that is not expected to be affected by prepayments or defaults as the hedged item. For public business entities, the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02. "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." The amendments in this Update allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amendments in this Update also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The amendments in this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the legislation is recognized. The Company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Executive Overview
The Company is focused on California and core banking products and services designed to cater to the unique needs of California's diverse private businesses, entrepreneurs and communities through its 34 full service branches in San Diego, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles Counties. The Company offer a variety of financial products and services designed around its target client in order to serve all of their banking and financial needs.
Financial Highlights
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, net income from continuing operations was $53.5 million, $86.7 million and $41.1 million, respectively. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per total common share were $0.63, $1.34 and $0.78, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was due mainly to increases in noninterest expense and provision for loan and lease losses and decreases in noninterest income and net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. The increase in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income and decreases in income tax expense and provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
Total assets were $10.33 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $702.0 million, or 6.4 percent, from $11.03 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in investment securities and loans held-for-sale, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases held-for-investment.
Significant financial highlights include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Banc Home Loans division, which largely reflected the Company's Mortgage Banking segment. The Company determined that the sale of its Mortgage Banking segment met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. This transaction advanced the Company's strategy to focus its business on core commercial banking opportunities in its California markets.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Return on average assets was 0.55 percent and 1.12 percent, respectively, and return on average tangible common equity was 5.79 percent and 16.97 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Efficiency ratio was 88.52 percent and 74.11 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Efficiency ratio as adjusted to include the pre-tax effect of investments in alternative energy projects was 77.18 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 67.13 percent for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was mainly due to a decrease in noninterest income. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized higher net gains on sale of securities available-for-sale and loans, advisory service fees and loan brokerage income as well as gain on sale of subsidiary and business unit.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Effective tax rate for continuing operations was (98.8) percent for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $2.1 million for remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of H.R. 1, originally known as the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act", an income tax benefit of $2.2 million for excess tax benefits from stock compensation, and tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $38.2 million, partially offset by tax expense of $6.7 million from tax basis reduction related to investments in alternative energy partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2017.

• Total investment securities, at amortized cost basis, were $2.57 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $713.8 million, or 21.8 percent, from $3.28 billion at December 31, 2016. The Company repositioned its securities available-for-sale portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling certain longer-duration and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities. The proceeds from such sales were primarily used to fund loan originations.

• Loans and leases receivable, net of ALLL, were $6.61 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $615.8 million, or 10.3 percent, from $5.99 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was due mainly to increased originations during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by the sale of the Banc Home Loans division during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the sale of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the three months ended September 30, 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total deposits were $7.29 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.85 billion, or 20.2 percent, from $9.14 billion at December 31, 2016. The Company reduced its reliance on brokered and other high-rate and high-volatility deposits by replacing them with more predictable advances from FHLB with the goal of increasing core deposits to fund new loan originations.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net interest income was $311.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.2 million, or 4.4 percent, from $325.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense, primarily due to an increase in the average rate paid, on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in interest income earned on total loans and leases, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of loans and leases, partially offset by higher interest income from securities.
Interest income on total loans and leases was $288.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.9 million, or 3.0 percent, from $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest income on total loans and leases was due to a $249.8 million decrease in average total loans and leases, partially offset by a 3 bps increase in average yield. Ending balance of total loans and leases increased during the year ended December 31, 2017; however, the average balance decreased as the ending balance increased, which was mainly driven by a larger increase during the three months ended December 31, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, total loans and leases decreased by $403.4 million to $6.34 billion due mainly to the sale of the Banc Home Loans division during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the sale of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the three months ended September 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, total loans and leases increased by $429.2 million to $6.77 billion due mainly to higher loan production in commercial loans. Year-over-year, total loans and leases increased by $25.8 million, or 0.4 percent, to $6.77 billion at December 31, 2017 from $6.74 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in average yield was mainly due to higher interest rates on new loans and loans with variable interest rates from a rising interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools where discounts on these pools generated additional interest income. Such discount accretion totaled $4.8 million and $36.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Interest income on total loans and leases was $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $55.4 million, or 23.0 percent, from $241.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income on total loans and leases was due to a $1.48 billion increase in average total loans and leases, partially offset by an 18 bps decrease in average yield. The increase in average balance was mainly due to increased originations of loans and leases during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in average yield was mainly due to the lower yields on new loans and leases during the year ended December 31, 2016 and a decrease in the proportion of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools to total loans and leases where discounts on these pools generate additional interest income. Such discount accretion totaled $36.8 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Interest income on securities was $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $59.3 million, or 292.5 percent, from $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income on securities was due to a $1.93 billion increase in average balance and a 32 bps increase in average yield. The increases were mainly due to purchases of $5.77 billion of investment securities available-for-sale to reduce excess liquidity from the common and preferred stock offerings and deposit increase, partially offset by principal payments, paydowns, calls and sales of $4.21 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average yield was mainly due to higher yields on newly purchased investment securities and to an increase in yields on certain floating rate investment securities during the fourth quarter of 2016 as overall market rates increased.
Dividends and interest income on other interest-earning assets was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.9 million, or 87.0 percent, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in dividends and interest income on other interest-earning assets was due to a $104.0 million increase in average balance and a 59 bps increase in average yield. The increase in average balance was mainly due to the excess cash from the common stock offerings and deposit increase. The increase in average yield was mainly due to a $3.0 million increase in dividend income on FHLB and other bank stocks.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $14.4 million, or 56.0 percent, from $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was the result of a $2.22 billion increase in average balance and a 2 bps increase in average cost. The increase in average balance was mainly due to strong retail deposit growth, as well as an increase in the average balance per account as the Company continues to build stronger relationship with its clients. The Company also utilized brokered deposits to provide sufficient liquidity for the Company. The increase in average cost was mainly due to the overall higher interest rates on new deposit accounts and higher utilization of brokered deposits.
Interest expense on FHLB advances was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.6 million, or 169.7 percent, from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense on FHLB advances was due mainly to a $600.0 million increase in average balance and a 12 bps increase in average cost. The increase in average balance was due to an increase in operating liquidity to support the Company's growth throughout the year. The increase in average cost resulted from the rising interest rate environment.
Interest expense on securities sold under repurchase agreements was $818 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $800 thousand, or 4,444.4 percent, from $18 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company utilized an increased amount of the repurchase agreements in order to diversify its funding sources.
Interest expense on long-term debt and other interest-bearing liabilities was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 13.3 percent, from $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the redemption of the Company's 7.50 percent senior notes due April 15, 2020 during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
Provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to operations at a level required to reflect incurred credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Company recorded $13.7 million, $5.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to its provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly due to methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2017, such as an extension of the look-back period, refined measurement of qualitative adjustments, reduced loan segmentation, and an annual update of the loss emergence period, as well as the growth in the loan and lease portfolio. The decrease in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly due to the improved asset quality, which resulted in low net charge-offs and declining quantitative loss rates and qualitative factors in line with the current economic and business environment.

The increase was mainly due to increases in professional fees, occupancy and equipment, all other expenses, a decrease in reversal for loan repurchases, and the recognition of restructuring expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by decreases in salaries and employee benefits, outside service fees, and advertising expense.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, income tax (benefit) expense of continuing operations was $(26.6) million, $13.7 million and $28.0 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was (98.8) percent, 13.7 percent and 40.6 percent, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was lower than the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to recognition of an income tax benefit of $2.1 million from remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of result of the enactment of H.R. 1, originally known as the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," an income tax benefit of $2.2 million for excess tax benefits from stock compensation, and tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $38.2 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $6.7 million related to investments in alternative energy partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $33.4 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $5.8 million related to investments in alternative energy partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company uses the flow-through income statement method to account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnership. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax difference in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1 was enacted into law. The legislation provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction of the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 21 percent and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions. The Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the reduced federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. This remeasurement resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.1 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded $2.2 million of income tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to excess tax benefits from stock compensation. Prior to 2017, such excess tax benefits were generally recorded directly in stockholders’ equity. This new accounting standard may increase the volatility in the Company’s effective tax rates.

Discontinued Operations
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment. In accordance with ASC 205-20, the Company determined that the sale of the Banc Home Loans division and certain other mortgage banking related assets and liabilities that will be sold or settled separately within one year met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and its operating results and financial condition have been presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements. Certain components of the Company’s Mortgage Banking segment, including MSRs on certain conventional government SFR mortgage loans that were not sold as part of the Banc Home Loans sale and repurchase reserves related to previously sold loans, have been classified as continuing operations in the financial statements, as they will continue to be part of the Company’s ongoing operations. The Banc Home Loans division originated conforming SFR mortgage loans and sold those loans in the secondary market. The amount of net revenue on mortgage banking activities was a function of mortgage loans originated for sale and the fair value adjustments of these loans and related derivatives. Net revenue on mortgage banking activities included mark to market pricing adjustments on loan commitments and forward sales contracts, and initial capitalized value of MSRs.

Noninterest income from discontinued operations was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $113.1 million, or 65.3 percent, from $173.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in loan servicing income and net revenue on mortgage banking activities, partially offset by a net gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decreases in loan servicing income and net revenue on mortgage banking activities were mainly due to the discontinued operations of mortgage banking activities. The Company originated conforming SFR mortgage loans of $1.53 billion and $5.14 billion, respectively, and sold $1.88 billion and $5.13 billion, respectively, in the secondary market during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Noninterest expense from discontinued operations was $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $79.5 million, or 57.0 percent, from $139.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to the discontinued operations of mortgage banking activities, partially offset by a restructuring expense of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the sale of Banc Home Loans division, the Company restructured certain aspects of its infrastructure and back office operations by realigning back office staffing and amending certain system contracts.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015
Net income from discontinued operations was $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.7 million, or 36.9 percent, from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Diluted earnings from discontinued operations per total common share were $0.60 and $0.56 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Interest income from discontinued operations was $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.6 million, or 20.7 percent, from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase in average balance of loans held-for-sale of discontinued operations.
Noninterest income from discontinued operations was $173.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $28.8 million, or 19.9 percent, from $144.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to increases in loan servicing income and net revenue on mortgage banking activities. The increase in loan servicing income was mainly due to an increase in servicing fees from the increased volume of loans sold with servicing retained, partially offset by an increase in losses on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. The increase in net revenue on mortgage banking activities was mainly due to increased originations and sales of conforming SFR mortgage loans. The Company originated conforming SFR mortgage loans of $5.14 billion and $4.39 billion, respectively, and sold $5.13 billion and $4.30 billion, respectively, in the secondary market during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Noninterest expense from discontinued operations was $139.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $17.6 million, or 14.4 percent, from $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, outside service fees, data processing and advertising. These increases were mainly due to the expansion of the Company's mortgage banking activities during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Investment Securities
The primary goal of our investment securities portfolio is to provide a relatively stable source of interest income while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Certain investment securities provide a source of liquidity as collateral for FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window capacity, repurchase agreements and for certain public deposits.

The Company did not have securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated its securities held-to-maturity and determined that certain securities no longer adhered to the Company’s strategic focus and could be sold or reinvested to potentially improve the Company’s liquidity position or duration profile. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity. As a result, the Company transferred all $740.9 million of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, which resulted in a pre-tax increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $22.0 million at the time of the transfer, June 30, 2017. Due to the transfer, the Company’s ability to assert that it has both the intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity will be limited for the foreseeable future.
Securities available-for-sale were $2.58 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $194.0 million, or 8.1 percent, from $2.38 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to purchases of $962.4 million and transfers from securities held-to-maturity of $740.9 million, partially offset by sales of $972.2 million, principal payments of $43.9 million, and calls and pay-offs of $519.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Securities available-for-sale had a net unrealized gain of $8.1 million at December 31, 2017 and a net unrealized loss of $15.5 million at December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company continued to reposition its securities available-for-sale portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling certain longer-duration and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities.
CLOs totaled $1.69 billion and $1.73 billion, respectively, on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2017 and 2016. CLOs are floating rate debt securities backed by pools of senior secured commercial loans to a diverse group of companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Underlying loans are generally secured by a company’s assets such as inventory, equipment, property, and/or real estate. CLOs are structured to diversify exposure to a broad sector of industries. The payments on these commercial loans support interest and principal on the CLOs across classes that range from AAA rated to equity tranches.
The Company believes that its CLO portfolio, consisting entirely of variable rate securities, supports the Company’s interest rate risk management strategy by lowering the extension risk and duration risk inherent to certain fixed rate investment securities. At December 31, 2017, the Company owned AAA and AA rated CLOs and did not own CLOs rated below AA. As all CLOs are also rated above investment grade credit ratings and were diversified across issuers, the Company believes that these CLOs enhance the Company's liquidity position. The Company also maintains pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing review processes by a dedicated credit administration team. The ongoing review process includes monitoring of performance factors including external credit ratings, collateralization levels, collateral concentration levels and other performance factors. The Company only acquires CLOs that it believes are Volcker Rule compliant.
The Company did not record OTTI for investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. The Company monitors its securities portfolio to ensure it has adequate credit support. As of December 31, 2017, the Company believed there was no OTTI and did not have the intent to sell these securities and, for securities with fair value below amortized cost at December 31, 2017. The Company considers the lowest credit rating for identification of potential OTTI. As of December 31, 2017, all of the Company's investment securities in an unrealized loss position received an investment grade credit rating.

Loans Held-for-Sale
Total loans held-for-sale, including both continuing and discontinued operations, totaled $105.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $598.9 million, or 85.0 percent, from $704.7 million at December 31, 2016. Loans held-for-sale consisted of two components: loans held-for-sale carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale carried at lower of cost or fair value.
Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value are mainly conforming SFR mortgage loans originated, repurchased loans that were previously sold, as well as loans sold to GNMA that are subject to a repurchase option through the Company's mortgage banking activities. Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value, including both continuing and discontinued operations, were $105.3 million and $417.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease was mainly due to the discontinued operations of mortgage banking activities. The Company sold $1.90 billion, originated $1.54 billion and repurchased $31.9 million of loans held-for-sale at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment, and determined that the sale of Mortgage Banking segment met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value related to the Banc Home Loans division were included in Assets of Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Such loans totaled $38.7 million and $406.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value are mainly non-conforming jumbo mortgage loans and SBA loans. Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value, including both continuing and discontinued operations, were $466 thousand and $287.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The $287.2 million, or 99.8 percent, decrease was due mainly to sales of $851.4 million, loans transferred to loans and leases receivable of $88.6 million, and paydowns and amortization of $29.4 million, partially offset by originations of $88.3 million and loans transferred from loans and leases receivable of $594.0 million.
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company transferred seasoned SFR mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal and aggregate carrying value of $168.3 million and $147.9 million, respectively, to loans held-for-sale as it no longer had the intent to hold them for the foreseeable future. The Company transferred these loans at lower of cost or fair value and recorded a charge-off of $1.8 million against its ALLL. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, all of the transferred seasoned SFR mortgage loans were sold and the Company recognized a gain on sale of loans of $4.7 million.

Total loans and leases were $6.66 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $624.7 million, or 10.4 percent, from $6.03 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to increases in multifamily loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction loans, and SBA loans, partially offset by decreases in SFR mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, other consumer loans, and lease financing. The increases in multifamily loans, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans were mainly due to increased originations. The decrease in SFR mortgage loans was mainly due to loans transferred to loans held-for-sale of $450.6 million, partially offset by increased originations. See "Loan and Lease Originations, Purchases and Repayments" for the origination detail per loan and lease category.
The decreases in lease financing during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were mainly due to the sale of the Commercial Equipment Finance business unit in 2016 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Seasoned SFR Mortgage Loan Pools
The Company did not have any outstanding seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the total unpaid principal balance and carrying value of the seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools were $177.1 million and $155.2 million, respectively. At the time of purchase, the Company determined that certain of these loans reflected credit quality deterioration since origination and it was probable that all contractually required payments would not be collected (Purchased Credit Impaired Loans, or PCI loans). Total unpaid principal balance and carrying value of PCI loans included in these pools were $153.9 million and $133.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company transferred all of its seasoned SFR mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value of $168.3 million and $147.9 million, respectively, to loans held-for-sale as it no longer had the intent to hold them for the foreseeable future. The Company transferred these loans at lower of cost or fair value and recorded a charge-off of $1.8 million against its ALLL at the time of transfer. This transfer included PCI loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value of $147.5 million and $128.4 million, respectively, and a related fair value adjustment of $274 thousand. All of these transferred loans were sold during the year ended December 31, 2017. On the date of sale settlement, the aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value were $165.7 million and $144.2 million, respectively, and the Company recognized a gain on sale of $4.7 million. The Company sold seasoned SFR mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value of $766.0 million and $707.4 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016, and $232.4 million and $198.4 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015. From these sales, the Company recognized gain on sale of $24.7 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
The Company did not purchase any seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company completed one seasoned SFR mortgage loan pool acquisition with unpaid principal balances and fair values of $103.8 million and $91.0 million, respectively, at the acquisition date. The Company determined that all of the loans in this seasoned SFR mortgage loan acquisition reflected credit quality deterioration since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company completed seven seasoned SFR mortgage loan pool acquisitions with unpaid principal balances and fair values of $622.1 million and $578.7 million, respectively, at the respective acquisition dates. The Company determined that certain loans in these seasoned SFR mortgage loan acquisitions reflected credit quality deterioration since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. The unpaid principal balances and fair values of PCI loans in these transactions, at the respective acquisition dates, were $571.2 million and $529.2 million, respectively.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Portfolio
The Company’s non-traditional mortgage (NTM) portfolio is comprised of three interest only products: Green Loans, fixed or adjustable rate hybrid interest only rate mortgage (Interest Only) loans and a small number of additional loans with the potential for negative amortization. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the NTM loans totaled $806.9 million, or 12.1 percent of total loans and leases, and $885.1 million, or 14.7 percent of total loans and leases, respectively. Total NTM portfolio decreased by $78.2 million, or 8.8 percent, during the period. The following table presents the composition of the NTM portfolio as of the dates indicated:

The initial credit guidelines for the NTM portfolio were established based on borrower Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, LTV ratio, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Additionally, from an ongoing credit risk management perspective, the Company has determined the most significant performance indicators for NTMs to be LTV ratios and FICO scores. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs loan reviews of the NTM loan portfolio, which includes refreshing FICO scores on the Green Loans and HELOCs and ordering third party automated valuation models (AVMs) to confirm collateral values.

Green Loans
The Company discontinued origination of Green Loans in 2011. Green Loans are SFR first and second mortgage lines of credit with a linked checking account that allows all types of deposits and withdrawals to be performed. The loans are generally interest only with a 15 year balloon payment due at maturity. The Company initiated the Green Loan products in 2005 and proactively refined underwriting and credit management practices and credit guidelines in response to changing economic environments, competitive conditions and portfolio performance. The Company continues to manage credit risk, to the extent possible, throughout the borrower’s credit cycle.
At December 31, 2017, Green Loans totaled $85.8 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 5.8 percent from $91.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to reductions in principal balance and payoffs. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the Company’s Green Loans were non-performing. As a result of their unique payment feature, Green Loans possess higher credit risk due to the potential of negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the Company’s loan terms and underwriting standards, including its policies on LTV ratios and the Company’s contractual ability to curtail loans when the value of underlying collateral declines.
The Green Loans are similar to HELOCs in that they are collateralized primarily by the equity in the borrower's home. However, some Green Loans are subject to differences from HELOCs relating to certain characteristics including one-action laws. Similar to Green Loans, HELOCs allow the borrower to draw down on the credit line based on an established loan amount for a period of time, typically 10 years, requiring an interest only payment with an option to pay principal at any time. A typical HELOC provides that at the end of the term the borrower can continue to make monthly principal and interest payments based on the loan balance until the maturity date. The Green Loan is an interest only loan with a maturity of 15 years at which time the loan comes due and payable with a balloon payment due at maturity. The unique payment structure also differs from a traditional HELOC in that payments are made through the direct linkage of a personal checking account to the loan through a nightly sweep of funds into the Green Loan Account. This reduces any outstanding balance on the loan by the total amount deposited into the checking account. As a result, every time a deposit is made, effectively a payment to the Green Loan is made. HELOCs typically do not cause the loan to be paid down by a borrower’s depositing of funds into their checking account at the same bank.
Credit guidelines for Green Loans were established based on borrower FICO scores, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Property types include single family residences and second trust deeds where the Company owned the first liens, owner occupied as well as non-owner occupied properties. The Company utilized its underwriting guidelines for first liens to underwrite the Green Loan secured by second trust deeds as if the combined loans were a single Green Loan. For all Green Loans, the loan income was underwritten using either full income documentation or alternative income documentation.
Interest Only Loans
Interest only loans are primarily SFR mortgage loans with payment features that allow interest only payment in initial periods before converting to a fully amortizing loan. As of December 31, 2017, Interest only loans decreased by $66.9 million, or 8.5 percent, to $717.5 million from $784.4 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to paydowns and amortization of $154.7 million and loans transferred to held-for-sale of $110.6 million, partially offset by originations of $160.9 million and loans transferred from held-for-sale of $37.4 million. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $1.2 million and $467 thousand of the Interest only loans were non-performing, respectively.
Loans with the Potential for Negative Amortization
The Company discontinued origination of negative amortization loans in 2007. Negative amortization loans decreased by $6.1 million, or 62.3 percent, to $3.7 million as of December 31, 2017 from $9.8 million as of December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the loans with the potential for negative amortization were non-performing. These loans pose a potentially higher credit risk because of the lack of principal amortization and potential for negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the loan terms and underwriting standards, including the Company’s policies on LTV ratios.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Management
The Company performs detailed reviews of collateral values on loans collateralized by residential real property included in its NTM portfolio based on appraisals or estimates from third party AVMs to analyze property value trends periodically. AVMs are used to identify loans that have experienced potential collateral deterioration. Once a loan has been identified that may have experienced collateral deterioration, the Company will obtain updated drive by or full appraisals in order to confirm the valuation. This information is used to update key monitoring metrics such as LTV ratios. Additionally, FICO scores are obtained in conjunction with the collateral analysis. In addition to LTV ratios and FICO scores, the Company evaluates the portfolio on a specific loan basis through delinquency and portfolio charge-offs to determine whether any risk mitigation or portfolio management actions are warranted. The borrowers may be contacted as necessary to discuss material changes in loan performance or credit metrics.
The Company’s risk management policy and credit monitoring includes reviewing delinquency, FICO scores, and LTV ratios on the NTM loan portfolio. The Company also continuously monitors market conditions for our geographic lending areas. The Company has determined that the most significant performance indicators for NTM are LTV ratios and FICO scores. The loan review provides an effective method of identifying borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulty before they fail to make a loan payment. Upon receipt of the updated FICO scores, an exception report is run to identify loans with a decrease in FICO score of 10 percent or more and a resulting FICO score of 620 or less. The loans are then further analyzed to determine if the risk rating should be downgraded, which may require an increase in the ALLL the Company needs to establish for potential losses. A report is prepared and regularly monitored.
On the interest only loans, the Company projects future payment changes to determine if there will be an increase in payment of 3.50 percent or greater and then monitors the loans for possible delinquencies. The individual loans are monitored for possible downgrading of risk rating, and trends within the portfolio are identified that could affect other interest only loans scheduled for payment changes in the near future.
As these loans are revolving lines of credit, the Company, based on the loan agreement and loan covenants of the particular loan, as well as applicable rules and regulations, could suspend the borrowing privileges or reduce the credit limit at any time the Company reasonably believes that the borrower will be unable to fulfill their repayment obligations under the agreement or certain other conditions are met. In many cases, the decrease in FICO score is the first red flag that the borrower may have difficulty in making their future payment obligations.
As a result, the Company proactively manages the portfolio by performing a detailed analysis with emphasis on the non-traditional mortgage portfolio. The Company’s Internal Asset Review Committee (IARC) conducts regular meetings to review the loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful and determines whether suspension or reduction in credit limit is warranted. If the line has been suspended and the borrower would like to have their credit privileges reinstated, they would need to provide updated financials showing their ability to meet their payment obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made no curtailment in available commitments on Green Loans.
Consumer and NTM loans may entail greater risk than do traditional SFR mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles and recreational vehicles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a consumer and NTM loan are more dependent on the borrower‘s continued financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy.
For additional information regarding NTMs, see "Non-Traditional Mortgage Loans" under Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Traditional loans and leases that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $21.1 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 18.5 percent, from $25.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in construction, SFR mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by increases in commercial and industrial and SBA loans.
The decrease in SFR mortgage loan delinquencies in 2017 and 2016 was mainly due to sales of SFR mortgage loan pools during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The total amount that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days in seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools was $1.9 million, $12.2 million, $22.9 million and $28.1 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company did not have any outstanding seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools at December 31, 2017.

The increase in non-accrual other consumer loans in 2017 was mainly due to one loan, which was individually evaluated for impairment, with a carrying value of $4.4 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in non-accrual loans in 2016 was mainly due to sales of non-accrual loans and leases and seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2016.
With respect to loans that were on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2017, the gross interest income that would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 had such loans and leases been current in accordance with their original terms and been outstanding throughout the year ended December 31, 2017 (or since origination, if held for part of the year ended December 31, 2017), was $746 thousand. The amount of interest income on such loans that was included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $70 thousand.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Loans that the Company modifies or restructures where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and makes a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, concessions to the outstanding loan balances are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and the Company is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had 12 and 18 loans, respectively, with an aggregate balance of $8.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively, classified as TDRs. When a loan becomes a TDR the Company ceases accruing interest, and classifies it as non-accrual until the borrower demonstrates that the loan is again performing.
At December 31, 2017, of the 12 loans classified as TDRs, 11 loans totaling $5.6 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status. At December 31, 2016, all of the 18 loans classified as TDRs were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms.

Risk Ratings
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and leases and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve or charge-off is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allocation allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the Board of Directors. General allocation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allocation allowance for losses equal to 100 percent of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its specific allocation allowances is subject to review by the OCC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allocation allowances.
In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with policies for the Bank's classification of assets, the Bank regularly reviews the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management’s review of assets, at December 31, 2017, the Company had classified assets (including OREO) totaling $54.8 million. The total amount classified represented 0.53 percent of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2017.
When accrual of income on a pool of PCI loans with common risk characteristics is appropriate in accordance with ASC 310-30, individual loans in those pools are not risk-rated. The credit criteria evaluated are LTV ratios, delinquency, and actual cash flows versus expected cash flows of the loan pools. The Company had no pools of PCI loans at December 31, 2017.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The Company maintains an ALLL to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. The ALLL is based on ongoing assessment of the estimated probable losses presently inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management considers the types of loans and leases and the amount of loans and leases in the portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This methodology takes into account many factors, including the Company’s own historical and peer loss trends, loan and lease-level credit quality ratings, loan and lease specific attributes along with a review of various credit metrics and trends. The process involves subjective as well as complex judgments. In addition, the Company uses adjustments for numerous factors including those found in the federal banking agencies' joint Interagency Policy Statement on ALLL, which include current economic conditions, loan and lease seasoning, underwriting experience, and collateral value changes among others. The Company evaluates all impaired loans and leases individually using guidance from ASC 310 primarily through the evaluation of cash flows or collateral values. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company, as part of its continuous evaluation of the ALLL methodology and assumptions, determined that it was appropriate to change from a rolling 28-quarter look-back period to a cumulative look-back period with a pegged (fixed) starting point (the quarter ended March 31, 2008). The Company believes that an extended period of observed credit loss stability warranted the review of a longer historical period that captured a full credit cycle. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, the Company's look-back period was extended to 39-quarters. The Company further enhanced the methodology in the areas of qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation during the second quarter of 2017, and performed an annual update of the loss emergence period during the third quarter of 2017. These updates were designed to be systematic, transparent, and repeatable. The annual update of the loss emergence period resulted in an increase of $1.9 million in the ALLL at September 30, 2017. The updates on qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation did not have a material impact.
The Company had acquired PCI loans through business combinations and purchases of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools. The Company recognized a provision for loan and lease losses when there is further credit deterioration in these loans resulting in a decrease in the cash flows expected to be collected. On a quarterly basis, the Company re-forecasted its expected cash flows for the PCI loans. The ALLL for PCI loans reflects a decrease in expected cash flows compared to those previously estimated. At December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any outstanding PCI loans. The impairment reserve for PCI loans at December 31, 2016 was $104 thousand.
At December 31, 2017, total ALLL was $49.3 million or 0.74 percent of total loans and leases, as compared to $40.4 million, or 0.67 percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2016. The increase in ALLL for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly due to methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2017, such as extension of look-back period, enhancements of qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation, and annual update of the loss emergence period. The ALLL for loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2017 was $48.1 million, which represented 0.73 percent of the attributable loans and leases, as compared to $40.1 million, or 0.68 percent of attributable loans and leases at December 31, 2016. The ALLL for loans individually evaluated for impairment was $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $243 thousand at December 31, 2016. The Company held no unallocated ALLL at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company provided $13.7 million to its provision for loan and lease losses during the year ended December 31, 2017, related primarily to new commercial and industrial and multifamily loan production.

The increase in ALLL on commercial and industrial loans was mainly due to an increased total commercial and industrial loan balance, an increased loss rate from an annual update of the loss emergence period, and an increased qualitative allowance related to recent classified loan trends.

Premises and equipment, net
Premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation totaled $135.7 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $7.9 million, or 5.5 percent, from $143.6 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to depreciation, disposals, and impairments of certain assets, partially offset by increased building improvements associated with additional facilities resulting from the purchase of a new building in 2015. The Company recognized depreciation expense of $12.4 million, $11.7 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.0 million and $595 thousand, respectively, on previously capitalized software projects. There were no impairment losses on premises, equipment, and capital leases for the year ended December 31, 2015.
For additional information, see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Servicing Rights
Total mortgage and SBA servicing rights were $33.7 million and $77.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of the MSRs amounted to $31.9 million and $76.1 million and the amortized cost of the SBA servicing rights was $1.9 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company retains servicing rights from certain sales of SFR mortgage loans and SBA loans. The aggregate principal balance of the loans underlying total MSRs and SBA servicing rights was $3.94 billion and $101.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and $7.58 billion and $74.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The recorded amount of the MSR and SBA servicing rights as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans we are servicing was 0.81 percent and 1.84 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2017 as compared to 1.00 percent and 2.02 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a flow-agreement establishing general terms for the purchase and sale to a third party MSR investor in connection with residential mortgage loan sales to GSEs. The flow-agreement allowed the Company to sell its MSRs to a third party MSR investor contemporaneous with the Company’s sales of its servicing retained residential mortgages to the GSEs. Accordingly, entering into the flow-agreement reduced the impact of volatility associated with the Company's MSRs by allowing the Company to sell its MSRs immediately, thus reducing the Company's exposure to market and other conditions. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company suspended sales of MSRs under the flow-agreement. The Company does not expect to resume sales under the flow-agreement as it has discontinued its Mortgage Banking segment operations.
The Company sold $37.8 million of MSRs as a part of discontinued operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and classified MSRs of $29.8 million as held-for-sale at December 31, 2017.
For additional information, see Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Real Estate Owned
OREO totaled $1.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $706 thousand, or 28.2 percent, from $2.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in OREO relates to OREO property sales of $3.6 million and a $236 thousand increase in the OREO valuation allowance, partially offset by new foreclosures of $3.1 million

Goodwill and other intangible assets
The Company had goodwill of $37.1 million and $39.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Goodwill was allocated between the Commercial Banking and Mortgage Banking segments using a relative fair value approach in connection with the Company's realignment of segment reporting at December 31, 2014. The carrying values of goodwill allocated to the reportable segments were $37.1 million and $2.1 million to the Commercial Banking segment and Mortgage Banking segment, respectively, at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company discontinued its mortgage banking operations and wrote off goodwill of $2.1 million, which was previously allocated to its Mortgage Banking segment, against the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.
The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment as of August 31 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2017 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
The Company had core deposit intangibles of $9.4 million at December 31, 2017. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for core deposit intangibles was approximately 6.0 years.
The Company recorded impairment on intangible assets of $336 thousand, $690 thousand, and $258 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also wrote off a customer relationship intangible of $246 thousand and a trade name intangible of $90 thousand related to RenovationReady. RenovationReady was acquired in 2014 and provided specialized loan services to financial institutions and mortgage bankers that originate agency eligible residential renovation and construction loan products. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company ceased to use the CS Financial trade name and wrote off the related trade name intangible of $690 thousand. CS Financial is a mortgage banking firm, which is the Bank's wholly owned subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company wrote off a portion of core deposit intangibles on noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts acquired through the BPNA Branch Acquisition of $258 thousand, as these deposits were transferred in connection with the sale of two branches to AUB.

Alternative Energy Partnerships
The following table presents the activity related to the Company’s investment in alternative energy partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ------- - ------

Balance at end of period $ 48,826 $ 25,639
Unfunded equity commitments $ 50,084 $ 42,659

The Company’s investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $38.2 million, offset by $6.7 million of tax expenses from tax basis reduction in connection with new equipment being placed into service as well as income tax benefits of $12.1 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 39.45 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $33.4 million, offset by $5.8 million of tax expense from tax basis reduction as well as income tax benefits of $12.9 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 40.91 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.

Deposits
Total deposits were $7.29 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.85 billion, or 20.2 percent, from $9.14 billion at December 31, 2016. The Company reduced its reliance on brokered and other high-rate and high-volatility deposits by replacing them with more predictable advances from FHLB with the goal of increasing core deposits to fund new loan originations. Brokered deposits were $1.46 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $791.6 million, or 35.2 percent, from $2.25 billion at December 31, 2016. Brokered deposits represented 14.1 percent and 20.4 percent of total assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Borrowings
The Company utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, as a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Company also maintains additional borrowing availabilities from Federal Reserve Discount Window and unsecured federal funds lines of credit.
FHLB advances totaled $1.70 billion and $490.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company did not have any outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2017 or 2016. On June 30, 2017, the Company voluntarily terminated a line of credit of $75.0 million that it maintained at Banc of California, Inc. with an unaffiliated financial institution. The line had a maturity date of July 17, 2017. The Company had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the line, which were repaid in connection with the termination of the line.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
The Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks. The probability of usage of the unfunded loan commitments and credit risk factors are determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure. Reserve for unfunded loan commitments totaled $3.7 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million, or 55.8 percent, from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher balances in unfunded loan commitments. The following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated:

--------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- --- ---- ----- --- - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2015

Balance at end of period $ 3,716 $ 2,385 $ 2,067

Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans
When the Company sells residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, the Company makes customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, such as the manner of origination, the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided. Typically, these representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan. If a defect in the origination process is identified, the Company may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. If there are no such defects, generally the Company has no liability to the purchaser for losses it may incur on such loan. In addition, the Company has the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from Ginnie Mae pools for which the Company is the servicer and issuer of the pool. The Company maintains a reserve for losses on repurchased loans to account for the expected losses related to loans the Company might be required to repurchase (or the indemnity payments the Company may have to make to purchasers). The reserve takes into account both the estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period, as well as adjustments to the previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold. In each case, these estimates are based on the most recent data available, including data from third parties, regarding demand for loan repurchases, actual loan repurchases, and actual credit losses on repurchased loans, among other factors.
Reserve for loss on repurchased loans totaled $6.3 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 20.9 percent, from $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. Provisions added to the reserve for loss on repurchased loans are initially recorded against net revenue on mortgage banking activities at the time of sale, and any subsequent increase or decrease in the provision is then recorded under noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to provision for loan repurchases. Initial provisions for loan repurchases were $1.6 million, $3.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and subsequent changes in the prevision were $(1.8) million, $(3.4) million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
The Company believes that all repurchase demands received were adequately reserved at December 31, 2017. For additional information, see Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity Management
The Company is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Historically, the Company has maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows, and dividend payments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
Banc of California, N.A.
The Bank's liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale, is a product of its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, payments and maturities of outstanding loans and investment securities; and other short-term investments and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and investment securities, and maturing investment securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. In addition, the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. The Bank also generates cash through borrowings. The Bank mainly utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, as a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Bank also has the ability to obtain brokered deposits and collect deposits through the wholesale and treasury operations. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Any excess liquidity is typically invested in federal funds or investment securities. On a longer-term basis, the Bank maintains a strategy of investing in various lending products. The Bank uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing loan and other commitments, and to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals.
Banc of California, Inc.
The primary sources of funds for Banc of California, Inc., on a stand-alone holding company basis, are dividends and intercompany tax payments from the Bank, outside borrowing, and its ability to raise capital and issue debt securities. Dividends from the Bank are largely dependent upon the Bank's earnings and are subject to restrictions under the certain regulations that limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of a bank to make capital distributions, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, and certain other items. Generally, a well-capitalized bank may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100 percent of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years without prior OCC approval. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $276.9 million available to pay dividends to Banc of California, Inc. without prior OCC approval. However, any dividend granted by the Bank would be limited by the need to maintain its well capitalized status plus the capital buffer in order to avoid additional dividend restrictions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bank paid dividends of $18.0 million to Banc of California, Inc. At December 31, 2017, Banc of California, Inc. had $40.5 million in cash, all of which was on deposit at the Bank.
On a consolidated basis, the Company maintained $387.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was 3.8 percent of total assets at December 31, 2017. The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $51.8 million, or 11.8 percent, from $439.5 million, or 4.0 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in deposits and other borrowings, partially offset by an increase in advances from FHLB and a decrease in securities. The Company reduced the reliance on brokered and other high-rate and high-volatility deposits by replacing them with more predictable advances from FHLB with the goal of increasing core deposits to fund new loan origination. The Company also strategically decreased its securities portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration by selling longer-duration and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities. All of these strategic actions were taken in order to expand core lending activities across the organization, while reducing risk on the Company's balance sheet.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had available unused secured borrowing capacities of $873.1 million from FHLB and $63.2 million from Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as $210.0 million from unused unsecured federal funds lines of credit. The Company also maintained repurchase agreements and had no outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements at December 31, 2017. Availabilities and terms on repurchase agreements are subject to the counterparties' discretion and pledging additional investment securities. The Company had unpledged securities available-for-sale of $2.01 billion at December 31, 2017. On June 30, 2017, the Company voluntarily terminated a line of credit of $75.0 million that was maintained at Banc of California, Inc. with an unaffiliated financial institution. The line originally had a maturity date of July 17, 2017. The Company had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the line, which were repaid in connection with the termination of the line.
The Company believes that its liquidity sources are stable and are adequate to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2017, the Company believes that there are no events, uncertainties, material commitments, or capital expenditures that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity position.

Stockholders’ Equity
Total stockholders’ equity totaled $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $32.1 million, or 3.3 percent, from $980.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due mainly to the net income of $57.7 million and a $14.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by cash dividends for common stock of $25.9 million and cash dividends for preferred stock of $20.5 million. For additional information, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In order to maintain adequate levels of capital, the Company continuously assesses projected sources and uses of capital to support projected asset growth, operating needs and credit risk. The Company considers, among other things, earnings generated from operations and access to capital from financial markets. In addition, the Company performs capital stress tests on an annual basis to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy on the Company's capital base.
Regulatory Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines that are established by the Federal banking regulators. In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel III and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule strengthens the definition of regulatory capital, increases risk-based capital requirements, makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusts the prompt corrective action thresholds. The Company and the Bank became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015 and certain provisions of the new rule will be phased in through 2019. For additional information on BASEL III capital rules, see Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of dates indicated:

---------------------------------- ------------------------ - ---------------------- ----- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------ - ----- -

 Banc of California, Inc. Banc of California, NA Minimum Regulatory Requirements Well-Capitalized Requirements (Bank)
December 31, 2017
Total risk-based capital ratio 14.56 % 16.56 % 8.00 % 10.00 %
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 13.79 % 15.78 % 6.00 % 8.00 %
Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 9.92 % 15.78 % 4.50 % 6.50 %
Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.39 % 10.67 % 4.00 % 5.00 %
December 31, 2016
Total risk-based capital ratio 13.70 % 14.73 % 8.00 % 10.00 %
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 13.22 % 14.12 % 6.00 % 8.00 %
Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 9.44 % 14.12 % 4.50 % 6.50 %
Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.17 % 8.71 % 4.00 % 5.00 %

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly-traded bank holding companies with assets of $10 billion or more to perform capital stress testing and establish a risk committee responsible for enterprise-wide risk management practices, comprised of independent directors, including one risk management expert. These provisions become applicable if the average of the total consolidated assets of the bank holding company, as reported in its quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies, for the four most recent consecutive quarters exceed $10 billion. The “Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests” or “DFAST” stress tests are designed to determine whether the capital planning of the Company, assessment of its capital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect it and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. As the Company exceeded the $10 billion threshold for four consecutive quarters during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company became subject to the DFAST regime on January 1, 2018. The Company must establish adequate internal controls, documentation, policies and procedures to ensure the annual stress test adequately meets these objectives. The board of directors of the Company must review the Company’s policies and procedures at least annually. The Company is required to report the results of its annual stress tests to the OCC and the Federal Reserve, publicly disclose the results and consider the results of the Company’s stress tests as part of its capital planning and risk management practices.

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...

NOTE 25. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spin-Off of Delphi Technologies On December 4, 2017, the Company completed the Separation of its former Powertrain Systems segment by distributing to Aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ("Delphi Technologies"), a public limited company formed to hold the spun-off business. To effect the Separation, the Company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies for every three Aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of November 22, 2017, the record date for the distribution. Shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies. Following the Separation, Delphi Technologies is now an independent public company. Aptiv did not retain any equity or other interests in Delphi Technologies. On December 4, 2017, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company transferred to Delphi Technologies the assets and liabilities that comprised Delphi Technologies' business. The Company received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies in connection with the Separation. Delphi Technologies financed this dividend through the issuance of approximately $1.55 billion of debt, consisting of a senior secured five-year $750 million term loan facility that was issued upon the spin-off and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 that were issued in September 2017 (collectively, the "Delphi Technologies Debt"). In connection with the Separation, the Delphi Technologies Debt was transferred to Delphi Technologies and is no longer reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also in connection with the Separation, the Company received $180 million in cash from Delphi Technologies pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement. The requirements for the presentation of Delphi Technologies as a discontinued operation were met when the Se...

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

NOTE 25. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spin-Off of Delphi Technologies On December 4, 2017, the Company completed the Separation of its former Powertrain Systems segment by distributing to Aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ("Delphi Technologies"), a public limited company formed to hold the spun-off business. To effect the Separation, the Company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies for every three Aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of November 22, 2017, the record date for the distribution. Shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies. Following the Separation, Delphi Technologies is now an independent public company. Aptiv did not retain any equity or other interests in Delphi Technologies. On December 4, 2017, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company transferred to Delphi Technologies the assets and liabilities that comprised Delphi Technologies' business. The Company received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies in connection with the Separation. Delphi Technologies financed this dividend through the issuance of approximately $1.55 billion of debt, consisting of a senior secured five-year $750 million term loan facility that was issued upon the spin-off and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 that were issued in September 2017 (collectively, the "Delphi Technologies Debt"). In connection with the Separation, the Delphi Technologies Debt was transferred to Delphi Technologies and is no longer reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also in connection with the Separation, the Company received $180 million in cash from Delphi Technologies pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement. The requirements for the presentation of Delphi Technologies as a discontinued operation were met when the Se...

The increase was due mainly to additional compensation expense from an increase in the number of full-time employees, and increases in direct loan origination cost and stock-based compensation expense.
Occupancy and equipment expenses were $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.7 million, or 25.3 percent, from $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to increased building and maintenance costs associated with additional facilities resulting from the new building purchased in 2015.
Professional fees were $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $10.9 million, or 55.8 percent, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Traditional loans and leases that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $21.1 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 18.5 percent, from $25.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in construction, SFR mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by increases in commercial and industrial and SBA loans.
The decrease in SFR mortgage loan delinquencies in 2017 and 2016 was mainly due to sales of SFR mortgage loan pools during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The total amount that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days in seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools was $1.9 million, $12.2 million, $22.9 million and $28.1 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The decrease in non-accrual loans in 2016 was mainly due to sales of non-accrual loans and leases and seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2016.
With respect to loans that were on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2017, the gross interest income that would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 had such loans and leases been current in accordance with their original terms and been outstanding throughout the year ended December 31, 2017 (or since origination, if held for part of the year ended December 31, 2017), was $746 thousand.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
Provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to operations at a level required to reflect incurred credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Company recorded $13.7 million, $5.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to its provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly due to methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2017, such as an extension of the look-back period, refined measurement of qualitative adjustments, reduced loan segmentation, and an annual update of the loss emergence period, as well as the growth in the loan and lease portfolio. The decrease in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly due to the improved asset quality, which resulted in low net charge-offs and declining quantitative loss rates and qualitative factors in line with the current economic and business environment.

The initial credit guidelines for the NTM portfolio were established based on borrower Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, LTV ratio, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Additionally, from an ongoing credit risk management perspective, the Company has determined the most significant performance indicators for NTMs to be LTV ratios and FICO scores. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs loan reviews of the NTM loan portfolio, which includes refreshing FICO scores on the Green Loans and HELOCs and ordering third party automated valuation models (AVMs) to confirm collateral values.

Green Loans
The Company discontinued origination of Green Loans in 2011. Green Loans are SFR first and second mortgage lines of credit with a linked checking account that and proactively refined underwriting and credit management practices and credit guidelines in response to changing economic environments, competitive conditions and portfolio performance. The Company continues to manage credit risk, to the extent possible, throughout the borrower’s credit cycle.
At December 31, 2017, Green Loans totaled $85.8 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 5.8 percent from $91.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to reductions in principal balance and payoffs. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the Company’s Green Loans were non-performing. As a result of their unique payment feature, Green Loans possess higher credit risk due to the potential of negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the Company’s loan terms and underwriting standards, including its policies on LTV ratios and the Company’s contractual ability to curtail loans when the value of underlying collateral declines.
The Green Loans are similar to HELOCs in that they are collateralized primarily by the equity in the borrower']:

['s wholly owned subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company wrote off a portion of core deposit intangibles on noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts acquired through the BPNA Branch Acquisition of $258 thousand, as these deposits were transferred in connection with the sale of two branches to AUB.

Alternative Energy Partnerships
The following table presents the activity related to the Company’s investment in alternative energy partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ------- - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) 2017 2016
Balance at beginning of period $ 25,639 $ —
New funding 55,377 57,341
Cash distribution from investments (1,404 ) (192 )
Loss on investments using HLBV method (30,786 ) (31,510 )
Balance at end of period $ 48,826 $ 25,639
Unfunded equity commitments $ 50,084 $ 42,659

The Company’s investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $38.2 million, offset by $6.7 million of tax expenses from tax basis reduction in connection with new equipment being placed into service as well as income tax benefits of $12.1 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 39.45 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $33.4 million, offset by $5.8 million of tax expense from tax basis reduction as well as income tax benefits of $12.9 application. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.
