Liquidity and Capital Resources
ComEd’s business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. ComEd’s capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper or credit facility borrowings. ComEd’s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. At December 31, 2017, ComEd had access to a revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $1 billion.
See EXELON CORPORATION — Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 13 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Capital resources are used primarily to fund ComEd’s capital requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, and contributions to Exelon’s pension plans. Additionally, ComEd operates in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time.
