Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

			The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I of this Form 10‑K as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8— “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10‑K. Our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which are beyond our control. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described in this Annual Report under “Cautionary Note regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A-- “Risk Factors.” Accordingly, past results and trends should not be used by investors to anticipate future results or trends.

 Executive Summary

			Helmerich & Payne, Inc. provides performance-driven drilling services and technologies that are intended to make hydrocarbon recovery safer and more economical for oil and gas exploration and production companies. As of September 30, 2018, our drilling rig fleet included a total of 390 drilling rigs. Our contract drilling segments consist of the U.S. Land segment with 350 rigs, the Offshore segment with 8 offshore platform rigs and the International Land segment with 32 rigs as of September 30, 2018. At the close of fiscal year 2018, we had 259 contracted rigs, of which 153 were under a  fixed term contract and 106 were working well-to-well, compared to 218 contracted rigs at the same time during the prior year. As the U.S. land drilling industry recovered from an all-time low of approximately 380 active rigs in the summer of 2016 to over 1,000 rigs as of September 30, 2018, we led the way in reactivating rigs in the United States and gained significant market share in the process. We believe that our success during this time frame is validation of the capabilities of our land drilling fleet and our decisions during the downturn to prepare for an eventual improvement in the business, and our ability to deliver best-in-class field performance and customer satisfaction. Our long-term strategy remains focused on innovation, technology, safety, operational excellence and reliability.  As we move forward, we believe that our advanced uniform rig fleet, financial strength, long term contract backlog and strong customer and employee base position us very well to take advantage of future opportunities.

 Market Outlook

			Our revenues are derived from the capital expenditures of companies involved in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas (“E&Ps”).  At the core, the level of capital expenditures is dictated by current and expected future prices of crude oil and natural gas, which are determined by various supply and demand factors.  Both commodities have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be, cyclical and highly volatile.

			With respect to U.S. Land Drilling, the resurgence of oil and natural gas production coming from the United States brought about by unconventional shale drilling for oil has significantly impacted the supply of oil and natural gas. The advent of unconventional drilling in the United States began in earnest in 2009 and continues to evolve as E&Ps drill longer lateral wells. During this time, we designed, built and delivered new technology AC drive rigs (FlexRigs) to the market at a fast pace, substantially growing our fleet.  The pace of progress of unconventional drilling was interrupted by a decrease in crude oil prices in late 2014 from $106 per barrel in June 2014 to below $30 per barrel in early 2016.

			Late in 2017, crude oil prices began to recover, along with the level of activity in unconventional drilling. Throughout this time, the length of the lateral section of wells drilled in the U.S. has continued to grow.  The progression of longer lateral wells has required many of the industries’ rigs to be upgraded to certain specifications in order to meet the technical challenges of drilling longer lateral wells.  The upgraded rigs meeting those specifications are commonly referred to in the industry as super-spec rigs and have the following specific characteristics: AC Drive, 1,500 horsepower drawworks, 750,000 lbs. hookload rating, 7,500 psi mud circulating system and multiple-well pad capability.

			Beginning in 2018, we saw the demand for super-spec rigs increase, as crude oil ranged between  $59 and $66 per barrel.  During 2018, the demand for super-spec rigs continued to increase and we benefitted by gaining market share as a result of having the largest super-spec fleet in the industry and having the largest number of rigs that could readily and economically be upgraded to the super-spec classification.  During fiscal year 2018, we converted two FlexRig4’s to super-spec capacity and upgraded 52 of our other rigs to super-spec, including 51 FlexRig3’s and one FlexRig5.  As of September 30, 2018, we held over 40 percent of the super-spec market share in U.S. land drilling.  Due to our financial strength, we are in the position to continue to upgrade rigs to super-spec as long as market demand for such rigs remains high and we have a supply of economically viable super-spec upgradable rigs.

			Thus far in fiscal year 2019, crude oil prices have fallen from recent highs, but are still higher than the average price when exploration and production companies set their 2018 capital budgets. Accordingly, we expect higher levels of exploration and production capital expenditures by our customers in 2019. As such, we expect the demand for super-spec rigs to remain elevated and robust well into fiscal year 2019, and we are well positioned to continue to upgrade our rigs to super-spec to meet our customers’ needs. In addition, there will be more opportunities driven by our marketing efforts for our non super-spec rigs (e.g. FlexRig4) to return to the market, targeting on customer programs that do not require super-spec capabilities and can be offered at a lower price point while still exceeding our return hurdles.  We are also seeing growing interest from customers to enter into multi-year contracts. If the market remains strong and the supply of economically viable super-spec rigs is depleted, the potential for newly built rigs in the industry may return, but we expect that much higher levels of pricing and term contract coverage will be required before the industry sees significant capital deployed for new build rigs.

			In our International Land Drilling segment, we believe that our market leading position in the Neuquén basin of Argentina may provide opportunities for us to deploy additional AC rigs from the United States.  We have seen periodic spot market work for our deeper drilling 3,000 horsepower rigs in Northern Argentina. Spot market contracts do not have a defined term and operate on a well-by-well basis. In fiscal year 2018, we reactivated four rigs in Colombia with renewed interest in the deeper drilling 3,000 horsepower rigs as well as our two FlexRig3 rigs. We expect Colombia to be a relatively stable market in fiscal year 2019 with potential upside. Overall, we have seen an increase in tendering activity from our customers in the international market resulting from higher oil prices. We believe that our international land operations are a potential area of growth over the next several years, but acknowledge that such growth may be more sporadic than what we expect in the U.S. market.

			At this time, our Offshore Drilling operations are expected to report relatively stable utilization and cash flows in the upcoming fiscal year. We anticipate one or more of our platform rigs could either be stacked or placed on a lower margin stack rate towards the end of fiscal year 2019.

 Recent Developments

 Acquisitions

			On December 8, 2017, we completed an acquisition (“MagVAR Acquisition”) of an unaffiliated company, Magnetic Variation Services, LLC (“MagVAR”), which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The operations for MagVAR are included within our other non-reportable business segments.

			Through comprehensive 3D geomagnetic reference modeling, MagVAR provides measurement while drilling (“MWD”) survey corrections by identifying and quantifying MWD tool measurement errors in real-time, greatly improving directional drilling performance and wellbore placement. Founded in 2010, MagVAR will maintain its headquarters in Colorado.

			At the effective time of the MagVAR Acquisition, MagVAR shareholders received aggregate cash consideration of $47.9 million, net of customary closing adjustments, and certain management members received restricted stock awards covering 213,904 shares of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. common stock.  At closing, $6.0 million of the cash consideration was placed in escrow, to be released to the sellers twelve months after the acquisition closing date.  Transaction costs related to the MagVAR Acquisition incurred during fiscal year 2018 were approximately $1.2 million and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expense.

			On June 2, 2017, we completed a merger transaction (“MOTIVE Merger”) pursuant to which an unaffiliated drilling technology company, MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MOTIVE”), was merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary Spring Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation.  MOTIVE survived the transaction and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

			MOTIVE has a proprietary Bit Guidance System™ that is an algorithm-driven system that considers the total economic consequences of directional drilling decisions and is designed to consistently lower drilling costs through more efficient drilling and increased hydrocarbon production through smoother wellbores and more accurate well placement.  Given our strong and longstanding technology and innovation focus, we believe the technology will continue to advance and provide further benefits for the industry.

			At the effective time of the MOTIVE Merger, MOTIVE shareholders received aggregate cash consideration of $74.3 million, net of customary closing adjustments. During fiscal year 2018, MOTIVE shareholders received additional cash consideration of $10.6 million in an earnout payment and may be eligible to receive up to an additional $12.5 million in potential earnout payments based on future performance.  Transaction costs related to the MOTIVE Merger incurred during fiscal year 2017 were $3.2 million and are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expense.

			Additional information regarding the MagVAR and MOTIVE acquisitions is described in Note 3--Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements. The operations for MagVAR and MOTIVE are included within our other non-reportable business segments.  The MagVAR and MOTIVE Mergers  were accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their acquisition date fair values.

 Impairments

			Consistent with our policy, we evaluate our drilling rigs and related equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. Our evaluation, among other things, includes a review of external market factors and an assessment on the future marketability of specific rigs’ asset group. Given the continued low utilization within our International FlexRig4 asset group and two of our domestic and international conventional rigs’ asset groups, together with the continued delivery of new, more capable rigs, we considered these economic factors to be indicators that these rigs’ asset groups may potentially be impaired.

			At September 30, 2018, we performed impairment testing on our International FlexRig4 asset group, which has an aggregate net book value of $63.0 million. We concluded that the net book value of the asset group is recoverable through estimated undiscounted future cash flows with a surplus of approximately 23 percent. The most significant assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flow model include: timing on awards of future drilling contracts, oil prices, operating dayrates, operating costs, rig reactivation costs, drilling rig utilization, revenue efficiency, estimated remaining economic useful life and net proceeds received upon future sale/disposition. The assumptions are consistent with the Company’s internal budgets and forecasts for future years. These significant assumptions are classified as Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures as they are based upon unobservable inputs and primarily rely on management assumptions and forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions used in our analysis are reasonable and appropriate and the asset group weighted average of expected future undiscounted net cash flows exceeds the net book value of the asset group as of the fiscal year 2018 year-end impairment evaluation, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the analysis and our resulting conclusion.

			At September 30, 2018, we engaged a third party independent accounting firm who performed a market valuation, utilizing the market approach, on two of our domestic and international conventional rigs’ asset groups, which have aggregate net book values of $9.0 million and $15.2 million, respectively. We concluded that the fair values of these two asset groups exceed the net book values by approximately 64 percent and 141 percent, respectively, and as such, no impairment was recorded. The significant assumptions in the valuation exercise are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.

			During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, after ceasing operations in Ecuador, within our International Land segment, we entered into a sales negotiation with respect to the six conventional rigs, within a separated international conventional rigs’ asset group, with net book values of $20.8 million, present in the country, pursuant to which the rigs, together with associated equipment and machinery would be sold to a third party to be recycled.  Certain components of these rigs with an $8.5 million net book value, that are not subject to the sale agreement, will be transferred to the United States to be utilized on other FlexRigs with high activity and demand. The sales transaction was completed in November 2018. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $9.2 million ($7.0 million, net of tax, or $0.06 per diluted share), which is included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. As a result, the remaining rig within the same asset group, not to be disposed of, was written down resulting in an additional impairment charge of $1.4 million ($1.0 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share).

			Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, within our U.S. Land segment, management committed to a plan to auction several previously decommissioned rigs during fiscal year 2019. As a result, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $5.7 million ($4.2 million, net of tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), which is included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

			During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, and as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we performed a detailed assessment of the TerraVici technology reporting unit, where $4.7 million goodwill was allocated. We determined that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and recorded goodwill impairment losses of $4.7 million ($3.5 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share). In addition, we recorded an intangible asset impairment loss of $0.9 million ($0.7 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). These impairment losses are included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Our goodwill impairment analysis performed on our remaining technology reporting units in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 did not result in impairment charges.

			Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017

 Consolidated Results of Operations

 All per share amounts included in the Results of Operations discussion are stated on a diluted basis. Except as specifically discussed, the following results of operations pertain only to our continuing operations.

			Net Income (Loss) Our net income for fiscal year 2018 was $482.7 million ($4.39 earnings per share), compared with net loss of $128.2 million ($1.20 loss per share) for fiscal year 2017. Net income in fiscal year 2018 and net loss in fiscal year 2017 include after-tax income from early termination revenue associated with drilling contracts terminated prior to the expiration of their fixed term of $12.6 million ($0.12 per share) and $20.2 million ($0.18 per share), respectively. Net income in fiscal year 2018 and net loss in fiscal year 2017 include after‑tax gains from the sale of assets of $16.7 million ($0.15 per diluted share) and $14.3 million ($0.13 per diluted share), respectively. Additionally, net income in fiscal year 2018 and net loss in fiscal year 2017 includes after-tax income from a tax benefit of $477.2 million ($4.36 per diluted share) and a tax benefit of $56.7 million ($0.52 per diluted share), respectively.

			Revenue Consolidated operating revenues were $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2017, including early termination revenue of $17.1 million and $29.4 million in each respective fiscal year.  Excluding early termination revenue, operating revenue increased $694.8 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017.  Oil prices steeply declined from over $106 per barrel in June 2014 to below $30 per barrel in early 2016.  During the second half of calendar year 2016, oil prices increased and fluctuated within a $42 to $54 per barrel price range for most of fiscal year 2017. However, during the second half of fiscal year 2018, oil prices were mostly in the $62 to $77 per barrel price range. Primarily as a result of the impact of oil prices on drilling activity by exploration and production companies during that time frame, the number of revenue days in our U.S. Land segment totaled 77,980 in fiscal year 2018, compared to 57,120 in fiscal year 2017.

			Asset Impairment Management monitors industry market conditions impacting its long‑lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill. When required, an impairment analysis is performed to determine if any impairment exists.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, and after ceasing operations in Ecuador, we entered into a sales negotiation with respect to the six conventional rigs present in the country, pursuant to which the rigs, together with associated equipment and machinery, would be sold to a third party to be recycled. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $9.2 million. The remaining rig within the same asset group, not to be disposed of, was written down resulting in an additional impairment charge of $1.4 million ($1.0 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, management committed to a plan to auction several previously decommissioned rigs during fiscal year 2019. As a result, we wrote them down to their estimated fair values and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $5.7 million. Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets impairment losses of $5.6 million related to the TerraVici technology reporting unit. The fiscal year 2018 asset impairment charges are included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. We did not record any impairment in fiscal year 2017.

			Interest and Dividend Income Interest and dividend income was $8.0 million and $5.9 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The higher income in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to higher earnings on available cash equivalents and short-term investments.

			Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 were $1.7 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2017.  The increase in fiscal year 2018 from fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to a higher level of activity in fiscal year 2018.

 Table of Contents

			General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses totaled $200.6 million in fiscal year 2018 and $151.0 million in fiscal year 2017.  During fiscal year 2018, we incurred transaction costs of $1.2 million related to our acquisition of MagVAR. Additionally, increased employee general and administrative headcount, primarily as a result of the acquisition of MagVAR and MOTIVE, caused an increase in employee compensation costs, including taxes, benefits and stock-based compensation, compared to fiscal year 2017.

			Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $583.8 million in fiscal year 2018 and $585.5 million in fiscal year 2017. Depreciation and amortization includes amortization of intangible assets of $5.4 million and $1.1 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, and abandonments of equipment of $27.7 million and $42.6 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal year 2018, depreciation expense also includes $9.7 million of accelerated depreciation for components on rigs that are planned for conversion in fiscal year 2019. Depreciation expense, exclusive of abandonments and accelerated depreciation,  increased one percent in fiscal year 2018 from fiscal year 2017. As the drilling markets continued to recover during fiscal year 2017, we began abandoning older rig components that were replaced by upgrades to our rig fleet to meet customer demands for additional capabilities.  This trend continued in fiscal year 2018.

			Interest Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, totaled $24.3 million in fiscal year 2018 and $19.7 million in fiscal year 2017. Interest expense is primarily attributable to fixed‑rate debt outstanding. Capitalized interest was $0.4 million and $0.3 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. All of the capitalized interest is attributable to our rig upgrade and rig construction programs.

			Income Taxes We had an income tax benefit of $477.2 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $56.7 million in fiscal year 2017. The effective income tax rate was (3,012.3) percent in fiscal year 2018 compared to 30.7 percent in fiscal year 2017. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was impacted by income tax adjustments related to the reduction of the federal statutory corporate income tax rate as part of the Tax Reform Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, and an increase in the deferred state income tax rate. In addition, effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate (24.5 percent for fiscal year 2018 and 35.0 percent for fiscal year 2017) due to non-deductible permanent items and state and foreign income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Recoverability of any tax assets are evaluated and necessary allowances are provided. The carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on management’s judgments using certain estimates and assumptions that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the benefits of such assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, additional valuation allowances may be recorded against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the future. See Note 8—Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional income tax disclosures.

			Research and Development During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we incurred $18.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. The increase in expense is primarily related to the acquisitions of MOTIVE and MagVAR given that a portion of their ongoing expenses are classified as research and development. We anticipate research and development expenses to continue during fiscal year 2019.

			Discontinued Operations Expenses incurred within the country of Venezuela are reported as discontinued operations. In March 2016, the Venezuelan government implemented the previously announced plans for a new foreign currency exchange system. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A., filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery. Activity within discontinued operations for both fiscal years 2017 and 2018 is primarily a result of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on remaining in country assets and liabilities.

 (1) Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $242,617 and $148,218 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.

			Operating Income (Loss) In fiscal year 2018, the U.S. Land segment had operating income of $150.7 million compared to an operating loss of $94.9 million in fiscal year 2017. Included in U.S. land revenues for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is approximately $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, from early termination of fixed‑term contracts.  Fixed‑term contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term (except in limited circumstances including sustained unacceptable performance by us).

			Revenue Excluding early termination revenue of $219 and $428 per day for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, average revenue per day for fiscal year 2018 increased by $1,013 to $23,192 from $22,179 in fiscal year 2017.  Our activity increased year-over-year in response to higher commodity prices resulting in a 36.5 percent increase in revenue days when comparing fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2017.

			Direct Operating Expenses Direct rig expense increased to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2018 from $984.2 million in fiscal year 2017.  This increase was primarily attributable to increased activity. Additionally, we implemented a wage increase for our field personnel in some regions in April 2018.

			General and Administrative Expense In fiscal year 2018, general and administrative expense increased 14.7 percent compared to 2017. This change was primarily driven by an increase in employee headcount, which resulted in an increase in employee compensation, including taxes, benefits and stock-based compensation.

			Asset Impairment Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, management committed to a plan to auction several previously decommissioned rigs during fiscal year 2019. As a result, we wrote these rigs down to their estimated fair values and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $5.7 million, which is included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

			Depreciation Depreciation includes charges for abandoned equipment of $26.3 million and $42.2 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal year 2018, depreciation expense also includes $9.7 million of accelerated depreciation for components on rigs that are scheduled for conversion in fiscal year 2019. As the drilling markets continued to recover during fiscal year 2017, we began abandoning older rig components to meet customer demands for additional capabilities. This trend continued in fiscal year 2018. Excluding the abandonments and accelerated depreciation, depreciation in fiscal year 2018 increased from fiscal year 2017.

			Utilization Rig utilization increased to 61 percent in fiscal year 2018 from 45 percent in fiscal year 2017. The total number of available rigs at both September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was 350.

			At September 30, 2018, 232 out of 350 existing rigs in the U.S. Land segment were generating revenue. Of the 232 rigs generating revenue, 136 were under fixed‑term contracts, and 96 were working well-to-well. At November 9, 2018, the number of existing rigs under fixed‑term contracts in the segment was 141 and the number of rigs working in the spot market was 95.

 (1) Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $20,279 and $21,578 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The operating statistics only include rigs owned by us and exclude offshore platform management and labor service contracts and currency revaluation expense.

			Operating Income In fiscal year 2018, the Offshore segment had operating income of $26.1 million compared to operating income of $24.2 million in fiscal year 2017.

			Revenue Average rig revenue per day increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to several rigs moving to higher pricing from previous standby or other special dayrates. During April 2018, a previously idle rig commenced work on a customer’s platform.

			Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense increased to $26,009 per day in fiscal year 2018 from $23,172 per day in fiscal year 2017.  This increase was primarily attributable to rig start-up expenses and unfavorable adjustments to self-insurance expenses related to workers’ compensation.

			Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased 11.7 percent in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This change was primarily driven by two rigs becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year 2018.

			Utilization During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we sold one of our offshore rigs.  At September 30, 2018, six of our eight platform rigs were contracted compared to five of the eight available platform rigs at September 30, 2017.

			Operating Loss The International Land segment had an operating loss of $0.7 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to an operating loss of $7.2 million for fiscal year 2017.

			Revenue Our activity has increased primarily in response to higher commodity prices.  We experienced a 35.2 percent increase in revenue days when comparing fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2017. The average number of active rigs was 18.2 during fiscal year 2018 compared to 13.6 during fiscal year 2017.

			Direct Operating Expenses Although direct operating expenses increased in fiscal year 2018 to $177.9 million from $163.5 million in fiscal year 2017, the average rig expense per day decreased by $5,550, an 18.7 percent decrease as compared to the fiscal year 2017 average rig expense. Included in direct operating expenses are foreign currency transaction losses of $4.0 million and $6.0 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The losses are primarily due to an ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso beginning in December 2015.

			Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased 12.7 percent in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was due to several rig components in Argentina that became fully depreciated during fiscal year 2018.

			Asset Impairment Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, after ceasing operations in Ecuador, we entered into a sales negotiation with respect to six conventional rigs, with net book values of $20.8 million, present in the country, pursuant to which the rigs, together with associated equipment and machinery, would be sold to a third party to be recycled. Certain components of these rigs with an $8.5 million net book value, that are not subject to the sale agreement, will be transferred to the United States to be utilized on other FlexRigs with high activity and demand. The sales transaction was completed in November 2018. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $9.2 million ($7.0 million, net of tax, or $0.06 per diluted share), which is included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 related to these rigs. As a result, the remaining rig within the same asset group, not to be disposed of, was written down resulting in an additional impairment charge of $1.4 million ($1.0 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share).

			Utilization Utilization increased from 36 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 49 percent in fiscal year 2018. The increase was driven by the increase in rig activity as discussed above.

 Other Operations

			Results of our other operations, excluding corporate selling, general and administrative costs and corporate depreciation, are as follows:

			Operating Loss Other operations in fiscal year 2018 had an operating loss of $35.9 million compared to an operating loss of $9.4 million in fiscal year 2017. The change was primarily driven by the acquisition of MagVAR in December 2017 and twelve full months of operations of MOTIVE, which was acquired in June 2017. Refer to Note 3—Business Combinations of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.

			Asset Impairment Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets impairment losses of $5.6 million related to the TerraVici technology reporting unit where $4.7 million goodwill was allocated. This impairment loss is included in Asset Impairment Charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

			Results of Operation for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

 Consolidated Results of Operations

 All per share amounts included in the Results of Operations discussion are stated on a diluted basis. Except as specifically discussed, the following results of operations pertain only to our continuing operations.

			Net Loss Our net loss for fiscal year 2017 was $128.2 million ($1.20 loss per share) compared to a net loss of $56.8 million ($0.54 loss per share) for fiscal year 2016. Net loss in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 includes after-tax income from early termination revenue associated with drilling contracts terminated prior to the expiration of their fixed term of $20.2 million ($0.18 per share) and $139.3 million ($1.29 per share), respectively. Net loss in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 includes after‑tax gains from the sale of assets of $14.3 million ($0.13 per share) and $6.1 million ($0.06 per share), respectively. Included in our fiscal year 2016 net loss is an after‑tax loss of $15.9 million ($0.15 loss per share) from an other‑than‑temporary impairment of our marketable equity security position in Atwood Oceanics, Inc. (“Atwood”). Net loss in fiscal year 2016 also includes an after‑tax loss of $12.0 million ($0.11 loss per share) from the settlement of litigation and a $3.8 million loss ($0.04 loss per share) from discontinued operations.

			Revenue Consolidated operating revenues were $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2017 and $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2016, including early termination revenue of $29.4 million and $219.0 million in each respective fiscal year. Primarily as a result of the impact of oil prices on drilling activity by exploration and production companies during that time frame, the number of revenue days in our U.S. Land segment totaled 57,120 in fiscal year 2017 and 36,984 in fiscal year 2016.

			Interest and Dividend Income Interest and dividend income was $5.9 million and $3.2 million in fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The higher income in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to higher earnings on available cash equivalents and short-term investments.

			Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating costs in fiscal year 2017 were $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion in fiscal year 2016. The increase in fiscal year 2017 from fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to an increase in drilling activity.

			General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses totaled $151.0 million in fiscal year 2017 and $146.2 million in fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, we incurred transaction costs of $3.2 million related to our acquisition of MOTIVE. In addition, bonuses paid to employees increased in fiscal year 2017.

			Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $585.5 million in fiscal year 2017 and $598.6 million in fiscal year 2016. Depreciation and amortization includes abandonments of equipment of $42.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and $39.3 million in fiscal year 2016. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges on rig and rig related equipment of $6.3 million in fiscal year 2016. Depreciation expense, exclusive of abandonments, decreased three percent in fiscal year 2017 from fiscal year 2016.  The decrease is primarily due to relatively lower levels of capital expenditures during fiscal year 2017 and legacy assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives.  Abandonments were primarily due to the abandonment of used drilling equipment in both fiscal years.

			Interest Interest expense net of amounts capitalized totaled $19.7 million in fiscal year 2017 and $22.9 million in fiscal year 2016. Interest expense is primarily attributable to fixed‑rate debt outstanding. There was a favorable adjustment to interest expense of $5.2 million in fiscal year 2017 related to the reversal of previously booked uncertain tax positions where the statute of limitations had expired. Capitalized interest was $0.3 million and $2.8 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. All of the capitalized interest is attributable to our rig construction and upgrade program.

			Income Taxes We had an income tax benefit of $56.7 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $19.7 million in fiscal year 2016. The effective income tax rate was 30.7 percent in fiscal year 2017 and 27.1 percent in fiscal year 2016. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Recoverability of any tax assets are evaluated and necessary allowances are provided. The carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on management’s judgments using certain estimates and assumptions that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the benefits of such assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, additional valuation allowances may be recorded against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the future. See Note 8—Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional income tax disclosures.

 (1) Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $148,218 and $82,337 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.

			Operating Income (Loss) In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. Land segment had an operating loss of $94.9 million compared to operating income of $74.1 million in fiscal year 2016.  Included in U.S. land revenues for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 is approximately $24.5 million and $219.0 million, respectively, from early termination of fixed-term contracts.

			Revenue Excluding early termination revenue of $428 and $5,921 per day for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, average revenue per day for fiscal year 2017 decreased by $3,269 to $22,179 from $25,448 in fiscal year 2016. Our activity increased year-over-year in response to higher commodity prices, resulting in a 54 percent increase in revenue days when comparing fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016. However, legacy term contracts at high dayrates made up a lower proportion of our fiscal year 2017 activity due to continued contract expirations. Further, newly contracted rigs which made up a majority of our fiscal year 2017 activity were priced at relatively lower levels which reflected depressed market conditions.

			Direct Operating Expenses The average rig expense per day increased to $14,623 in fiscal year 2017 from $14,117 in fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to start-up expenses related to rigs returning to work during fiscal year 2017.

			Depreciation Depreciation includes charges for abandoned equipment of $42.2 million and $38.8 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Included in abandonments in fiscal year 2017 are older rig components that were replaced by upgrades to our rig fleet to meet customer demands for additional capabilities. Included in abandonments in fiscal year 2016 is the retirement of used drilling equipment. Excluding the abandonments, depreciation in fiscal year 2017 decreased from fiscal year 2016, primarily due to relatively low levels of capital expenditures during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 and certain legacy assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives in fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016.

			Asset Impairment Charge During fiscal year 2016, we recorded an asset impairment charge in the U.S. Land segment of $6.3 million to reduce the carrying value of rig and rig related equipment classified as held for sale to their estimated fair values, based on expected sales prices.

			Utilization Rig utilization increased to 45 percent in fiscal year 2017 from 30 percent in fiscal year 2016.  The total number of rigs at September 30, 2017 was 350 compared to 348 rigs at September 30, 2016.  The net increase is due to two new FlexRigs completed in fiscal year 2017 and included in our operating statistics.

			At September 30, 2017, 197 out of 350 existing rigs in the U.S. Land segment were generating revenue.  Of the 197 rigs generating revenue, 100 were under fixed-term contracts, and 97 were working in the spot market.

The operating statistics only include rigs owned by us and exclude offshore platform management and labor service contracts and currency revaluation expense.

			Operating Income In fiscal year 2017, the Offshore segment had operating income of $24.2 million compared to operating income of $15.7 million in fiscal year 2016.

			Revenue Average rig revenue per day and average rig margin per day increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to receiving full pricing during fiscal year 2017 after receiving lower pricing while on standby or other special dayrates during fiscal year 2016.

			Depreciation Depreciation decreased slightly by 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to the sale of a rig during fiscal year 2017 and some assets becoming fully depreciated during the year.

			Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expense in fiscal year 2017 decreased by 9.7 percent compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to two less rigs working during the year.

comparing fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016. The average number of active rigs was 13.6 during fiscal year 2017 compared to 14.7 during fiscal year 2016.

			Direct Operating Expenses Although direct operating expenses decreased in fiscal year 2017 to $163.5 million from $184.0 million in fiscal year 2016, the average rig expense per day increased $1,123 or 4 percent as compared to the fiscal year 2016 average rig expense. Included in direct operating expenses are foreign currency transaction losses of $6.0 million and $9.8 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fiscal year 2016 losses were primarily due to a devaluation of the Argentine peso in December 2015.

			Depreciation Depreciation decreased slightly by 6.1 percent in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to some assets becoming fully depreciated during the year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Sources of Liquidity

			Our sources of available liquidity include existing cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, and availability under our credit facility. Our liquidity requirements include meeting ongoing working capital needs, funding our capital expenditure projects, paying dividends declared, and repaying our outstanding indebtedness. Historically, we have financed operations primarily through internally generated cash flows. During periods when internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to meet liquidity needs, we will borrow from available credit sources, access capital markets or sell our portfolio securities.  Likewise, if we are generating excess cash flows, we may invest in highly rated short‑term money market and debt securities. These investments can include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency issued debt securities, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We have continued to reinvest maturities and earnings during fiscal years 2018 and 2017. The securities are recorded at fair value.

			We may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as necessary, fund our additional purchases, exchange or redeem Senior Notes, or repay any amounts under our credit facility. Our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, market and industry conditions and market perceptions of our industry, general economic conditions, our revenue backlog and our capital expenditure commitments.

 Cash Flows

			Our cash flows fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, among others, the number of our drilling rigs under contract, the dayrates we receive under those contracts, the efficiency with which we operate our drilling units, the timing of collections on outstanding accounts receivable, the timing of payments to our vendors for operating costs, and capital expenditures. To date, general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating margins.

			As of September 30, 2018, we had $284.4 million of cash on hand and $41.5 million of short-term investments. Our cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:

Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (237,020) $ (384,186) $ 176,177

 Operating Activities

			Net working capital excluding cash and short-term investments increased $87.6 million to $412.6 million as of September 30, 2018 from $325.0 million as of September 30, 2017 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of materials and supplies, offset by an increase in accrued liabilities. Net cash provided from operating activities was $544.5 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $361.6 million in fiscal year 2017. The $182.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in net income due to increased activity during the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2016, net cash provided from operating activities was $754.5 million. The $392.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a larger net loss reported in fiscal year 2017.

 Investing Activities

			Capital Expenditures Our investing activities are primarily related to capital expenditures for our fleet. Our capital expenditures were $466.6 million in 2018, $397.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and $257.2 million in fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year 2019 capital spending is currently estimated to be between $650 million and $680  million. This estimate includes normal capital maintenance requirements, capital spending related to reactivating idle rigs, tubulars and other upgrades primarily related to improving our existing rig fleet.

			Acquisition of Business During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we paid $47.9 million and $70.4 million, respectively, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of drilling technology companies.

			Sale of Assets Our proceeds from asset sales totaled $44.4 million in fiscal year 2018, $23.4 million in fiscal year 2017 and $21.8 million in fiscal year 2016. Income from asset sales in fiscal year 2018 totaled $22.7 million, $20.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and $9.9 million in fiscal year 2016. In each year we had sales of old or damaged rig equipment and drill pipe used in the ordinary course of business included in operating activity within the statement of cash flow.

			Stock Portfolio Held We manage a portfolio of marketable securities consisting of common shares of Ensco plc (“Ensco”) and Schlumberger, Ltd. that, at the close of fiscal year 2018, had a fair value of $82.5 million. The value of the portfolio is subject to fluctuation in the market and may vary considerably over time. The portfolio is recorded at fair value on our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we determined that the decline in fair value below our cost basis in Atwood Oceanics, Inc. (“Atwood”) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non‑cash charge totaling $26.0 million.

			In May 2017, Ensco announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ensco would acquire Atwood in an all-stock transaction. The transaction closed on October 6, 2017.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, we received 1.60 shares of Ensco for each share of our Atwood common stock. The securities in our portfolio are subject to a wide variety of market‑related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of the holdings. In general, the portfolio is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in unrealized after‑tax value reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet.

 Our stock portfolio held as of September 30, 2018 is presented below:

------------------ ------------------------------------ ---------- ------ ------------ - ------
 Number
September 30, 2018 of Shares Cost Basis Market Value
 (in thousands, except share amounts)
Ensco plc 6,400,000 $ 34,760 $ 54,016
Schlumberger, Ltd. 467,500 3,713 28,480
Total $ 38,473 $ 82,496

 Financing Activities

			The increase of $8.4 million in net cash used by financing activities in fiscal year 2018 from fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation that occurred in 2017 and not in 2018. The decrease of $43.3 million in net cash used by financing activities between fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to $40.0 million in cash used to payback long-term debt in fiscal year 2016.

			Dividends We paid dividends of $2.82, $2.80, and $2.78 per share during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total dividends were $308.4 million, $305.5 million, and $300.2 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adjusting for stock splits accordingly, we have increased the effective annual dividend per share every fiscal year for the past 46 years. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

 Credit Facilities

			On July 13, 2016, we entered into a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2016 Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of July 13, 2021. The 2016 Credit Facility had a maximum of $75 million available to use as letters of credit. The majority of any borrowings under the facility would accrue interest at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We also paid a commitment fee based on the unused balance of the facility. Borrowing spreads as well as commitment fees were determined according to a scale based on the Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio. The spread over LIBOR ranged from 1.125 percent to 1.75 percent per annum and commitment fees ranged from 0.15 percent to 0.30 percent per annum. Based on our debt to total capitalization on September 30, 2018, the spread over LIBOR and commitment fees would be 1.125 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively. There was a financial covenant in the facility that required us to maintain a total debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 50 percent. The 2016 Credit Facility contained additional terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants that we believe were usual and customary in

unsecured debt arrangements for companies of similar size and credit quality, including a limitation that priority debt (as defined in the agreement) could not exceed 17.5 percent of the net worth of the Company.  As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings, but there were three letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $39.3 million.  At September 30, 2018, we had $260.7 million available to borrow under the 2016 Credit Facility.  Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company decreased one of the three letters of credit by $1.3 million, which increased availability under the facility to $262.0 million.

			Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, on November 13, 2018, we entered into a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Credit Facility”). In connection with entering into the 2018 Credit Facility, we terminated the 2016 Credit Facility. See Note 19-–Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the 2018 Credit Facility.

			The Company has a $12 million unsecured standalone line of credit facility, which is purposed for the issuance of bid and performance bonds, as needed, for international land operations.  The Company currently has no outstanding obligations against this facility.

			The applicable agreements for all unsecured debt contain additional terms, conditions and restrictions that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies that are similar in size and credit quality. At September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance for the next fiscal year.

 Repurchase and Retirement of Common Shares

			We did not have any active stock repurchase program in fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. We have an evergreen authorization to purchase up to four million shares per fiscal year.

 Future Cash Requirements

			Our operating cash requirements, scheduled debt repayments, interest payments, any declared dividends, and estimated capital expenditures, including our rig upgrade construction program, for fiscal year 2019 are expected to be funded through current cash and cash to be provided from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels.

			The long‑term debt to total capitalization ratio was 10.1 percent at September 30, 2018 compared to 10.6 percent at September 30, 2017.

 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

			We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. For information regarding our drilling contract backlog, see Item 1— “Business — Contract Backlog”.

			The above table does not include obligations for our pension plan or amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we did not make any contributions to the pension plan. Contributions may be made in fiscal year 2019 to fund unexpected distributions in lieu of liquidating pension assets. Future contributions beyond fiscal year 2019 are difficult to estimate due to multiple variables involved.

			At September 30, 2018, we had $17.1 million recorded for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties. However, the timing of such payments to the respective taxing authorities cannot be estimated at this time. Income taxes are more fully described in Note 8—Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

			Accounting policies that we consider significant are summarized in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Risks and Uncertainties to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on‑going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates used in our financial statements.

 Property, Plant and Equipment

			Property, plant and equipment, including renewals and betterments, are capitalized at cost, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The interest expense applicable to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as a component of the cost of such assets. We account for the depreciation of property, plant and equipment using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets considering the estimated salvage value of the property, plant and equipment. Both the estimated useful lives and salvage values require the use of management estimates. Certain events, such as unforeseen changes in operations, technology or market conditions, could materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation or result in abandonments. For the fiscal years presented in this report, no significant changes were made to the determinations of useful lives or salvage values. Upon retirement or other disposal of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains or losses are recorded in the results of operations.

 Impairment of Long‑lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

			Management assesses the potential impairment of our long‑lived assets and finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Changes that could prompt such an assessment may include equipment obsolescence, changes in the market demand, periods of relatively low rig utilization, declining revenue per day, declining cash margin per day, completion of specific contracts and/or overall changes in general market conditions. If a review of the long‑lived assets and finite-lived intangibles indicates that the carrying value of certain of these assets is more than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge

is made, as required, to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Cash flows are estimated by management considering factors such as prospective market demand, recent changes in rig technology and its effect on each rig’s marketability, any cash investment required to make a rig marketable, suitability of rig size and makeup to existing platforms, and competitive dynamics including utilization. The fair value of drilling rigs is determined based upon either an income approach using estimated discounted future cash flows or market approach, considering factors such as recent market sales of rigs of other companies and our own sales of rigs, appraisals and other factors. The use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of assets and could therefore affect any impairment measurement.

			We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may exceed their fair value. For impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level.  We initially assess goodwill for impairment based on qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying amount.

			If further testing is necessary or a quantitative test is elected, we quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  Impairment for indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value.

			At September 30, 2018, we performed impairment testing on our International FlexRig4 asset group, which has an aggregate net book value of $63.0 million. We concluded that the net book value of the drilling rig’s asset group is recoverable through estimated undiscounted future cash flows with a surplus of approximately 23 percent. The most significant assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flow model include: timing on awards of future drilling contracts, oil prices, operating dayrates, operating costs, rig-  reactivation costs, drilling rig utilization, revenue efficiency, estimated remaining economic useful life and net proceeds received upon future sale/disposition. The assumptions are consistent with the Company’s internal budgets and forecasts for future years. These significant assumptions are classified as Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures as they are based upon unobservable inputs and primarily rely on management assumptions and forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions used in our analysis are reasonable and appropriate and the asset group weighted average of expected future undiscounted net cash flows exceeds the net book value of the asset group as of the fiscal year 2018 year-end impairment evaluation, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the analysis and our resulting conclusion.

			At September 30, 2018, we engaged a third party independent accounting firm who performed a market valuation, utilizing the market approach, on two of our domestic and international conventional rigs’ asset groups, which have an aggregate net book values of $9.0 million and $15.2 million, respectively. We concluded that the fair values of these two asset groups exceed the net book values by approximately 64 percent and 141 percent, respectively and as such, no impairment was recorded. The significant assumptions in the valuation exercise are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.

			During fiscal years 2018 and 2016, we recognized $23.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively of asset impairment charges.

 Self‑Insurance Accruals

			We self‑insure a significant portion of expected losses relating to workers’ compensation, general liability, employer’s liability and automobile liability. Generally, deductibles range from $1 million to $5 million per occurrence depending on the coverage and whether a claim occurs outside or inside of the United States. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events but there can be no assurance that such coverage will respond or be adequate in all circumstances. Estimates are recorded for incurred outstanding liabilities for workers’ compensation and other casualty claims. Retained losses are estimated and accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred. Estimates for liabilities and retained losses are based on adjusters’ estimates, our historical loss experience and statistical methods that we believe are reliable. We also engage an actuary to perform a periodic review of our domestic casualty losses. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs.

 Our wholly‑owned captive insurance company finances a significant portion of the physical damage risk on company‑owned drilling rigs as well as international casualty deductibles. An actuary reviews our captive losses on an annual basis.

			We insure land rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement costs on the inception date of the policies. However, we self-insure large deductibles under these policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to offshore platform rigs and “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico. We self‑insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and most cyber risks.

 Revenue Recognition

			Contract drilling revenues are comprised of daywork drilling contracts for which the related revenues and expenses are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured. For certain contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment. Mobilization payments received, and direct costs incurred for the mobilization, are deferred and recognized over the term of the related drilling contract. Costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Reimbursements received for out‑of‑pocket expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct costs. For contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met.

 Pension Costs and Obligations

			Our pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions. We make assumptions relating to discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Our discount rate is determined by matching projected cash distributions with the appropriate corporate bond yields in a yield curve analysis. The discount rate was increased to 4.27 percent from 3.79 percent as of September 30, 2018 to reflect changes in the market conditions for high‑quality fixed‑income investments. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and future expectations of rates of return. Actual results that differ from estimated assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and could therefore affect the expense recognized and obligations in future periods. As of September 30, 2006, the Pension Plan was frozen and benefit accruals were discontinued. As a result, the rate of compensation increase assumption has been eliminated from future periods. We anticipate pension expense to decrease by approximately $1.4 million in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018.

 Stock‑Based Compensation

			Historically, we have granted stock‑based awards to key employees and non‑employee directors as part of their compensation. We estimate the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of grant by applying the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions, some of which are judgmental and highly sensitive. These assumptions include, among others, the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of the stock options and the risk‑free interest rate. Expected volatilities were estimated using the historical volatility of our stock based upon the expected term of the option. The expected term of the option was derived from historical data and represents the period of time that options are estimated to be outstanding. The risk‑free interest rate for periods within the estimated life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury Strip rate in effect at the time of the grant. The fair value of each award is amortized on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period for awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.

 The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We amortize the fair value of restricted stock awards to compensation expense on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed.
