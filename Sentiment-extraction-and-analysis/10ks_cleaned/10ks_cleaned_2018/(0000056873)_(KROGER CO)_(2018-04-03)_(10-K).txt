ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

			The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of The Kroger Co. should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-looking Statements” section set forth in Part I, the “Risk Factors” section set forth in Item 1A of Part I and the “Outlook” section below.

 OUR BUSINESS

			The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902.  As of February 3, 2018, Kroger is one of the world’s largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,782 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia.  Of these stores, 2,268 have pharmacies and 1,489 have fuel centers.  We offer ClickList™ and Harris Teeter ExpressLane — personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 1,056 of our supermarkets and continue to increase our home delivery service available to customers.  In addition, we operate 782 convenience stores, either directly or through franchisees, 274 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer.

			We operate 37 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 33% of Our Brands units and 44% of the grocery category Our Brands units sold in our supermarkets; the remaining Our Brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.

			Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms.  We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers.  Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses.  Our retail operations, which represent over 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.

			On September 2, 2016, we closed our merger with Modern HC Holdings, Inc. (“ModernHEALTH”) by purchasing 100% of the outstanding shares of ModernHEALTH for $407 million.  ModernHEALTH is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2016 and 2017 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations from September 2, 2016 through January 28, 2017 and all periods in 2017.

			On December 18, 2015, we closed our merger with Roundy’s, Inc. (“Roundy’s”) by purchasing 100% of Roundy’s® outstanding common stock for $3.60 per share and assuming Roundy’s outstanding debt, for a purchase price of $866 million.  Roundy’s is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2015, 2016 and 2017, and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the last six weeks of 2015 and all periods in 2016 and 2017.

 See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy’s.

 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

			The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We provide non-GAAP measures, including First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) gross margin, FIFO operating profit, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share and free cash flow because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin, operating profit, net earnings, net earnings per diluted share and net cash provided or used by operating or investing activities or any other GAAP measure of performance.  These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.  Our calculation and reasons these are useful metrics to investors and analysts are explained below.

			We calculate FIFO gross margin as FIFO gross profit divided by sales.  FIFO gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses, but excluding the Last-In, First-Out (“LIFO”) credit or charge.  Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses.  FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness.  Management believes FIFO gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day merchandising and operational effectiveness.

 13

			We calculate FIFO operating profit as operating profit excluding the LIFO credit or charge.  FIFO operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness.  Management believes FIFO operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day operational effectiveness.

			The adjusted net earnings per diluted share metric is an important measure used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods.  We believe adjusted net earnings per diluted share is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it presents more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations.  Net earnings for 2017 include the following, which we define as the “2017 Adjusted Items”:

 · Charges to operating, general and administrative expenses (“OG&A”) of $550 million, $360 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawing from and settlements of withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds; $184 million, $117 million net of tax, related to the voluntary retirement offering (“VRO”); $110 million, $74 million net of tax, related to the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy goodwill impairment; and $502 million, $335 million net of tax, related to a company-sponsored pension plan termination (the “2017 OG&A Adjusted Items”).

 · A reduction to depreciation and amortization expenses of $19 million, $13 million net of tax, related to held for sale assets (the “2017 Depreciation Adjusted Item”).

 · A reduction to income tax expense of $922 million primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and the reduction of the statutory rate for the last five weeks of the fiscal year from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") (the “2017 Tax Expense Adjusted Item”).

			In addition, net earnings include $119 million, $79 million net of tax, due to a 53rd week in fiscal year 2017 (the “Extra Week”).

			 Net earnings for 2016 include $111 million, $71 million net of tax, of charges to OG&A related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits (the “2016 Adjusted Items”).  There were no adjusted items in 2015.

			We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus net cash used by investing activities.  Free cash flow is an important measure used by management to evaluate available funding for share repurchases, dividends, other strategic investments and managing debt levels.  Management believes free cash flow is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it demonstrates our ability to make share repurchases and other strategic investments, pay dividends and manage debt levels.

 OVERVIEW

 Notable items for 2017 are:

 · Net earnings per diluted share of $2.09.

 · Adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $2.04.

 · The Extra Week in 2017 contributed $0.09 to our net earnings per diluted share result for 2017.

 · Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.7% in 2017.

 · Digital revenue up 90% in 2017, driven by ClickList. Digital revenue primarily includes revenue from all curbside pickup locations and online sales by Vitacost.com.

 · On February 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of our convenience store business unit to EG Group for $2.15 billion.

 · Gross margin for 2017 decreased, as a percentage of sales, as compared to 2016. See Gross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin section for additional details.

 · OG&A expenses for 2017 increased, as a percentage of sales, as compared to 2016. See Operating, General and Administrative Expenses section for additional details on these fluctuations.

 · During 2017, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments.

 · We contributed $1.2 billion to company-sponsored and company-managed pension plans, which significantly addressed the underfunded position of these plans, and paid $467 million to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund. These contributions were deductible for tax purposes, resulting in a tax benefit of approximately $613 million. Included in the contribution is an incremental $111 million to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (“UFCW”) Consolidated Pension Plan (the “2017 UFCW Contribution”), which was contributed in the third quarter of 2017.

 · Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion in 2017 compared to $4.3 billion in 2016. Net cash used by investing activities was $2.7 billion in 2017 compared to $3.9 billion in 2016.

 · Free cash flow was $706 million in 2017 compared to $397 million during 2016.

 · Announced Restock Kroger during 2017. Restock Kroger has four main drivers: Redefine the Food and Grocery Customer Experience, Expand Partnerships to Create Customer Value, Develop Talent, and Live Kroger’s Purpose. Over the next three years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business.

 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, excluding fuel; jewelry stores; food production plants to outside customers; data analytic services; variable interest entities; Kroger Specialty Pharmacy; in-store health clinics; digital coupon services; and online sales by Vitacost.com.

 (2) The 2017 Adjusted column represents the items presented in the 2017 column adjusted to remove the Extra Week.

 (3) This column represents the percentage change in 2017 adjusted sales, compared to 2016.

 (4) This column represents the percentage change in 2016, compared to 2015.

			The increase in total sales in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to the increase in adjusted sales and the Extra Week.  Total adjusted sales increased in 2017, compared to 2016, by 4.4%.  This increase was primarily due to our increases in total supermarket sales without fuel, fuel sales and our merger with Modern HC Holdings, Inc. (“ModernHEALTH”).  The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2017, adjusted for the Extra Week, compared to 2016, was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 0.7%, and an increase in supermarket square footage.  Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2017, compared to 2016, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, changes in product mix and product cost inflation of 0.7%, partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers.  Excluding mergers, acquisitions and operational closings, total supermarket square footage at the end of 2017 increased 1.9% over the end of 2016.  Total adjusted fuel sales increased 13.9% in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 12.3% and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 1.4%.  The increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel.

			Total sales increased in 2016, compared to 2015, by 5.0%.  This increase was primarily due to our increase in total supermarket sales, without fuel, and our merger with ModernHEALTH, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to a 9.4% decrease in the average retail fuel price.  The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to our merger with Roundy’s, an increase in supermarket square footage and our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 1.0%.  Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2016, compared to 2015, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, partially offset by product cost deflation of 0.8%.  Excluding mergers, acquisitions and operational closings, total supermarket square footage at the end of 2016 increased 3.4% over 2015.  Total fuel sales decreased 5.6% in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 9.4%, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 4.2%.  The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel.

			We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters.  Although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies.  Fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in-store purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results.  Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage.  Identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical multi-department stores.  Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the following table.  We used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2017 and 2016.

 Identical Supermarket Sales

 ($ in millions)

---------------------------------- ---- ------- -------- - ------- -
 2017 2016 (1)
Including supermarket fuel centers $ 109,161 $ 107,135
Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 96,639 $ 95,942
Including supermarket fuel centers 1.9 % 0.1 %
Excluding supermarket fuel centers 0.7 % 1.0 %

 (1) Identical supermarket sales for 2016 were adjusted to a comparable 53 week basis by including week 1 of fiscal 2017 in our 2016 identical supermarket sales base. However, for purposes of determining the percentage change in identical supermarket sales from 2015 to 2016, 2016 identical supermarket sales were not adjusted to include the sales from week 1 of 2017.

 Gross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin

			We define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation.    Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in gross margin.

			Our gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.01% in 2017, 22.40% in 2016 and 22.16% in 2015.  The  decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its lower gross margin rate, and increased warehousing, transportation and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by improved merchandise costs, a lower LIFO charge, a change in our product sales mix, including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales, growth in Our Brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products, decreased advertising costs, as a percentage of sales, and a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales.

			The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from lower fuel sales, a lower LIFO charge and our merger with Roundy’s due to its historically higher gross margin rate, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its historically lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales.

			Our LIFO credit for 2017 was $8 million, compared to a LIFO charge of $19 million in 2016 and $28 million in 2015.  Our LIFO credit in 2017 was primarily due to a reduction of pharmacy inventory in 2017 compared to 2016.  In 2016, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation in other departments. In 2015, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy.

			Our FIFO gross margin rates, which exclude the LIFO credit and charge, were 22.01% in 2017, 22.42% in 2016 and 22.18% in 2015.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week and ModernHEALTH, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016.  This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, increased warehousing, transportation and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by improved merchandise costs, a change in our product sales mix, including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales, growth in Our Brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products and decreased advertising costs, as a percentage of sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel and our mergers with Roundy’s and ModernHEALTH, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased seven basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales.

 Operating, General and Administrative Expenses

			OG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs and retirement plan costs; and utility and credit card fees.  Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A.

 18

			OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.58% in 2017, 16.63% in 2016 and 16.34% in 2015.  The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from the 2017 OG&A Adjusted Items, investing in our digital strategy, increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention, employee engagement and customer experience, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs, partially offset by savings from the VRO, effective cost controls, higher fuel sales, the 2016 Adjusted Items and our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its lower OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales.  Our fuel sales lower our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, the 2017 OG&A and 2016 Adjusted Items and ModernHEALTH, our OG&A rate increased 22 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016.  This increase resulted primarily from investing in our digital strategy, increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention, employee engagement and customer experience, increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs, partially offset by savings from the VRO and effective cost controls.

			The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales, the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, the 2016 Adjusted Items, our mergers with Roundy’s and ModernHEALTH due to their historically higher OG&A rate, compared to our other divisions, and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, partially offset by increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls, $110 million UFCW contributions made during 2015 (“2015 UFCW Contributions”) and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, as a percentage of sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, our OG&A rate decreased five basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, partially offset by the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, as a percentage of sales.

 Rent Expense

			Rent expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017, compared to 2016, due to our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing, whenever possible, and higher fuel sales, which decreases our rent expense, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased closed store liabilities.

			Rent expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2016, compared to 2015, due to our merger with Roundy’s, due to its higher volume of leased versus owned supermarkets, and lower fuel sales, which increases our rent expense rate, as a percentage of sales.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense

			Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017, compared to 2016, due to higher fuel sales, which decreases our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales, the Extra Week and the 2017 Depreciation Adjusted Item, partially offset by additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.0 billion, during 2017.

			Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of sales 2016, compared to 2015, due to additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.6 billion, during 2016, unfavorable sales leveraging from transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, and our merger with Roundy’s.

 Operating Profit and FIFO Operating Profit

			Operating profit was $2.1 billion in 2017, $3.4 billion in 2016 and $3.6 billion in 2015.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 1.70% in 2017, 2.98% in 2016 and 3.26% in 2015.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 128 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016, due to a lower gross margin and increased OG&A, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses and a lower LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales.

 19

			Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 28 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015, due to increased OG&A, depreciation and amortization and rent expenses, partially offset by higher gross margin and a lower LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales.

			FIFO operating profit was $2.1 billion in 2017, $3.5 billion in 2016 and $3.6 billion in 2015.  FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 1.69% in 2017, 3.00% in 2016 and 3.28% in 2015.  Fuel sales lower our operating profit rate due to the very low operating profit rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the Extra Week, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, the 2017 and 2016 Adjusted Items and ModernHEALTH, decreased 46 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016, due to a lower gross margin and increased OG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales.

			FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, the effects of our recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, decreased 14 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease was due to lower gross margin, higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by decreased OG&A and rent expenses, as a percentage of sales.

 Specific factors of the above operating trends under operating profit and FIFO operating profit are discussed earlier in this section.

 Interest Expense

			Interest expense totaled $601 million in 2017, $522 million in 2016 and $482 million in 2015.  The increase in interest expense in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases, the Extra Week, the $1.2 billion we contributed to company-sponsored and company-managed pension plans in 2017, a $467 million pre-tax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate.  The increase in interest expense in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases, mergers and a higher weighted average interest rate.

 Income Taxes

			Our effective income tax rate was (27.3)% in 2017, 32.8% in 2016 and 33.8% in 2015.  The 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the Tax Act, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and the effect of state income taxes.  The 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments after the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.  The 2015 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.

 Net Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share

 Our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section.

			Net earnings of $2.09 per diluted share in 2017 represented an increase of 2.0% from net earnings of $2.05 per diluted share in 2016.  Excluding the 2017 and 2016 Adjusted Items and the Extra Week, adjusted net earnings of $1.95 per diluted share in 2017 represented a decrease of 8.0% from adjusted net earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2016.  The 8.0% decrease in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from lower non-fuel FIFO operating profit and increased interest expense, partially offset by higher fuel earnings, a lower LIFO charge, decreased income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases.

			Net earnings of $2.05 per diluted share in 2016 represented a decrease of 0.5% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015.  Excluding the 2016 Adjusted Items, net earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2016 represented an increase of 2.9% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015.  The net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items.  The 2.9% increase resulted primarily from a lower LIFO charge, lower income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases, partially offset by lower non-fuel FIFO operating profit and lower fuel earnings.

 20

 COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

			We maintain share repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time.  The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time.  We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $1.6 billion in 2017, $1.7 billion in 2016 and $500 million in 2015 under these repurchase programs.  In addition to these repurchase programs, we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans.  This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises.  We repurchased approximately $66 million in 2017, $105 million in 2016 and $203 million in 2015 of our common shares under the stock option program.

 The shares repurchased in 2017 were reacquired under the following repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors to reacquire shares via open market purchases:

 · On September 15, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program (the “September 2016 Repurchase Program”). This program was exhausted during the first quarter of 2017.

 · On March 9, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program to supplement the September 2016 Repurchase Program. This program was exhausted during the second quarter of 2017.

 · On June 22, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. As of February 3, 2018, there was $272 million remaining under this share repurchase program.

			On March 15, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, to supplement the June 2017 Repurchase Program, to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “March 2018 Repurchase Program”).

			During the first quarter through March 29, 2018, we used an additional $388 million of cash to repurchase 16 million common shares at an average price of $25.05 per share.  As of March 29, 2018, we have exhausted the June 2017 Repurchase Program and have $885 million remaining under the March 2018 Repurchase Program.

 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

			Capital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.0 billion in 2017, $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015.  Capital investments for mergers totaled $16 million in 2017, $401 million in 2016 and $168 million in 2015.  We merged with ModernHEALTH in 2016 and Roundy’s in 2015.  Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these mergers.  Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $13 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $35 million in 2015.  The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage:

 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL

			We calculate return on invested capital (“ROIC”) by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital.  Adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters.  Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve, (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and (iv) a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages, (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes and (v) the average liabilities held for sale.  Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two.  We use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors, analysts and rating agencies.  ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance.  ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.  ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital.  Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets.

			Although ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies.

Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

 (2) Other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of $1 as of January 28, 2017. We did not have any accrued income taxes as of February 3, 2018 or January 30, 2016. Accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

			We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

			The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 23

 Self-Insurance Costs

			We primarily are self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims.  The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through February 3, 2018.  We establish case reserves for reported claims using case-basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known.

			For both workers’ compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop-loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis.  We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits.  We account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate.  A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $3 million.  General liability claims are not discounted.

			The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims.  For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized.  Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs.  Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities.

 Impairments of Long-Lived Assets

			We monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred.  These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset.  When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores.  If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value.  Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows.  We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value.  With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions.  We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.  We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $71 million in 2017, $26 million in 2016 and $46 million in 2015.  We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as “Operating, general and administrative” expense.

			The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows.  Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition.  Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.

 Goodwill

			Our goodwill totaled $2.9 billion as of February 3, 2018.  We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events.  We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities (collectively, “reporting units”) that have goodwill balances.  Generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment.  We base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future.  We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

 24

			Our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter.  In 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment for our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy reporting unit totaling $110 million, $74 million net of tax.  The annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2016 and 2015 did not result in impairment.  Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely.  A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance.

			For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2017, 2016 and 2015 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

			The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates.  Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.  The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses.

 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

			We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized.

			The determination of our obligation and expense for company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts.  Those assumptions are described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs.  Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods.  While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense.  Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements also discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post-retirement benefit costs and the related liability.

			The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled.  In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans.  Our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows.  The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows.  The selection of the 4.00% and 3.93% discount rates as of year-end 2017 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an AA or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant.  We utilized a discount rate of 4.25% and 4.18% as of year-end 2016 for pension and other benefits, respectively.  A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of February 3, 2018, by approximately $426 million.

 25

			Our 2017 assumed pension plan investment return rate was 7.50% compared to 7.40% in 2016 and 7.44% in 2015.  The value of all investments in our company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2017, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased 8.7%.  Historically, the Kroger pension plans’ average rate of return was 5.7% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2017, net of all investment management fees and expenses.  For the past 20 years, the Kroger pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been 7.10%.  At the beginning of 2017, to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by Kroger for 2017, we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories.  Based on this information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations, which contemplates our transition to a liability driven investment strategy, we believed a 7.50% rate of return assumption was reasonable for 2017.  In 2016, Kroger began managing the assets for the Harris Teeter and Roundy’s pension plans, and our expected rate of return for 2016 reflects implementing a similar investment management strategy for the Harris Teeter and Roundy’s plans’ assets.  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets.

			On January 31, 2015, we adopted new industry specific mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in determining our benefit obligations. On January 28, 2017, we adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement, based on additional years of published mortality experience.

 Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below (in millions).

------------------------- ------------ ------------------- --------- ------------------- - -------
 Projected Benefit
 Percentage Obligation Expense
 Point Change Decrease/(Increase) Decrease/(Increase)
Discount Rate +/- 1.0% $ 426/(516) $ 39/(49)
Expected Return on Assets +/- 1.0% — $ 31/(31)

			In 2017, we contributed $1.0 billion to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans and we are not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2018.  We contributed $3 million to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans in 2016 and $5 million in 2015.  Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of contributions.

			In 2017, we settled certain company-sponsored pension plan obligations using existing assets of the plan and the $1.0 billion contribution.  We recognized a settlement charge of approximately $502 million, $335 million net of tax, associated with the settlement of our obligations for the eligible participants’ pension balances that were distributed out of the plan via a transfer to other qualified retirement plan options, a lump sum payout, or the purchase of an annuity contract, based on each participant’s election.

			We contributed and expensed $219 million in 2017, $215 million in 2016 and $196 million in 2015 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, is primarily due to our recent mergers.  The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation and length of service.

 Multi-Employer Pension Plans

			We contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements.  These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.  The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose.  Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions.  The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.

			We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP.  We made cash contributions to these plans of $954 million in 2017, $289 million in 2016 and $426 million in 2015.  The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to the $467 million pre-tax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund and the 2017 UFCW Contribution.

 26

			We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans.  These under-fundings are not our liability.  When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan.  The commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating.  We are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”) Consolidated Pension Fund and have sole investment authority over these assets.  As such, we include contributions to these plans when we disclose contributions to company-sponsored and company-managed pension plans.  We became the fiduciary of the IBT Consolidated Pension Fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the IBT that provided our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund.  Significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are:

 · In 2017, we incurred a $550 million charge, $360 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawing from and settlements for withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, of which $467 million was contributed to the Central States Pension Fund in 2017.

 · In 2017, we contributed an incremental $111 million, $71 million net of tax, to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan.

 · In 2016, we incurred a charge of $111 million, $71 million net of tax, due to commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from the restructuring of certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, of which $28 million was contributed to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2016.

 · In 2015, we contributed $190 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. We had previously accrued $60 million of the total contributions at January 31, 2015 and recorded expense for the remaining $130 million at the time of payment in 2015.

 As we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds.

			Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits.  We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2017.  Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding.  Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer.  As of December 31, 2017, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, or as it relates to certain funds, an estimated withdrawal liability, was approximately $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion net of tax.  This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $700 million, $446 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016.  The decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to withdrawing from and settlements for withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, the 2017 UFCW Contribution and returns on assets in the funds.  Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable.

			We have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours.  Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences.  In the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP.

 27

			The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements.  The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation.  On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation.  We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans.  Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made.

 See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans.

 Inventories

			Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market.  In total, approximately 93% and 89% of inventories were valued using the LIFO method in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The remaining inventories, including substantially all fuel inventories, are stated at the lower of cost (on a FIFO basis) or net realizable  value.  Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $1.2 billion at February 3, 2018 and $1.3 billion at January 28, 2017.  We follow the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit.

			We follow the item-cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions.  This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold.  The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory.  In addition, substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts).

			We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities.  We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date.

 Vendor Allowances

			We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold.  In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item.  When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold.  We recognized approximately $8.5 billion in 2017, $7.8 billion in 2016 and $7.3 billion in 2015 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs.  We recognized approximately 93% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns.

 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

			In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.” This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This amendment became effective for us beginning January 31, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 28

			During the second quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”  This amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. As a result of the adoption, we recognized $49 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in our provision for income taxes in 2016. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. In addition, for 2016, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity. Cash paid on employees’ behalf related to shares withheld for tax purposes is classified as a financing activity. Retrospective application of the cash flow presentation requirements resulted in increases to both “Net cash provided by operating activities” and “Net cash used by financing activities” of $59 million for 2016 and $84 million for 2015.  Our stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.

			During 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205)”. This standard requires us to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the  Consolidated Financial Statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around our plan to alleviate these doubts are required. The adoption of this standard did not affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

			During 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement - Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (Topic 820)”.  This standard requires us to disclose which assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient, and ends the requirement to classify these assets within the GAAP fair value hierarchy.  See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures of assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient.

			In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” This amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This amendment became effective for us beginning January 29, 2017, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The implementation of this amendment resulted in the reclassification of current deferred tax liabilities as non-current and had no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-04 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.”  ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 requires applying a one-step quantitative test and recording the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment.  We performed our annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with this standard, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $110 million, $74 million net of tax, related to our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy reporting unit.

			In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, as amended by several subsequent ASUs, which provides guidance for revenue recognition.  The standard’s overarching principle is that revenue must be recognized when goods and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that is proportionate to what has been delivered at that point and that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods or services.  Per ASU 2015-14, “Deferral of Effective Date,” this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 2, 2019.  We formed a project team to assess and document our accounting policies related to the new revenue guidance.  As of the end of 2017, we have completed this assessment and documentation.  Based on this project, we do not expect that the implementation of the new standard will have a material effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  We intend to adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis and will be addressing new disclosures regarding revenue recognition policies as required by the new standard at adoption.  During our assessment, we identified and will be implementing changes, at the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, to our accounting policies and practices, business processes, systems and controls to support the new revenue recognition and disclosure requirements.

 29

			In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements.  The standard’s core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets.  This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this ASU will result in a significant increase to our Consolidated Balance Sheets for lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  This evaluation process includes reviewing all forms of leases, performing a completeness assessment over the lease population, analyzing the practical expedients and assessing opportunities to make certain changes to our lease accounting information technology system in order to determine the best implementation strategy. We believe our current off-balance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating.

			In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.”  ASU 2017-07 requires an employer to report the service cost component of retiree benefits in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. ASU 2017-07 is effective for years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and requires retrospective application to all periods presented. This ASU will impact our Operating Profit subtotal as reported in our Consolidated Statement of Operations by excluding interest expense, investment returns, settlements and other non-service cost components of retiree benefit expenses. Information about interest expense, investment returns and other components of retiree benefit expenses can be found in Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

			In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.”  ASU 2018-02 amends ASC 220, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income,” to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, under the ASU 2018-02, we may be required to provide certain disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. ASU 2018-02 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Cash Flow Information

 Net cash provided by operating activities

			We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations in 2017, compared to $4.3 billion in 2016 and $4.9 billion in 2015.  The cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including non-controlling interests adjusted primarily for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, LIFO (credit) charge, stock compensation, expense for company-sponsored pension plans, goodwill impairment charge and deferred income taxes.  Changes in working capital created a net cash outflow in 2017 and 2016, and a net cash inflow for 2015.

			The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests, the $1.0 billion contribution to the company-sponsored defined benefit plans and deferred taxes, partially offset by an increase in non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.  Deferred taxes changed in 2017, compared to 2016, as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the Tax Act.

			The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in non-cash expenses, deferred taxes and lower payments on long-term liabilities.

 30

			Cash provided (used) by operating activities for changes in working capital was ($164) in 2017 compared to ($492) million in 2016 and $180 million in 2015.  The decrease in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the following:

 · A lower amount of cash used for inventory purchases due to decreased capital investments related to store growth,

 · Increased cash collections due to our emphasis on better receivables management, and

 · A lower increase, over the prior year, of prepaid benefit costs in 2017, compared to 2016; partially offset by

 · An overpayment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated income taxes, and

 · An increase in store deposits in-transit due to increased sales in the last few days of the year.

			 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to the net effect of the following:

 · Higher receivables due to increasing vendor allowance activity and pharmacy sales requiring third party payments,

 · Increased inventory purchases due to store growth and new distribution centers,

 · Higher prepayment of benefit costs,

 · Lower accrued expenses due to reduced incentive plan payout accruals, and

 · Lower tax payments due to a 2015 tax deduction associated with tangible property regulations.

 Net cash used by investing activities

			Cash used by investing activities was $2.7 billion in 2017, compared to $3.9 billion in 2016 and $3.6 billion in 2015.  The amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reduced cash payments for capital investments and lower payments for mergers.  The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased cash payments for capital investments and our merger with ModernHEALTH.

 Net cash used by financing activities

			Cash used by financing activities was $681 million in 2017, $352 million in 2016 and $1.3 billion in 2015.  The increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net long-term borrowings, partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases and higher net commercial paper borrowings.  The decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher long-term and commercial paper borrowings.

 Debt Management

			Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations, increased $1.5 billion to $15.6 billion as of year-end 2017 compared to 2016.  The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted from the issuance of (i) $400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.80%, (ii) $600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.70%, (iii) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 4.65% and (iv) increases in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by payments of $700 million on maturing long-term debt obligations.

 31

			Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations, increased $2.0 billion to $14.1 billion as of year-end 2016, compared to 2015.  The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted from the issuance of (i) $1.0 billion of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 4.45%, (ii) $750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.65%, (iii) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.875%, (iv) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 1.5%, (v) increases in commercial paper borrowings and  (vi) increases in capital lease obligations due to additional leased locations, partially offset by payments of $1.4 billion on maturing long-term debt obligations.

 Liquidity Needs

			We estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve-month period to approximate $6.9 billion, which includes anticipated requirements for working capital, capital investments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2017.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets.  Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months.  We have approximately $2.1 billion of commercial paper and $1.3 billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months, which is included in the $6.9 billion of estimated liquidity needs.  We expect to refinance this debt, in 2018, by issuing additional senior notes, a term loan or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience.  We currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the Company’s share repurchase programs and have a growing dividend, subject to Board approval.  We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions.

 Factors Affecting Liquidity

			We can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program.  At February 3, 2018, we had $2.1 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  Commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility.  If our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program.  This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity.  However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis.  Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our Public Debt Rating.  As of March 29, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.

			Our credit facility requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our “financial covenants”).  A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants are described below:

 · Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 2.45 to 1 as of February 3, 2018. If this ratio were to exceed 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired.

 · Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 4.49 to 1 as of February 3, 2018. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired.

			Our credit facility is more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year-end 2017.

 32

			The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of February 3, 2018 (in millions of dollars):

 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $1.0 billion in 2017. This table also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension plans, which totaled $954 million in 2017.

 (2) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.

 (3) As of February 3, 2018, we had $2.1 billion of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility.

 (4) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of February 3, 2018, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments.

 (5) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self-insurance liability related to workers’ compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis.

 (6) Amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 (7) Amounts include commitments, many of which are short-term in nature, to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

			As of February 3, 2018, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $1 billion), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on August 29, 2022.  Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, the commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit facility.  As of February 3, 2018, we had $2.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility.  The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $6 million as of February 3, 2018.

			In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of February 3, 2018, we had authorized for issuance $2.5 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 14, 2016.

 33

			We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers’ compensation claims.  These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels.   These bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs.  Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds.  Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements.  This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility.

			We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions.  We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations.  Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.  We have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including multi-employer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities.

			In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business.  Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans.  While our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability.

 OUTLOOK

			This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements about our future performance.  These statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it.  Such statements are indicated by words such as “will,” “would,” “could,” “continue,” “targeting,” “range,” “guidance,” “assume,” “possible,” “estimate,” “may,” “expect,” “goal,” “should,” “intend,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

			Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially.

 · We are targeting identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 1.5% to 2.0% in 2018.

 · We expect net earnings to range from $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018.

 · We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3.0 billion in 2018.

 · We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.

 34

			Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  These include:

 · The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us, or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us. Our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets.

 

 · Our ability to achieve sales, earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by: labor negotiations or disputes; changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors, and the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates, the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities, and the unemployment rate; the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending; volatility of fuel margins; changes in government-funded benefit programs; manufacturing commodity costs; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery; changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs; stock repurchases; our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors; consolidation in the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers; our ability to negotiate modifications to multi-employer pension plans; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber-attacks or data security breaches; the success of our future growth plans; the successful integration of our acquired companies; and the successful completion of the sale of our convenience stores business. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above. Our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow.

 

 · Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities, and the deductibility of certain expenses.

 We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on our business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2018.

			Other factors and assumptions not identified above, including those discussed in Item 1A of this Report, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements made by us or our representatives.  We undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking information contained in this filing.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has n...

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Item 1A. Risk Factors 18

[discussed in Item 1A]:
Item 1A. Risk Factors 18

['s carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

 24

			Our annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter.  In 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment for our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy reporting unit totaling $110 million, $74 million net of tax.  The annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2016 and 2015 did not result in impairment.  Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely.  A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance.

			For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2017, 2016 and 2015 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

			The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates.  Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.  The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses.

 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

			We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized.

			The determination of our obligation and expense for company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts.  Those assumptions are described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs.  Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods.  While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense.  Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements also discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post-retirement benefit costs and the related liability.

			The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled.  In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans.  Our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows.  The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows.  The selection of the 4.00% and 3.93% discount rates as of year-end 2017 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an AA or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant.  We utilized a discount rate of 4.25% and 4.18% as of year-end 2016 for pension and other benefits, respectively.  A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of February 3, 2018, by approximately $426 million.

 25

			Our 2017 assumed pension plan investment return rate was 7.50% compared to 7.40% in 2016 and 7.44% in 2015.  The value of all investments in our company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2017, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased 8.7%.  Historically, the Kroger pension plans’ average rate of return was 5.7% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2017, net of all investment management fees and expenses.  For the past 20 years, the Kroger pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been 7.10%.  At the beginning of 2017, to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by Kroger for 2017, we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories.  Based on this information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations, which contemplates our transition to a liability driven investment strategy, we believed a 7.50% rate of return assumption was reasonable for 2017.  In 2016, Kroger began managing the assets for the Harris Teeter and Roundy’s pension plans, and our expected rate of return for 2016 reflects implementing a similar investment management strategy for the Harris Teeter and Roundy’s plans’ assets.  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets.

			On January 31, 2015, we adopted new industry specific mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in determining our benefit obligations. On January 28, 2017, we adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement, based on additional years of published mortality experience.

 Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Kroger’s pension plan liabilities is illustrated below (in millions).

------------------------- ------------ ------------------- --------- ------------------- - -------
 Projected Benefit
 Percentage Obligation Expense
 Point Change Decrease/(Increase) Decrease/(Increase)
Discount Rate +/- 1.0% $ 426/(516) $ 39/(49)
Expected Return on Assets +/- 1.0% — $ 31/(31)

			In 2017, we contributed $1.0 billion to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans and we are not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2018.  We contributed $3 million to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans in 2016 and $5 million in 2015.  Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of contributions.

			In 2017, we settled certain company-sponsored pension plan obligations using existing assets of the plan and the $1.0 billion contribution.  We recognized a settlement charge of approximately $502 million, $335 million net of tax, associated with the settlement of our obligations for the eligible participants’ pension balances that were distributed out of the plan via a transfer to other qualified retirement plan options, a lump sum payout, or the purchase of an annuity contract, based on each participant’s election.

			We contributed and expensed $219 million in 2017, $215 million in 2016 and $196 million in 2015 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, is primarily due to our recent mergers.  The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation and length of service.

 Multi-Employer Pension Plans

			We contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements.  These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.  The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose.  Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions.  The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.

			We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP.  We made cash contributions to these plans of $954 million in 2017, $289 million in 2016 and $426 million in 2015.  The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to the $467 million pre-tax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund and the 2017 UFCW Contribution.

 26

			We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans.  These under-fundings are not our liability.  When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan.  The commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating.  We are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”) Consolidated Pension Fund and have sole investment authority over these assets.  As such, we include contributions to these plans when we disclose contributions to company-sponsored and company-managed pension plans.  We became the fiduciary of the IBT Consolidated Pension Fund in 2017 due to the ratification of a new labor contract with the IBT that provided our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund.  Significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are:

 · In 2017, we incurred a $550 million charge, $360 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawing from and settlements for withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, of which $467 million was contributed to the Central States Pension Fund in 2017.

 · In 2017, we contributed an incremental $111 million, $71 million net of tax, to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan.

 · In 2016, we incurred a charge of $111 million, $71 million net of tax, due to commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from the restructuring of certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, of which $28 million was contributed to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2016.

 · In 2015, we contributed $190 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. We had previously accrued $60 million of the total contributions at January 31, 2015 and recorded expense for the remaining $130 million at the time of payment in 2015.

 As we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds.

			Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits.  We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2017.  Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding.  Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer.  As of December 31, 2017, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, or as it relates to certain funds, an estimated withdrawal liability, was approximately $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion net of tax.  This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $700 million, $446 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016.  The decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to withdrawing from and settlements for withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, the 2017 UFCW Contribution and returns on assets in the funds.  Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable.

			We have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours.  Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences.  In the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP.

 27

			The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements.  The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation.  On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation.  We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans.  Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made.

 See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans.

 Inventories

			Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market.  In total, approximately 93% and 89% of inventories were valued using the LIFO method in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The remaining inventories, including substantially all fuel inventories, are stated at the lower of cost (on a FIFO basis) or net realizable  value.  Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $1.2 billion at February 3, 2018 and $1.3 billion at January 28, 2017.  We follow the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit.

			We follow the item-cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions.  This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold.  The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory.  In addition, substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts).

			We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities.  We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date.

 Vendor Allowances

			We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold.  In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item.  When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold.  We recognized approximately $8.5 billion in 2017, $7.8 billion in 2016 and $7.3 billion in 2015 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs.  We recognized approximately 93% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns.

 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

			In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.” This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This amendment became effective for us beginning January 31, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 28

			During the second quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”  This amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. As a result of the adoption, we recognized $49 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in our provision for income taxes in 2016. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. In addition, for 2016, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity. Cash paid on employees’ behalf related to shares withheld for tax purposes is classified as a financing activity. Retrospective application of the cash flow presentation requirements resulted in increases to both “Net cash provided by operating activities” and “Net cash used by financing activities” of $59 million for 2016 and $84 million for 2015.  Our stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.

			During 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205)”. This standard requires us to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the  Consolidated Financial Statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around our plan to alleviate these doubts are required. The adoption of this standard did not affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

			During 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement - Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (Topic 820)”.  This standard requires us to disclose which assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient, and ends the requirement to classify these assets within the GAAP fair value hierarchy.  See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures of assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient.

			In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” This amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This amendment became effective for us beginning January 29, 2017, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The implementation of this amendment resulted in the reclassification of current deferred tax liabilities as non-current and had no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-04 "]:

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

			In addition, net earnings include $119 million, $79 million net of tax, due to a 53rd week in fiscal year 2017 (the “Extra Week”).

			 Net earnings for 2016 include $111 million, $71 million net of tax, of charges to OG&A related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits (the “2016 Adjusted Items”).  There were no adjusted items in 2015.

			We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus net cash used by investing activities.  Free cash flow is an important measure used by management to evaluate available funding for share repurchases, dividends, other strategic investments and managing debt levels.  Management believes free cash flow is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it demonstrates our ability to make share repurchases and other strategic investments, pay dividends and manage debt levels.

 (4) This column represents the percentage change in 2016, compared to 2015.

			The increase in total sales in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to the increase in adjusted sales and the Extra Week.  Total adjusted sales increased in 2017, compared to 2016, by 4.4%.  This increase was primarily due to our increases in total supermarket sales without fuel, fuel sales and our merger with Modern HC Holdings, Inc. (“ModernHEALTH”).  The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2017, adjusted for the Extra Week, compared to 2016, was primarily due to our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 0.7%, and an increase in supermarket square footage.  Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2017, compared to 2016, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, changes in product mix and product cost inflation of 0.7%, partially offset by our continued investments in lower prices for our customers.  Excluding mergers, acquisitions and operational closings, total supermarket square footage at the end of 2017 increased 1.9% over the end of 2016.  Total adjusted fuel sales increased 13.9% in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 12.3% and an increase in fuel gallons sold of 1.4%.  The increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel.

			Total sales increased in 2016, compared to 2015, by 5.0%.  This increase was primarily due to our increase in total supermarket sales, without fuel, and our merger with ModernHEALTH, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to a 9.4% decrease in the average retail fuel price.  The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to our merger with Roundy’s, an increase in supermarket square footage and our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 1.0%.  Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2016, compared to 2015, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, partially offset by product cost deflation of 0.8%.  Excluding mergers, acquisitions and operational closings, total supermarket square footage at the end of 2016 increased 3.4% over 2015.  Total fuel sales decreased 5.6% in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 9.4%, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 4.2%.  The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel.

			We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters.  Although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies.  Fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in-store purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results.  Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage.  Identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical multi-department stores.  Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the following table.  We used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2017 and 2016.

 Identical Supermarket Sales

 ($ in millions)

---------------------------------- ---- ------- -------- - ------- -
 2017 2016 (1)
Including supermarket fuel centers $ 109,161 $ 107,135
Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 96,639 $ 95,942
Including supermarket fuel centers 1.9 % 0.1 %
Excluding supermarket fuel centers 0.7 % 1.0 %

 (1) Identical supermarket sales for 2016 were adjusted to a comparable 53 week basis by including week 1 of fiscal 2017 in our 2016 identical supermarket sales base. However, for purposes of determining the percentage change in identical supermarket sales from 2015 to 2016, 2016 identical supermarket sales were not adjusted to include the sales from week 1 of 2017.

 Gross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin

			We define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation.    Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in gross margin.

			Our gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.01% in 2017, 22.40% in 2016 and 22.16% in 2015.  The  decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its lower gross margin rate, and increased warehousing, transportation and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by improved merchandise costs, a lower LIFO charge, a change in our product sales mix, including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales, growth in Our Brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products, decreased advertising costs, as a percentage of sales, and a higher gross margin rate on fuel sales.

			The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from lower fuel sales, a lower LIFO charge and our merger with Roundy’s due to its historically higher gross margin rate, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its historically lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales.

			Our LIFO credit for 2017 was $8 million, compared to a LIFO charge of $19 million in 2016 and $28 million in 2015.  Our LIFO credit in 2017 was primarily due to a reduction of pharmacy inventory in 2017 compared to 2016.  LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy.

			Our FIFO gross margin rates, which exclude the LIFO credit and charge, were 22.01% in 2017, 22.42% in 2016 and 22.18% in 2015.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week and ModernHEALTH, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016.  This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, increased warehousing, transportation and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by improved merchandise costs, a change in our product sales mix, including higher gross margin perishable departments growing their percentage share of sales to total sales, growth in Our Brands products which have a higher gross margin compared to national brand products and decreased advertising costs, as a percentage of sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel and our mergers with Roundy’s and ModernHEALTH, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased seven basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales.

 Operating, General and Administrative Expenses

			OG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs and retirement plan costs; and utility and credit card fees.  Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A.

 18

			OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.58% in 2017, 16.63% in 2016 and 16.34% in 2015.  The increase in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from the 2017 OG&A Adjusted Items, investing in our digital strategy, increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention, employee engagement and customer experience, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs, partially offset by savings from the VRO, effective cost controls, higher fuel sales, the 2016 Adjusted Items and our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its lower OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales.  Our fuel sales lower our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the Extra Week, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, the 2017 OG&A and 2016 Adjusted Items and ModernHEALTH, our OG&A rate increased 22 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016.  This increase resulted primarily from investing in our digital strategy, increases in store wages attributed to investing in incremental labor hours and higher wages to improve retention, employee engagement and customer experience, increases in incentive plan and healthcare costs, partially offset by savings from the VRO and effective cost controls.

			The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales, the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, the 2016 Adjusted Items, our mergers with Roundy’s and ModernHEALTH due to their historically higher OG&A rate, compared to our other divisions, and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, partially offset by increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls, $110 million UFCW contributions made during 2015 (“2015 UFCW Contributions”) and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, as a percentage of sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, our OG&A rate decreased five basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, partially offset by the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, as a percentage of sales.

 Rent Expense

			Rent expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017, compared to 2016, due to our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing, whenever possible, and higher fuel sales, which decreases our rent expense, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased closed store liabilities.

			Rent expense increased as a percentage of sales in 2016, compared to 2015, due to our merger with Roundy’s, due to its higher volume of leased versus owned supermarkets, and lower fuel sales, which increases our rent expense rate, as a percentage of sales.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense

			Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of sales in 2017, compared to 2016, due to higher fuel sales, which decreases our depreciation expense as a percentage of sales, the Extra Week and the 2017 Depreciation Adjusted Item, partially offset by additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.0 billion, during 2017.

			Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of sales 2016, compared to 2015, due to additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.6 billion, during 2016, unfavorable sales leveraging from transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, and our merger with Roundy’s.

 Operating Profit and FIFO Operating Profit

			Operating profit was $2.1 billion in 2017, $3.4 billion in 2016 and $3.6 billion in 2015.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 1.70% in 2017, 2.98% in 2016 and 3.26% in 2015.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 128 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016, due to a lower gross margin and increased OG&A, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses and a lower LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales.

 19

			Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 28 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015, due to increased OG&A, depreciation and amortization and rent expenses, partially offset by higher gross margin and a lower LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales.

			FIFO operating profit was $2.1 billion in 2017, $3.5 billion in 2016 and $3.6 billion in 2015.  FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 1.69% in 2017, 3.00% in 2016 and 3.28% in 2015.  Fuel sales lower our operating profit rate due to the very low operating profit rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the Extra Week, the 2017 UFCW Contribution, the 2017 and 2016 Adjusted Items and ModernHEALTH, decreased 46 basis points in 2017, compared to 2016, due to a lower gross margin and increased OG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales.

			FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, the effects of our recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, decreased 14 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015.  This decrease was due to lower gross margin, higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by decreased OG&A and rent expenses, as a percentage of sales.

 Specific factors of the above operating trends under operating profit and FIFO operating profit are discussed earlier in this section.

 Interest Expense

			Interest expense totaled $601 million in 2017, $522 million in 2016 and $482 million in 2015.  The increase in interest expense in 2017, compared to 2016, resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases, the Extra Week, the $1.2 billion we contributed to company-sponsored and company-managed pension plans in 2017, a $467 million pre-tax payment to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate.  The increase in interest expense in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases, mergers and a higher weighted average interest rate.

 Income Taxes

			Our effective income tax rate was (27.3)% in 2017, 32.8% in 2016 and 33.8% in 2015.  The 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of remeasuring deferred taxes due to the Tax Act, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and the effect of state income taxes.  The 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments after the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.  The 2015 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.

 Net Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share

 Our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section.

			Net earnings of $2.09 per diluted share in 2017 represented an increase of 2.0% from net earnings of $2.05 per diluted share in 2016.  Excluding the 2017 and 2016 Adjusted Items and the Extra Week, adjusted net earnings of $1.95 per diluted share in 2017 represented a decrease of 8.0% from adjusted net earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2016.  The 8.0% decrease in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from lower non-fuel FIFO operating profit and increased interest expense, partially offset by higher fuel earnings, a lower LIFO charge, decreased income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases.

			Net earnings of $2.05 per diluted share in 2016 represented a decrease of 0.5% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015.  Excluding the 2016 Adjusted Items, net earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2016 represented an increase of 2.9% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015.  The net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items.  The 2.9% increase resulted primarily from a lower LIFO charge, lower income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases, partially offset by lower non-fuel FIFO operating profit and lower fuel earnings.

 20

 COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

			We maintain share repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time.  The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time.  We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $1.6 billion in 2017, $1.7 billion in 2016 and $500 million in 2015 under these repurchase programs.  In addition to these repurchase programs, we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans.  This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises.  We repurchased approximately $66 million in 2017, $105 million in 2016 and $203 million in 2015 of our common shares under the stock option program.

 The shares repurchased in 2017 were reacquired under the following repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors to reacquire shares via open market purchases:

 · On September 15, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program (the “September 2016 Repurchase Program”). This program was exhausted during the first quarter of 2017.

 · On March 9, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program to supplement the September 2016 Repurchase Program. This program was exhausted during the second quarter of 2017.

 · On June 22, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. As of February 3, 2018, there was $272 million remaining under this share repurchase program.

			On March 15, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, to supplement the June 2017 Repurchase Program, to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “March 2018 Repurchase Program”).

			During the first quarter through March 29, 2018, we used an additional $388 million of cash to repurchase 16 million common shares at an average price of $25.05 per share.  As of March 29, 2018, we have exhausted the June 2017 Repurchase Program and have $885 million remaining under the March 2018 Repurchase Program.

 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

			Capital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.0 billion in 2017, $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015.  Capital investments for mergers totaled $16 million in 2017, $401 million in 2016 and $168 million in 2015.  We merged with ModernHEALTH in 2016 and Roundy’s in 2015.  Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these mergers.  Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $13 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $35 million in 2015.  The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage:

 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL

			We calculate return on invested capital (“ROIC”) by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital.  Adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters.  Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve, (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and (iv) a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages, (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes and (v) the average liabilities held for sale.  Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two.  We use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors, analysts and rating agencies.  ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance.  ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.  ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital.  Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets.

			Although ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies.

 (1) Taxes receivable were $229 as of February 3, 2018, $132 as of January 28, 2017 and $392 as of January 30, 2016. The January 30, 2016 balance is higher than the other comparative balances due to changes to tangible property regulations in 2015. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

 (2) Other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of $1 as of January 28, 2017. We did not have any accrued income taxes as of February 3, 2018 or January 30, 2016. Accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

			We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

			The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 Self-Insurance Costs

			We primarily are self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims.  The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through February 3, 2018.  We establish case reserves for reported claims using case-basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known.

			For both workers’ compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop-loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis.  We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits.  We account for the liabilities for workers’ compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate.  A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $3 million.  General liability claims are not discounted.

			The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims.  For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized.  Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs.  Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities.

 Impairments of Long-Lived Assets

			We monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred.  These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset.  When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores.  If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value.  Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows.  We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value.  With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions.  We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.  We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $71 million in 2017, $26 million in 2016 and $46 million in 2015.  We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as “Operating, general and administrative” expense.

			The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows.  Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition.  Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.

 Goodwill

			Our goodwill totaled $2.9 billion as of February 3, 2018.  We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events.  We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities (collectively, “reporting units”) that have goodwill balances.  Generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment.  We base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future.  We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting unit']:
