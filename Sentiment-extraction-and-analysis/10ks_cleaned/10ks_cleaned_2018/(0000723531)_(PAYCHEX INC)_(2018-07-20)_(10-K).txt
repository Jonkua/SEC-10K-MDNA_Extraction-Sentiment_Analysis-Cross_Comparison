Our financial results for fiscal 2018 reflect another year of steady growth.  HRS revenue continued to experience strong growth of 14% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across the following HCM services:  comprehensive HR outsourcing services, including HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (“HROI”) acquired in fiscal 2018; retirement services; time and attendance; and insurance services.  Payroll service revenue increased 2% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of our price increases, net of discounts. As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor Group (“Lessor”) acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  As of May 31, 2017, we served approximately 605,000 payroll clients.  Client retention was approximately 81% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year, consistent with a year ago.

			Interest rates available on high-quality financial instruments are gradually increasing. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for fiscal 2018, compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2017 and 1.1% for fiscal 2016.  The United States (“U.S.”) Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by a total of 75 basis points during fiscal 2018 to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of May 31, 2018.  In June 2018, the Federal Funds rate was raised an additional 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2.0%.  The Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.75% to 1.0% as of May 31, 2017.

			Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, are as follows:

 · Total revenue increased 7% to $3.4 billion.

 o HRS revenue increased 14% to $1.5 billion.

 o Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.8 billion.

 o Interest on funds held for clients increased 26% to $63.5 million.

 · Operating income increased 4% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating income(1) increased 6% to $1.3 billion.

 · Net income increased 14% to $933.7 million. Adjusted net income(1) increased 15% to $920.0 million.

 · Diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.58 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) increased 16% to $2.55 per share.

 · Dividends of $739.7 million were paid to stockholders, representing 79% of net income.

 (1) Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7 for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.

 Business Outlook

			Our payroll client base, including Lessor, exceeded 650,000 clients as of May 31, 2018, and was approximately 605,000 clients as of May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016.  Excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

			While HRS products provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll, they effectively leverage payroll processing data.  Our HR administration services are included as part of the integrated HCM solution within Paychex Flex.  The following table illustrates the growth in selected HRS service offerings:

			In fiscal 2018, we expanded our commitment to delivering superior technology and service solutions to our Paychex clients.  New offerings introduced in fiscal 2018 included:

 · Accountant HQ, a Paychex Flex platform-based offering, which provides access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts to assist a client’s accountant in driving greater efficiency;

			Concentrated effort remains on the continued enhancements of Paychex Flex, our robust cloud-based HCM platform, which allows direct client access to payroll, HR, and benefits information in a streamlined and integrated approach to workplace management.

			We continue to strengthen our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, small businesses, and other interested parties.  We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes.  The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance, helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.  Both this website and www.paychex.com/worx have sections dedicated to the topic of health care reform.

 Financial position and liquidity

			Our financial position as of May 31, 2018 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $719.7 million and no debt. Our investment strategy continues to focus on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity.  We invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds – along with U.S. government agency securities and corporate bonds. During fiscal 2018, our primary short-term investment vehicles were Variable Rate Demand Notes (“VRDNs”) and bank demand deposit accounts.

			A majority of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2018 that were in an unrealized loss position were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.

			Our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations. Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018.   Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities.  Our positive operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. In April 2018 and July 2017, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.56 per share from $0.50 per share, and 9% to $0.50 per share from $0.46 per share, respectively.  Dividends paid to stockholders were 79% of net income for fiscal 2018. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2018, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, dividend payments, and business acquisitions, if any, for the foreseeable future.

			For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, and our financial position as of May 31, 2018, refer to the tables and analysis in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of this Item 7.

Payroll service revenue:  Payroll service revenue was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.8 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods.  Both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from increases in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts.  The impact of the acquisition of Lessor on payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2018 was insignificant.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2017.

			As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  For fiscal 2017, our total payroll client base of 605,000 was comparable to fiscal 2016.  Client retention was approximately 81% of the beginning client base for fiscal 2018, consistent with fiscal 2017.  Client retention was approximately 82% of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2016.

			Human Resource Services revenue:  HRS revenue was $1.5 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods. HROI contributed approximately 6% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2018 and Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2017.

			For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across all major HCM services, including: comprehensive HR outsourcing services (including HROI), retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.  HRS product key statistics are as follows:

Asset value of retirement services participants’ funds $ 30.6 12 % $ 27.4 16 % $ 23.6

			 (1) The total number of worksite employees and clients for fiscal 2018 include HROI.

			We continue to experience strong demand for our Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, as evidenced by the continued strong growth in client worksite employees for both our ASO and PEO. Retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participant funds, along with an increase in the number of plans served. Insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants.  In addition, for fiscal 2017, revenue was positively impacted by higher average premiums in our workers’ compensation insurance product.

 ﻿

			Total service revenue:  Total service revenue increased 7% for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, attributable to the factors previously discussed.

			Interest on funds held for clients:  Interest on funds held for clients increased 26% for fiscal 2018 and 10% for fiscal 2017 to $63.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively.  For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the increases were primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.

			Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) on employee withholdings and changes in client mix, which offset the impact of wage inflation.  Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impacts of timing of certain remittances due to taxing authorities and client mix.

			Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K for more information on changing interest rates.

Combined operating and SG&A expenses:  The following table summarizes total combined operating and SG&A expenses for fiscal years:

 ﻿

 ﻿

﻿
----------------------------- ---- ------- ------ -- ---- ------ ------- ---- -- - - -------
﻿
In millions 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016
Compensation-related expenses $ 1,242.4 5 % $ 1,188.5 4 % $ 1,148.2
Depreciation and amortization 138.0 9 % 126.9 10 % 115.1
PEO insurance costs 205.2 44 % 142.2 17 % 122.0
Other expenses 507.8 12 % 454.1 8 % 420.0
Total expenses $ 2,093.4 10 % $ 1,911.7 6 % $ 1,805.3

 ﻿

			Total expenses increased 10% for fiscal 2018 and 6% for fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount reflecting accelerated investment in technology, sales teams, and the impact of the acquisitions of Lessor and HROI.  In addition, compensation-related expenses in fiscal 2018 included a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees.  For fiscal 2017, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount in operations, partially offset by lower variable selling costs. As of May 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,300 employees, including Lessor, compared with 13,700 employees as of May 31, 2017.

			Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods.  The increase in depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service over the past two years as well as changes to the useful life of certain assets which accelerated depreciation expense recognition.

			Expense growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our PEO. Other expenses include items such as non-capital equipment, delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.  Continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, other expenses also reflect a one-time expense of $32.6 million related to the termination of certain license agreements.  In addition, the combined acquisitions of HROI and Lessor contributed approximately 5% to the total expense growth for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses for fiscal 2017.

			Operating income:  Operating income increased 4% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.   The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.  Operating income, as a percent of total revenue, was 38.1%, 39.3%, and 38.8% for the fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.  See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7 for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure.

			Investment income, net:  Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. Investment income, net, increased 66% for fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.  The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2018 was the result of higher net income partially offset by share repurchases, business acquisitions, and an increase in the rate for quarterly dividend payments.  Investment income, net, increased 13% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average investment balances.

			Income taxes:  Our effective income tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2018 and was 34.3% for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.  The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was significantly impacted by the Tax Act.  As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a non-recurring net tax benefit of $25.5 million for fiscal 2018 for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. This amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 per share for fiscal 2018.  In addition, as it relates to the Tax Act, our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 benefited from a reduced statutory tax rate applied to our current year taxable income.  The effective income tax rates were impacted by additional discrete tax items recognized during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016.  Effective June 1, 2016, we early-adopted new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments which resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized in income tax expense.  This discrete tax benefit impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  During fiscal 2018, we recognized a tax benefit as a result of the termination of certain license agreements, which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per diluted share.  During fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income derived in prior tax years related to customer-facing software that we produced which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per diluted share.  Additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant.  Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and diluted earnings per share:  Net income increased 14% to $933.7 million for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $817.3 million for fiscal 2017.  Diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.58 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $2.25 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. Adjusted net income increased 15% to $920.0 million for fiscal 2018 and increased 9% to $799.0 million for fiscal 2017.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $2.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2017, reflecting increases of 16% and 8%, respectively.  Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section that follows for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures.

In addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures.  We believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures, as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of GAAP and are not a required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  As such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and therefore should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures.  The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

			Our financial position as of May 31, 2018 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $719.7 million and no debt. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2018 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2018, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, if any, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

			Subsequent to May 31, 2018, we borrowed approximately $56.8 million under this line, which remains outstanding as of the date of this report.

 All of our credit facilities contain various financial and operational covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements. We were in compliance with all of these covenants as of May 31, 2018.

 ﻿

			Certain lenders under these credit facilities, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for us, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will continue to receive in the future, customary fees and expenses.

 ﻿

			Letters of credit:  As of May 31, 2018, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $56.8 million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2018 and May 2019. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2018 or as of May 31, 2018.  Subsequent to May 31, 2018, the letter of credit expiring in July 2018 was renewed through July 2019, and the total amount available under the letters of credit was increased $4.1 million to $60.9 million.

			Lines of credit: Effective August 17, 2017, we terminated four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit totaling $900.0 million.  The lines of credit were available to us at market rates of interest and were primarily used to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions made on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business.  There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit during fiscal 2018 or as of May 31, 2018.  We do not have any other open lines of credit as of the date of this report.

Other commitments:  We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2018. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of May 31, 2018:

 ﻿

Purchase obligations(2) 130.2 83.9 45.2 1.1 —
Total $ 240.3 $ 119.0 $ 91.8 $ 20.7 $ 8.8

 ﻿

 (1) Operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations.

 (2) Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase obligations is $6.7 million of commitments to purchase capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be different due to variable components of these agreements.

			The liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately $14.7 million as of May 31, 2018. Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above.

			Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long-term liabilities reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounting to $84.8 million as of May 31, 2018 are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments.  In addition, during fiscal 2017 we entered into a limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of $10.0 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector, of which approximately $4.2 million has been contributed as of May 31, 2018.  The timing of future contributions to be made to the venture capital fund cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above.

			In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.

			We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.

 ﻿

			In August 2017, we announced our plan for a new multi-building Paychex campus based in Rochester, NY.  This involves the purchase of five buildings and the renovation of over 300,000 square feet of existing space for an estimated cost of $60.0 million.  We completed the purchase of these buildings during the three months ended November 30, 2017, for a combined cost of approximately $34.7 million and placed approximately $16.0 million in escrow for the building renovations, which are in-process.  Renovations on the buildings purchased are in-process, and are expected to be substantially completed during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. In addition, in September 2017, we entered into a transaction with the County of Monroe Industrial Development Agency for purposes of obtaining public benefits and inducements, expiring on December 31, 2039.  The public inducements include exemption from sales and use taxes for goods and services directly related to the renovations of the new multi-building campus.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

			As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in both low-income housing projects and a venture capital fund focused on the financial technology sector.  These are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of May 31, 2018.

Operating Cash Flow Activities

﻿
﻿ Year ended May 31,
In millions 2018 2017 2016
Net income $ 933.7 $ 817.3 $ 756.8
Non-cash adjustments to net income 270.7 257.0 234.9
Cash provided by/(used in) changes in operating assets and liabilities 72.0 (113.9) 26.5
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,276.4 $ 960.4 $ 1,018.2

 ﻿

			The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 is the result of higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in cash provided by fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in net income in fiscal 2018 was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Act.  The decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of net cash outflows from fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items.  The increase in non-cash adjustments for fiscal 2018 and for fiscal 2017 was largely due to higher depreciation expense related to an increase in internally developed software placed in service over the last three years.  The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were impacted by the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.  In addition, the larger outflows in fiscal 2017 were impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (679.0) $ (424.6) $ (63.1)

 ﻿

			Funds held for clients and corporate investments:  Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

			Fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio.  Specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations.  Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 had greater purchases of short-term or available-for-sale investments of client collections than sales of investments to fund client fund remittances, whereas fiscal 2016 reflected more sales of investments than purchases.  For fiscal 2016, the client fund timing impacts reflected in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments were somewhat offset by a change in mix of investments.  Fiscal 2016 had more funds invested in VRDN securities and less in cash equivalents.

			In general, fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.  Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K.

			Other investing activities:  To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, we purchased approximately $0.5 million, $0.6 million, and $4.9 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The former Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board.

			The net cash outflow for purchases of property and equipment during fiscal 2018 includes the purchase of five buildings and ongoing renovations of over 300,000 square feet of existing space in Rochester, NY.  This new multi-building Paychex campus, announced in August 2017, will result in the consolidation of current leased space in the Rochester area.

Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, reflects our acquisitions of Lessor in February 2018, our acquisition of HROI in August 2017, and our acquisition of Advance Partners in December 2015. The Lessor and Advance Partners acquisition consideration was cash while the HROI acquisition was a combination of cash and common stock.

			Purchases of other assets relates primarily to client list acquisitions. During fiscal 2018, we resolved a contractual dispute with certain licensees. As it relates to this agreement, we acquired rights to certain client lists for approximately $30.0 million.

 ﻿

			Net change in client fund obligations:  The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days.

			Client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end.  Fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances.  May 31, 2018 fell on a Thursday, which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds.  These funds were then paid out on Friday June 1, 2018.  May 31, 2017 fell on a Wednesday compared to May 31, 2016 which was a Tuesday.  Payroll tax funds continued to be collected on Wednesday, May 31, 2017, yet the federal semi-weekly tax payment was delayed until Thursday, June 1, 2017 due to the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  As such, a higher client fund obligation existed on May 31, 2017 than May 31, 2016.  The timing of the Memorial Day holiday in May 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend, resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of May 31, 2016.  In addition, May 31, 2016 was a Tuesday, a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of Readychex and tax payments.

			Dividends paid:  In April 2018 and July 2017, our Board increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders by 12% to $0.56 per share from $0.50 per share, and by 9% to $0.50 per share from $0.46 per share, respectively. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 79%, 81%, and 80% for fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow, and is subject to the discretion of our Board.

			Repurchases of common shares:   In July 2016, our Board approved a program to repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock, authorized through May 31, 2019 (the “July 2016 Program”).  The purpose of the July 2016 Program is to manage common stock dilution.  During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total of $143.1 million.  During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166.2 million.  Of the shares repurchased during fiscal 2017, $59.7 million was repurchased under a previously authorized common stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2016, we purchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $107.9 million, all under the previously authorized common stock repurchase program.  Shares repurchased were retired.

			Activity related to equity-based plans:  The decrease in cash flows related to stock-based awards for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and the increase for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.  Shares of common stock issued through the exercise of stock options were 0.6 million shares, 1.4 million shares, and 0.9 million shares for fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on our stock-based compensation plans.

Critical Accounting Policies

			Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

			Revenue recognition:  Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract.  The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

			For certain of our service offerings, we receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients.

			PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct pass-through costs billed and incurred, which primarily include payroll wages, payroll taxes, and certain benefit premiums.  Direct costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue.

			Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.

			 PEO insurance reserves:  As part of the PEO service, we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees.  Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policy with a national insurance carrier. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. In establishing the PEO workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

			With respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier. Under the minimum premium insurance arrangement, our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims.

			Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, workers' compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.  We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:  Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.  We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2018, it was determined that the Company has three reporting units. A qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2018, to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.

 We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

			Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the fiscal 2018, 2017, or 2016.

			Stock-based compensation costs:  All stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.  We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

			The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant.  For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.

			We estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.

			The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award.

			Refer to Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.

			Income taxes:  We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. With the early-adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, at the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Previously, we accounted for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 was the most comprehensive tax reform legislation approved in more than two decades and makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal corporate income taxation, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (a blended statutory tax rate of 29.2% for fiscal 2018); (ii) creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of officer compensation, interest, meals, entertainment, and other expenses; and (iii) changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system.  As a result of the Tax Act, we made a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and made a change in the Company’s annual effective income tax rate applied to income before income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2018.

			We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions.

Our financial results for fiscal 2018 reflect another year of steady growth.  HRS revenue continued to experience strong growth of 14% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across the following HCM services:  comprehensive HR outsourcing services, including HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (“HROI”) acquired in fiscal 2018; retirement services; time and attendance; and insurance services.  Payroll service revenue increased 2% for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of our price increases, net of discounts. As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor Group (“Lessor”) acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  As of May 31, 2017, we served approximately 605,000 payroll clients.  Client retention was approximately 81% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year, consistent with a year ago.

			Interest rates available on high-quality financial instruments are gradually increasing. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for fiscal 2018, compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2017 and 1.1% for fiscal 2016.  The United States (“U.S.”) Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by a total of 75 basis points during fiscal 2018 to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of May 31, 2018.  In June 2018, the Federal Funds rate was raised an additional 25 basis points to a range of 1.75% to 2.0%.  The Federal Funds rate was in the range of 0.75% to 1.0% as of May 31, 2017.

			Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, are as follows:

 · Total revenue increased 7% to $3.4 billion.

 o HRS revenue increased 14% to $1.5 billion.

 o Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.8 billion.

 o Interest on funds held for clients increased 26% to $63.5 million.

 · Operating income increased 4% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating income(1) increased 6% to $1.3 billion.

 · Net income increased 14% to $933.7 million. Adjusted net income(1) increased 15% to $920.0 million.

 · Diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.58 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) increased 16% to $2.55 per share.

 · Dividends of $739.7 million were paid to stockholders, representing 79% of net income.

 (1) Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7 for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.

 Business Outlook

			Our payroll client base, including Lessor, exceeded 650,000 clients as of May 31, 2018, and was approximately 605,000 clients as of May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016.  Excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

			While HRS products provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll, they effectively leverage payroll processing data.  Our HR administration services are included as part of the integrated HCM solution within Paychex Flex.  The following table illustrates the growth in selected HRS service offerings:

			In fiscal 2018, we expanded our commitment to delivering superior technology and service solutions to our Paychex clients.  New offerings introduced in fiscal 2018 included:

 · Accountant HQ, a Paychex Flex platform-based offering, which provides access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts to assist a client’s accountant in driving greater efficiency;

 · InVisionTM Iris Time Clock, a biometric clock that scans the iris, providing fast and accurate time capture;

 · Netspend’s Tip NetworkTM, which streamlines the process for paying tipped employees;

 · Do-It-Yourself online employee handbook; and

 · Onboarding Essentials, which enables clients to onboard new hires quickly and in a completely paperless fashion.

			Concentrated effort remains on the continued enhancements of Paychex Flex, our robust cloud-based HCM platform, which allows direct client access to payroll, HR, and benefits information in a streamlined and integrated approach to workplace management.

			We continue to strengthen our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, small businesses, and other interested parties.  We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes.  The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, www.paychex.com/group-health-insurance, helps small-business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.  Both this website and www.paychex.com/worx have sections dedicated to the topic of health care reform.

 Financial position and liquidity

			Our financial position as of May 31, 2018 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $719.7 million and no debt. Our investment strategy continues to focus on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity.  We invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds – along with U.S. government agency securities and corporate bonds. During fiscal 2018, our primary short-term investment vehicles were Variable Rate Demand Notes (“VRDNs”) and bank demand deposit accounts.

			A majority of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2018 that were in an unrealized loss position were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.

			Our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations. Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018.   Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities.  Our positive operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. In April 2018 and July 2017, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.56 per share from $0.50 per share, and 9% to $0.50 per share from $0.46 per share, respectively.  Dividends paid to stockholders were 79% of net income for fiscal 2018. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2018, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, dividend payments, and business acquisitions, if any, for the foreseeable future.

			For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, and our financial position as of May 31, 2018, refer to the tables and analysis in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of this Item 7.

 Table of Contents

Payroll service revenue:  Payroll service revenue was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.8 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods.  Both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from increases in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts.  The impact of the acquisition of Lessor on payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2018 was insignificant.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2017.

			As of May 31, 2018, including the Lessor acquisition, we served over 650,000 payroll clients.  For fiscal 2017, our total payroll client base of 605,000 was comparable to fiscal 2016.  Client retention was approximately 81% of the beginning client base for fiscal 2018, consistent with fiscal 2017.  Client retention was approximately 82% of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2016.

			Human Resource Services revenue:  HRS revenue was $1.5 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, reflecting growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods. HROI contributed approximately 6% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2018 and Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in HRS revenue for fiscal 2017.

			For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across all major HCM services, including: comprehensive HR outsourcing services (including HROI), retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.  HRS product key statistics are as follows:

Asset value of retirement services participants’ funds $ 30.6 12 % $ 27.4 16 % $ 23.6

			 (1) The total number of worksite employees and clients for fiscal 2018 include HROI.

			We continue to experience strong demand for our Paychex HR Services, our largest HRS revenue stream, as evidenced by the continued strong growth in client worksite employees for both our ASO and PEO. Retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participant funds, along with an increase in the number of plans served. Insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants.  In addition, for fiscal 2017, revenue was positively impacted by higher average premiums in our workers’ compensation insurance product.

 ﻿

			Total service revenue:  Total service revenue increased 7% for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, attributable to the factors previously discussed.

			Interest on funds held for clients:  Interest on funds held for clients increased 26% for fiscal 2018 and 10% for fiscal 2017 to $63.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively.  For both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the increases were primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.

			Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) on employee withholdings and changes in client mix, which offset the impact of wage inflation.  Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impacts of timing of certain remittances due to taxing authorities and client mix.

			Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K for more information on changing interest rates.

Combined operating and SG&A expenses:  The following table summarizes total combined operating and SG&A expenses for fiscal years:

 ﻿

 ﻿

﻿
----------------------------- ---- ------- ------ -- ---- ------ ------- ---- -- - - -------
﻿
In millions 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016
Compensation-related expenses $ 1,242.4 5 % $ 1,188.5 4 % $ 1,148.2
Depreciation and amortization 138.0 9 % 126.9 10 % 115.1
PEO insurance costs 205.2 44 % 142.2 17 % 122.0

Total expenses $ 2,093.4 10 % $ 1,911.7 6 % $ 1,805.3

 ﻿

			Total expenses increased 10% for fiscal 2018 and 6% for fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount reflecting accelerated investment in technology, sales teams, and the impact of the acquisitions of Lessor and HROI.  In addition, compensation-related expenses in fiscal 2018 included a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees.  For fiscal 2017, compensation-related expenses increased due to higher headcount in operations, partially offset by lower variable selling costs. As of May 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,300 employees, including Lessor, compared with 13,700 employees as of May 31, 2017.

			Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods.  The increase in depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service over the past two years as well as changes to the useful life of certain assets which accelerated depreciation expense recognition.

			Expense growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our PEO. Other expenses include items such as non-capital equipment, delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.  Continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, other expenses also reflect a one-time expense of $32.6 million related to the termination of certain license agreements.  In addition, the combined acquisitions of HROI and Lessor contributed approximately 5% to the total expense growth for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  The acquisition of Paychex Advance contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses for fiscal 2017.

			Operating income:  Operating income increased 4% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.   The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.  Operating income, as a percent of total revenue, was 38.1%, 39.3%, and 38.8% for the fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.  See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this Item 7 for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure.

			Investment income, net:  Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. Investment income, net, increased 66% for fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.  The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2018 was the result of higher net income partially offset by share repurchases, business acquisitions, and an increase in the rate for quarterly dividend payments.  Investment income, net, increased 13% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average investment balances.

			Income taxes:  Our effective income tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2018 and was 34.3% for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.  The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was significantly impacted by the Tax Act.  As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a non-recurring net tax benefit of $25.5 million for fiscal 2018 for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. This amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 per share for fiscal 2018.  In addition, as it relates to the Tax Act, our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 benefited from a reduced statutory tax rate applied to our current year taxable income.  The effective income tax rates were impacted by additional discrete tax items recognized during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016.  Effective June 1, 2016, we early-adopted new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments which resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized in income tax expense.  This discrete tax benefit impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  During fiscal 2018, we recognized a tax benefit as a result of the termination of certain license agreements, which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per diluted share.  During fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income derived in prior tax years related to customer-facing software that we produced which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per diluted share.  Additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant.  Refer to Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and diluted earnings per share:  Net income increased 14% to $933.7 million for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $817.3 million for fiscal 2017.  Diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.58 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and 8% to $2.25 per diluted share for fiscal 2017.  These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. Adjusted net income increased 15% to $920.0 million for fiscal 2018 and increased 9% to $799.0 million for fiscal 2017.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and $2.20 per diluted share for fiscal 2017, reflecting increases of 16% and 8%, respectively.  Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section that follows for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures.

In addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures.  We believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures, as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period.  Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of GAAP and are not a required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  As such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and therefore should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures.  The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days.

			Client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end.  Fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances.  May 31, 2018 fell on a Thursday, which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds.  These funds were then paid out on Friday June 1, 2018.  May 31, 2017 fell on a Wednesday compared to May 31, 2016 which was a Tuesday.  Payroll tax funds continued to be collected on Wednesday, May 31, 2017, yet the federal semi-weekly tax payment was delayed until Thursday, June 1, 2017 due to the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  As such, a higher client fund obligation existed on May 31, 2017 than May 31, 2016.  The timing of the Memorial Day holiday in May 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend, resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of May 31, 2016.  In addition, May 31, 2016 was a Tuesday, a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of Readychex and tax payments.

			PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct pass-through costs billed and incurred, which primarily include payroll wages, payroll taxes, and certain benefit premiums.  Direct costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue.

			Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.
