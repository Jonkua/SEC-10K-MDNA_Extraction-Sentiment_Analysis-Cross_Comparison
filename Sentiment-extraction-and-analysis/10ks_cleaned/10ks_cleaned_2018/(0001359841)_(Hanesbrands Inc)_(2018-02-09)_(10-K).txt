Overview
Our Company
We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Bonds, Maidenform, DIM, Bali, Playtex, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Berlei, Gear for Sports and Alternative. We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, activewear, socks and hosiery. Our brands hold either the number one or number two market position by units sold in many product categories and geographies in which we compete.
Acquisitions
On October 13, 2017, we acquired 100% of Alternative Apparel, Inc. (“Alternative Apparel”) from Rosewood Capital V, L.P. and certain individual shareholders in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $62 million on an enterprise value basis. Alternative Apparel sells the Alternative brand better basics T-shirts, fleece and other tops and bottoms. Alternative is a lifestyle brand known for its comfort, style and social responsibility. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and short term borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility. We believe this acquisition will create growth opportunities by supporting our Activewear growth strategy by expanding its market and channel penetration, including online, supported by our global low-cost supply chain and manufacturing network.
Our Segments
 Our operations are managed and reported in three operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear and International. These segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, we realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business will be managed and results will be reviewed by the chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker. The former Direct to Consumer segment, which consisted of our U.S. value-based (“outlet”) stores, legacy catalog business and U.S. retail Internet operations,

was eliminated. Our U.S. retail Internet operations, which sells products directly to consumers, is now reported in the respective Innerwear and Activewear segments. Other consists of our U.S. value-based (“outlet”) stores, U.S. hosiery business (previously reported in the Innerwear segment) and legacy catalog operations. Prior year segment sales and operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.
The reportable segments are as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of men’s underwear, panties, children’s underwear, socks and intimate apparel, which includes bras and shapewear.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature to both retailers and wholesalers, as well as licensed sports apparel and licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores, mass retailers and other channels.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• International primarily relates to the Europe, Australia, Asia, Latin America and Canada geographic locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.

Outlook for 2018
We expect 2018 net sales of $6.72 billion to $6.82 billion.
Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $207 million, combined.
We estimate our 2018 full-year tax rate to approach 16%.
We expect cash flow from operations to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $90 million to $100 million.
Business and Industry Trends
Inflation and Changing Prices
Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products. While we do not own yarn operations, we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large-scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins. Decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased, particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand, competition or other factors.
Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is affected by, among other factors, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton. Under our agreements with these suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases. When we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements, interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn. The yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers. However, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. The cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 4% of our cost of sales in 2017. Costs incurred today for materials and labor, including cotton, typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later.
Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodities and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold. In addition, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the United States and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income, which also could have a negative impact on spending.
Other Business and Industry Trends
The basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design details. Some products, however, such as intimate apparel, activewear and sheer hosiery, do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation. Our businesses face competition from

26

Table of Contents

other large corporations and foreign manufacturers, as well as smaller companies, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands.
Our top 10 customers accounted for 46% of our net sales in 2017. Our largest customers in 2017 were Wal-Mart and Target, which accounted for 18% and 13% of total sales, respectively. The increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products, while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products. To counteract these effects, it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today’s challenging economic environment. Brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand.
Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, an increasing portion of our revenue across all channels is being generated online and through mobile commerce applications. We are continuing to develop and expand our omnichannel capabilities to allow a consumer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store, at one of our retail or outlet stores or those of our retail partners, online or with a mobile device, through one of our branded websites, the website of one of our retail partners, or an online pureplay, such as Amazon. In addition to broadening our assortment of product offerings across all online channels, we are also increasing the proportion of our media budget dedicated to digital marketing.
Foreign Exchange Rates
Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways; a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results. Similar to many multi-national corporations that publish financial results in U.S. Dollars, our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated back into U.S. Dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. A period of strengthening in the U.S. Dollar results in a negative impact to our published financial results (because it would take more units of a local currency to convert into a dollar). The opposite is true during a period of weakening in the U.S. Dollar. Our biggest foreign currency exposure is the euro.
The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are purchased in U.S. Dollars. The transaction impact from a strengthening dollar would be negative to our financial results (because the U.S. Dollar-based costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units, which means a higher local-currency cost of goods, and in turn, a lower local-currency gross profit). The transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases. However, during periods of rapid change in exchange rates; pricing is unable to change quickly enough, therefore we hedge against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates.
Our Key Business Strategies
Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs.
The first element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our brand power. We seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value. Our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete. Internationally, our commercial markets include Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the United States will be concentrated over the next decade. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success. Our design, research and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends. We also support our key brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing campaigns.
The second element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is platform innovation. We are not interested in newness or fashion, but rather focus on identifying the long-term megatrends that will impact our categories over the next five to 10 years. Once we have identified these trends, we utilize a disciplined big-idea process to put more science into the art of apparel. Our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform, temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform and FreshIQ advanced odor protection technology fabric platform incorporate big-idea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and geographies. We are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale.

The third element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our low-cost global supply chain. We seek to expand margins through optimizing our low-cost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs. We believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design, marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors. Our global supply chain spans across both the Western and Eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply. Our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres, thereby diversifying our production risks. We have generated significant cost savings, margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size, scale and production capability.
We seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels. Our capital allocation strategy is to effectively deploy our significant, consistent cash flow to generate the best long-term returns for our shareholders. Our goal is to use our cash flow to fund capital investments and dividends, leverage debt for acquisitions and use excess cash flow for share repurchases.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. We generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.
Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, gasoline prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside our control. Consumers’ purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time.
Changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products, such as intimate apparel and men’s underwear, and lower margin products, such as activewear, fluctuate from time to time. In addition, sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time. Our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us, which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict. However, certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature, as sales of socks, hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays, while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers’ preferences and discretionary spending.
Tax Expense
As a global company, we are subject to income taxes and file income tax returns in more than 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. For the year ended December 30, 2017, a substantial majority of our foreign income was earned by our manufacturing and sourcing operations in El Salvador, Hong Kong, Dominican Republic and Thailand. The relatively lower effective tax rates in these jurisdictions as a result of favorable local tax regimes and various free trade zone agreements significantly reduced our consolidated effective tax rate. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower effective tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher effective tax rates, or by changes in tax laws or regulations.
In addition, future acquisitions may affect the proportion of our pre-tax income from foreign jurisdictions, both due to external sales and also increased volume in our self-owned supply chain. At the same time, a significant amount of the acquisition and integration costs (such as legal fees, bank fees and consulting fees) associated with these acquisitions is generally incurred in the U.S., which may decrease domestic taxable income. We follow a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on acquisitions that meet strict criteria for strong likely returns with relatively low risk. It is difficult to predict

28

Table of Contents

whether or when such acquisitions will occur and whether the acquisition targets will be foreign or domestic. Therefore, it is also difficult to predict the effect of acquisitions on the future distribution of our pre-tax income.
We maintain intercompany transfer pricing agreements governing sales within our self-owned supply chain, which can impact the amount of pre-tax income we recognize in foreign jurisdictions. In compliance with applicable tax laws, we regularly review the terms of these agreements utilizing independent third-party transfer pricing studies to ensure that intercompany pricing is consistent with what a seller would charge an independent, arm’s length customer, or what a buyer would pay an independent, arm’s length supplier. Therefore, changes in intercompany pricing are often driven by market conditions, which are also difficult to predict.
The recently enacted Tax Act significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, imposing a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We have estimated the impact of the newly enacted law incorporating assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the Tax Act. Some of the tax provisions that become effective in our fiscal year 2018 are expected to increase our effective tax rates, such as the GILTI tax. The actual impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act, as allowed under SAB 118.
As of December 30, 2017, we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. No additional U.S. federal income tax or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deemed to have been remitted as part of the one-time transition tax. We will continue to evaluate our permanent reinvestment assertion in light of the Tax Act. The accounting is expected to be completed within the measurement period, as allowed under SAB 118.
We regularly assess any significant exposure associated with increases in effective tax rates, and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustment to our tax provisions. See “Risk Factors - We have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our results.”

Under Project Booster, we are investing to accelerate worldwide omnichannel and global Champion growth, while also investing in marketing and brand building for our leading lineup of brands globally. To fund

29

Table of Contents

growth initiatives, reduce costs and increase cash flow, we expect to reduce overhead, including headcount, to reflect market trends and needs; drive additional supply chain optimization beyond integration synergies; and focus on inventory turns and other working capital improvements. We intend to use our size and scale to drive supply chain optimization, including by investing in our domestic distribution center network to better serve the online channel, gaining procurement and product development savings, utilizing global fabric platforms and silhouettes, and continuing to internalize production.
The Project Booster initiative is expected to generate approximately $150 million in annualized cost savings. We expect to annually reinvest approximately $50 million of the savings in targeted growth opportunities, which would result in approximately $100 million of annual net cost savings. We anticipate reaching the annual run rates for reinvestment and net cost savings by the end of 2019. In addition to the annual net cost savings, we also plan to drive approximately $200 million of non-recurring working capital improvements which will result in a one-time benefit to cash from operations by the end of 2019.

Net Sales
Higher net sales primarily due to the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Acquisitions of Hanes Australasia, Champion Europe and GTM in 2016 and Alternative Apparel in 2017, which added incremental net sales of approximately $470 million in 2017;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased net sales driven by our global Champion and global online growth initiatives;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased net sales in our licensed intimate apparel business, along with our sock and men’s underwear product categories;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Sales growth in licensed sports apparel in the college bookstore business; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $25 million.

Partially offset by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower net sales in our remaining Innerwear product categories as a result of challenging consumer traffic at retail, cautious inventory management by retailers and store closures within the mid-tier and department store channel;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower net sales in our licensed sports apparel business and Hanes activewear apparel within the mass merchant channel; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower net sales in Other driven by continued declines in hosiery, slower traffic at our outlet stores and the planned exit from our legacy catalog business in the third quarter of 2016.

Gross Profit
The increase in gross profit was attributable to higher sales volume primarily from acquisitions, supply chain efficiencies and synergies recognized from the integration of our acquisitions, offset in part by higher acquisition, integration and other action-related costs. Included within gross profit are charges of approximately $55 million and $39 million related to acquisition, integration and other action-related costs in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.9% in 2017 compared to 24.9% in 2016. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses were charges of $110 million and $99 million of acquisition, integration and other action-related costs in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The higher selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, resulted from higher distribution expenses as a result of increased volume, increased labor expenses to handle late-quarter customer orders, increased marketing investment, mix of products sold, as well as higher acquisition, integration and other action-related charges and expenses related to our Project Booster initiative including our U.S. corporate office headcount reduction efforts. Increases within selling, general and administrative expenses aforementioned were partially offset by synergy benefits from the integration of prior acquisitions, cost savings from the planned reduction of our legacy catalog distribution and continued cost control.
Other Highlights
Change in fair value of contingent consideration - recognized $28 million in 2017 due to the final settlement ruling of the contingent consideration liability in connection with the Champion Europe acquisition in 2016.
Other Expenses – lower by $40 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to costs of approximately $47 million associated with the redemption of our 6.375% Senior Notes in 2016, which included a call premium and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. In 2017, we refinanced our senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility) and incurred costs associated with the refinancing of approximately $5 million, which included a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and fees paid to third parties.
Interest Expense – higher by $22 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher debt balances to help fund acquisitions and share repurchases coupled with a higher weighted average interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.78% during 2017, compared to 3.64% during 2016.
Income Tax Expense – income tax expense for 2017 includes a provisional charge related to the Tax Act of $435 million, which includes a $360 million transition tax charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a charge of $72 million for the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% and a $3 million charge related to the deductibility of employee compensation. In addition, we incurred incremental tax costs of approximately $22 million for other impacts of tax reform and other actions taken in 2017.
Discontinued Operations – the results of our discontinued operations include the operations of two businesses, Dunlop Flooring and Tontine Pillow, purchased in the Hanes Australasia acquisition.

Segment operating profit 528,038 563,905 (35,867 ) (6.4 )

Innerwear net sales decreased in both our basics and intimates apparel businesses. Strength in our licensed intimate apparel, sock and men’s underwear businesses, as well as growth in the online channel was more than offset by declines in other product categories due to challenging consumer traffic at retail and cautious inventory management by retailers. Our intimate apparel business also experienced sales declines driven by the continued impact from retail store closures in the mid-tier and department store channel, partially offset by strong performance from our new Maidenform sport and millennial product offerings.
Decreased operating profit was driven largely by lower sales volume coupled with lower margins from unfavorable product mix, as well as expenses related to Project Booster, offset partially by continued cost control.

Segment operating profit 227,589 224,658 2,931 1.3

Activewear net sales increased as a result of our acquisition of Alternative Apparel in October 2017 and expansion into the teamwear and fanware space with the acquisition of GTM in 2016, growth in our core Champion brand in the sports specialty, mid-tier and department store channels, increased licensed sports apparel sales in the college bookstore business, and growth across Activewear product categories online, partially offset by sales declines in Hanes activewear apparel and licensed sports apparel within the mass merchant channel.
Operating profit increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and continued cost control offset, in part, by the impact of retailer bankruptcies and higher proportion of selling, general and administrative expenses at our recently acquired Alternative Apparel and GTM businesses.

Segment operating profit 261,411 179,917 81,494 45.3

Net sales in the International segment were higher as a result of the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Incremental net sales from the acquisitions of Hanes Australasia in July of 2016 and Champion Europe in June of 2016;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continued growth in Asia within our Activewear product category, primarily driven by Champion and Hanes sales growth; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $25 million.

Partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Declining hosiery sales and slower traffic at retail in certain European markets.

Operating profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume, coupled with cost synergies realized in our Hanes Europe Innerwear and Hanes Australasia businesses.

Other net sales were lower as a result of continued declines in hosiery sales in the U.S., slower traffic at our outlet stores and the planned exit from our legacy catalog business in 2016. Operating profit decreased as a result of lower sales volume, offset, in part, by continued cost control.
Corporate
Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action-related costs. Corporate expenses increased in 2017 primarily from higher acquisition, integration and other action-related charges in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets in our recent acquisitions. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges. Business disruption and other actions are mainly expenses associated with natural disasters that impact our business and other action-related costs. Contingent consideration related to Champion Europe represents the charge recognized in relation to the final contingent consideration settlement in excess of amounts previously accrued, as further described in Note, “Acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements. Acquisition-related currency transactions represent the foreign exchange gain from financing activities related to the Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia acquisitions.

Net Sales
Higher net sales primarily due to the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Incremental net sales of approximately $435 million from businesses acquired in 2016, primarily Hanes Australasia and Champion Europe;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Acquisition of Knights Apparel in April 2015, which added an incremental $21 million of net sales in 2016; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continued growth in the Activewear segment within our college bookstore business and Champion sales within the mass merchant channel.

Partially offset by:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower sales in the Innerwear segment due to a slower than expected retail environment;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower net sales in our Activewear segment in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels, primarily due to certain sporting goods retailer bankruptcies; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lower net sales in Other due to slower traffic at our outlet stores, the planned exit of our legacy catalog business and removal of non-core product offerings to a more focused branded store strategy, and continued decline in our Hosiery sales.

Gross Profit
The increase in gross profit was attributable to results obtained from our acquisitions of Hanes Australasia and Champion Europe in 2016, as well as supply chain efficiencies, reduced acquisition, integration, and other action-related costs, and synergies recognized from the integration of our acquisitions, partially offset by costs associated with our inventory reduction related efforts and unfavorable product sales mix within the Activewear segment. Included within gross profit are charges of approximately $39 million and $63 million related to acquisition, integration and other action-related costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.9% in 2016 compared to 26.9% in 2015. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses were charges of approximately $99 million and $203 million of acquisition, integration and other action-related costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, resulted from the decrease in acquisition, integration and other action-related costs, synergy benefits from the integration of prior acquisitions, planned reduction of our catalog distribution and continued cost control, partially offset by higher proportion of selling, general and administrative expenses for acquired entities, primarily Hanes Australasia and Champion Europe.

Table of Contents

Other Highlights
Other Expenses – higher by $49 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to costs associated with the redemption of our 6.375% Senior Notes, which included a call premium and write-off of unamortized costs.
Interest Expense – higher by $35 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher debt balances to help fund acquisitions and share repurchases, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.64% during 2016 compared to 3.75% in 2015.
Income Tax Expense – our effective income tax rate was 6.0% and 9.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries. Income tax expense also benefited from the adoption of accounting rules related to accounting for stock compensation, which required excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income as they occur.
Discontinued Operations – the results of our discontinued operations include the operations of two businesses, Dunlop Flooring and Tontine Pillow, purchased in the Hanes Australasia acquisition.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continued space gains in Asia within our Activewear product category.

Other net sales were lower as a result of slower traffic at our outlet stores, the planned exit from our legacy catalog business and non-core product offerings in our stores and continued decline in our Hosiery sales. Operating profit decreased as a result of lower sales volume, partially offset by a reduction of reserves from the elimination of our customer rewards program and decreased catalog distribution costs.
Corporate
Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action-related charges. Corporate expenses decreased in 2016 primarily from the reduction of acquisition, integration and other action-related charges in 2016 compared to 2015. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses directly related to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, information technology costs and similar charges. Acquisition related currency transactions represent the foreign exchange gain from financing activities related to the Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia acquisitions. Foundational costs are expenses associated with building and realigning our

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from global operations and cash available under our $1.0 billion Revolving Loan Facility, our $275 million Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility and our international loan facilities. As of December 30, 2017, we had $995 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Loan Facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit), $150 million of borrowing availability under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, $166 million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities, which includes our European Revolving Loan Facility, our Australian Revolving Loan Facility and other international notes payable and debt facilities, and $422 million in cash and cash equivalents. We currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with our available credit capacity, will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.
The following have impacted or are expected to impact liquidity:

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• we have principal and interest obligations under our debt;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• we acquired Champion Europe in June 2016, Hanes Australasia in July 2016, Alternative Apparel in October 2017 and we may pursue strategic acquisitions in the future;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• we expect to make required cash contributions of $15 million to our pension plans in 2018;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• we may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we remit to the United States, which could impact our effective income tax rate;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• we are obligated to make installment payments over an eight-year period related to our transition tax liability resulting from the implementation of the Tax Act, beginning in 2018;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• our Board of Directors has authorized a regular quarterly dividend; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares under our share repurchase program. In 2017, we repurchased 19.6 million shares at a cost of $400 million.

We typically use cash during the first half of the year and generate most of our cash flow in the second half of the year. We expect our cash deployment strategy in the future will include a mix of debt prepayments, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.

37

Table of Contents

Cash Requirements for Our Business
We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business, capital expenditures, maturities of debt and related interest payments, business acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans, repurchases of our stock, regular quarterly dividend payments and income tax payments. We believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our foreseeable liquidity needs.
Pension Plans
In 2017, we did not make any voluntary contributions to our pension plan. Our U.S. qualified pension plan was approximately 94% funded as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, under the Pension Protection Act funding rules. Additionally, we expect to make additional required cash contributions of approximately $15 million to our pension plans in 2018 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary. We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions during 2018. See Note, “Defined Pension Benefit Plans,” to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the plan asset and pension expense components.
Income Tax
In 2017, due to existing tax loss and credit carryforwards, we were not required to make any U.S. federal income tax payments. Beginning in 2018, we are obligated to make installment payments over an eight-year period related to our transition tax liability, which totals $149 million, in addition to any estimated income taxes due based on current year taxable income. With the recent enactment of the Tax Act, we are still in the process of analyzing our permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to cash on our consolidated balance sheet that was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were deemed distributed as part of the Tax Act.
Share Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 40 million shares to be repurchased in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. During 2017, we repurchased 19.6 million shares of our common stock under the new program at a cost of $400 million (average price of $20.35). During 2016, we purchased 14.2 million shares of our common stock under a previous program at a cost of $380 million (average price of $26.65). At December 30, 2017, the remaining repurchase authorization under the current share repurchase program totaled approximately 20.4 million shares. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.
The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to utilize excess cash flow to generate shareholder value. While we may repurchase additional stock under the program, we may choose not to repurchase any stock and focus more on other uses of cash in the next 12 months.
Dividends
In 2015, our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends of $0.10 per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2015. On March 3, 2015, we effected a four-for-one stock split in the form of a 300% stock dividend to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2015.
In 2016, our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2016.
In January 2017, our Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend rate to $0.15 per share on outstanding common stock. During our 2017 fiscal year, regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share were paid on March 7, 2017, June 6, 2017, September 6, 2017 and December 5, 2017.
In February 2018, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on outstanding common stock to be paid on March 13, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Operating Activities
Our overall liquidity is primarily driven by our strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net income and changes in working capital. As compared to prior year, our operating cash increased in 2017 due to our strong working capital management, specifically related to increased accounts receivable collections, extension of our accounts payable terms and no voluntary pension contribution in 2017 compared to $40 million in 2016.

Table of Contents

Investing Activities
The lower net cash used by investing activities was primarily the result of decreased acquisition activity in 2017 in comparison to 2016, coupled with cash received in 2017 from our dispositions of the Dunlop Flooring and Tontine Pillow businesses.
Financing Activities
The lower net cash from financing activities was primarily the result of lower net borrowings on our loan facilities in 2017 and the issuance of our three Senior Notes and incurrence of debt under our Australia term loan facilities in 2016 to help fund the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia.
Financing Arrangements
We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies. As of December 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness discussed below. We continue to monitor our covenant compliance carefully in this difficult economic environment. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants during 2018, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under “Risk Factors” could cause noncompliance.
We have significant liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities. We had the following borrowing availability as of December 30, 2017:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements.
The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are described below:
Sales Recognition and Incentives
We recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience.
Note, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” (d), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Sales Recognition and Incentives,” to our consolidated financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these incentives requires, in many cases, estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates. We use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current

incentive programs. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information. We classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of “Net sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounts Receivable Valuation
Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers. We carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers’ financial strength, credit standing and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales” line of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a large reserve might be required. The amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts.
Inventory Valuation
We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, or “FIFO,” method for our inventories. We carry obsolete, damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value, which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.
Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities, as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which these events occur.
We have estimated the impact of the Tax Act incorporating assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the Tax Act. The SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effect of the Tax Act. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and revaluation of our deferred tax assets, and included those amount in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. The actual impact of the Tax Act may differ from our

estimates due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We expect the accounting to be completed within the one year measurement period, as allowed under SAB 118.
Stock Compensation
We established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated) (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to our employees, non-employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees. Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We estimate forfeitures for stock-based awards granted that are not expected to vest. If any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan obligations, plan assets and how we measure the amount of these costs, see Note, “Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” to our consolidated financial statements. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet. Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income. We measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end.
The net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset return. The net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are amortized over the average future expected life of participants. As benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan are frozen, year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to be material and not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In determining the discount rate, we utilized the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median Curve (rounded to the nearest 10 basis points) in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan. Beginning in 2016, we began utilizing a full series specific spot rates along the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median yield curve in our determination of discount rates, for our U.S. defined benefit plans, in order to determine our interest rate and match to the relevant cash flows for the plans. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. The salary increase assumption only applies to the Canadian plans, certain Hanes Europe Innerwear plans and portions of the Hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under these plans are not frozen. The benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan were frozen as of December 31, 2005.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long-term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments, and the utilization of forward-looking assumptions.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality. In 2017, the tables used as a basis for the mortality assumption were from the RP-2014 table with Scale MP-2017.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’ benefit obligations, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles
Trademarks, license agreements, customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. As of December 30, 2017, the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was $1.4 billion, of which we are amortizing a balance of $237 million. We anticipate that our amortization expense for 2018 will be $32 million.
We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under “— Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and more often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Fair values of intangible assets are primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset. We recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill
As of December 30, 2017, we had $1.2 billion of goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur. The timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. The estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in 2017.
In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2017, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units. We relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. As discussed above under “Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles,” there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known.
Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations
We account for business combinations using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of an acquired business’ cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We generally use third party appraisers to assist management in determination of the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles, consulting actuaries to assist management in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assist management in assessing obligations associated with legal and environmental claims.
Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost, and we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates, engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us, which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life. Our policies require that we periodically review our assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods.
We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We evaluate an asset’s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group’s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate. If we determine that an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use, we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change.
