ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and
beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

 Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

 The
following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure.

 Overview

        We are a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than
75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data
communications, and the home.

 Fiscal
2018 highlights included the following:

• Our fiscal 2018 net sales increased 14.8% over fiscal 2017 levels due to growth in all segments. On an organic basis, our net sales increased
9.2% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.

• Our net sales by segment were as follows:

•Transportation Solutions—Our net sales increased 17.8% as a result of
increased sales in all end markets. Also, our net sales in the automotive end market benefited from sales contributions from a recent acquisition.

•Industrial Solutions—Our net sales increased 10.0% due to increased
sales in the industrial equipment end market and, to a lesser degree, the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the energy end markets.

•Communications Solutions—Our net sales increased 12.4% due to sales
increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets.

• During fiscal 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly
installments of $0.44 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

• Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,301 million in fiscal 2018.

Outlook

        In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect our net sales to be between $3.33 billion and $3.43 billion as compared to
$3.34 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with sales increases in the Industrial Solutions and Communications Solutions segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our
reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018 is as follows:

•Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales increase in the sensors end market
to be offset by sales declines in the automotive end market. Our net sales in the automotive end market are

Table of Contents

expected
to benefit from content gains; however, this growth will be more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We expect global automotive production to decline
approximately 2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

•Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales growth to be driven primarily by
increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the industrial equipment end markets.

•Communications Solutions—We expect net sales growth primarily as a result of
increased sales in the data and devices end market.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.13 per share. This outlook reflects the negative impact of
foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $75 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same
period of fiscal 2018.

 We
expect our net sales to be between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to $14.0 billion in fiscal 2018, with moderate growth in all
segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is as follows:

•Transportation Solutions—We expect our net sales increases in the sensors end
market to be largely offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market. Fiscal 2019 global automotive production is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2018 levels.

•Industrial Solutions—We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial
equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in medical applications and a recent acquisition.

•Communications Solutions—We expect net sales growth due primarily to sales
increases in the data and devices end market.

We
expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share in fiscal 2019. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange
rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

 The
above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.

 We
are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with
economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further
discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Acquisitions

        During fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions
were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.

 We
acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our
Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

 In
fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including the Creganna Medical group ("Creganna"), for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The
acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

Discontinued Operations

 On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for
$325 million, subject to a final working capital adjustment. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods
presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.

 See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Divestiture

        During fiscal 2016, we sold our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a
pre-tax gain of $144 million on the transaction. The CPD business was reported as part of the Data and Devices business within our Communications Solutions segment.

 Net
sales increased $1,803 million, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 9.2%, the positive
impact of foreign currency translation of 3.6% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%. Organic net sales were adversely affected by
price erosion of $180 million in fiscal 2018.

Table of Contents

        Net sales increased $833 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of
6.1% and net sales contributions from acquisitions and a divestiture of 1.9%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.7% due to the weakening of certain foreign
currencies. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $218 million in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $227 million in net
sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year.

 See
further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."

         Net Sales by Geographic Region.    Our business operates in three geographic regions—EMEA, Asia–Pacific, and the
Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies,
will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our
products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 by
major currencies invoiced was as follows:

Gross margin $ 4,745 $ 4,183 $ 3,827 (1) $ 562 $ 356
As a percentage of net sales 33.9 % 34.3 % 33.7 %

(1)Fiscal
2016 included an additional week which contributed $86 million in gross margin.

 In
fiscal 2018, gross margin increased $562 million as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of higher volume and the positive impact of foreign currency translation,
partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.9% in fiscal 2018 from 34.3% in fiscal 2017. Gross margin increased $356 million in fiscal 2017 as
compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to higher volume and lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.3% in fiscal 2017 from
33.7% in fiscal 2016.

 Cost
of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. In
fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 195 million pounds of copper, 139,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.8 million troy ounces of silver. The following table presents the average prices
incurred related to copper, gold, and silver.

------ -------- ------ ----- ---- - ----- - -----

Gold Troy oz. 1,281 1,229 1,212
Silver Troy oz. 17.15 16.75 16.08

 In
fiscal 2019, we expect to purchase approximately 210 million pounds of copper, 140,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.8 million troy ounces of silver.

Research, development, and engineering expenses $ 680 $ 611 $ 603 $ 69 $ 8
Restructuring and other charges (credits), net 126 147 (2 ) (21 ) 149

         Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    In fiscal 2018, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased
$51 million as compared
to fiscal 2017 due primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and incremental expenses attributable to recently acquired businesses,

Table of Contents

partially
offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain assets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $147 million in fiscal 2017 as compared
to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation costs, increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, and increased costs associated with long-term expense
reduction initiatives.

        Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses.    In fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased
$69 million as
compared to fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.

         Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits), Net.    We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate
opportunities to simplify
our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness
in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.

 During
fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and
Transportation Solutions segments. During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting
all segments. During fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment.

 In
connection with these initiatives, we recorded net restructuring charges of $140 million, $146 million, and $121 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $125 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2020. Cost
savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2019, we expect net restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal 2018 levels and
we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $140 million.

 During
fiscal 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of our CPD business.

 See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges (credits).

         Other Income (Expense), Net.    In fiscal 2016, we recorded net other expense primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with
Tyco
International plc ("Tyco International") and Covidien plc ("Covidien"). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding net other income
(expense).

        Income Taxes.    See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding items impacting income tax
expense (benefit) and
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 and information regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). We do not expect a significant change in our effective tax rate on future
results of operations as a result of the Act.

 The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $2,191 million and $3,627 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

 As
of fiscal year end 2018, certain subsidiaries had approximately $23 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our
global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.

         Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes.    On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive
agreement to sell our
SubCom business. The net sales of the business were $702 million, $928 million, $886 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, net sales and operating
income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. In fiscal 2017, net sales increased as a result of higher project activity and operating income was positively impacted by lower
material costs and improved manufacturing productivity as compared to fiscal 2016.

Table of Contents

        In connection with the sale of the SubCom business, in fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which is included in income
(loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We expect to incur a
pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $90 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses and certain guarantee liabilities, which will be presented in
income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In November 2018, we completed the sale of the SubCom business for $325 million. The proceeds received
are subject to a final working capital adjustment.

 During
fiscal 2016, we settled a lawsuit with the former shareholders of Com-Net, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million representing a
release of excess reserves. This amount was reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former
Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009. Also during fiscal 2016, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the fiscal 2015 divestiture of our Broadband Network
Solutions ("BNS") business, related primarily to pension and net working capital adjustments.

 See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

•Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 8.2% in fiscal 2018 with growth of 16.0%
in the Americas region, 8.3% in the EMEA region, and 5.0% in the Asia–Pacific region. Our growth in the Americas region resulted from electronification and market share gains in North
America and market growth in South America. In the EMEA region, our growth was driven by market growth, electronification, and market share gains. Our growth in the Asia–Pacific region was
driven by market share gains and electronification.

•Commercial transportation—Our organic net sales increased 23.2% in fiscal 2018 with
growth in all regions due primarily to strength in the heavy truck, construction, and agriculture markets.

•Sensors—Our organic net sales increased 8.9% in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result
of growth in the commercial transportation, industrial equipment, and automotive markets.

 Net
sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $536 million, or 8.2%, in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of organic net sales growth of 8.5%.
Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $130 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as
follows:

•Automotive—Our organic net sales increased 7.1% in fiscal 2017. The increase
resulted from growth of 11.1% in the Asia–Pacific region, 5.6% in the EMEA region, and 1.4% in the Americas region. Our growth in the Asia–Pacific region was driven by
increased demand in China resulting from a tax incentive program, market share gains, and increased electronification. In the EMEA region, our organic net sales growth was driven by market growth,
electronification, and new model launches. Our growth in the Americas region resulted from continued market recovery in South America.

•Commercial transportation—Our organic net sales increased 21.9% in fiscal 2017
primarily as a result of growth in the heavy truck market in all regions and content gains in China.

•Sensors—Our organic net sales increased 3.0% in fiscal 2017 due primarily to growth
in the industrial equipment and commercial transportation markets, partially offset by declines in the data and devices market.

 In
fiscal 2018, net sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $203 million, or 12.4%, as compared to fiscal 2017 due to organic net sales growth of 10.5% and the
positive impact of foreign currency translation of 1.9%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•Data and devices—Our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2018 as a result of
growth in all regions, primarily attributable to growth in high speed connectivity in data center applications.

•Appliances—Our organic net sales increased 12.0% in fiscal 2018 as a result of
growth in all regions and market share gains.

 Net
sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Organic net sales growth of 5.7% was largely offset by sales
declines resulting from a divestiture of 4.3% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 1.1%. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $32 million in net
sales. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows:

•Data and devices—Our organic net sales increased 2.3% in fiscal 2017 primarily as a
result of increased sales to cloud infrastructure customers, partially offset by sales declines resulting from weakness in the wireless market.

•Appliances—Our organic net sales increased 10.8% in fiscal 2017 due primarily to

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by
our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing
arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the
foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes and $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in fiscal 2019. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion
of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt.
The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.

 As
of fiscal year end 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws,
substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE
Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial
Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global
manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we had approximately $11.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the
ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to $0.9 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the
Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and
intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

        Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $28 million to $2,301 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to
$2,273 million in fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, substantially offset by the impact of higher working capital to support increased business
levels and increased incentive compensation payments.

 Net
cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $340 million to $2,273 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to $1,933 million in fiscal 2016. The
increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related primarily to incentive
compensation, and a decrease in net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, partially offset by the impact of increased sales on accounts receivable levels.

 The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $393 million, $323 million, and $806 million, respectively. In fiscal 2017
and 2016, these amounts included refunds of $23 million and payments of $471 million, respectively, related to pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2016, we received net
reimbursements of $321 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. We do not expect a significant change in our income tax
payments as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

 See
Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement and payments related to pre-separation tax matters.

 Pension
contributions in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $54 million, $48 million, and $67 million, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be
$47 million in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

        Capital expenditures were $935 million, $679 million, and $603 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Capital spending increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased investments in growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment. We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels
to be approximately 5-6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance
productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

 During
fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a
combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including Creganna, for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion,
net of cash acquired. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

 During
fiscal 2016, we received net cash proceeds of $333 million related to the sale of our CPD business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization

        Total debt at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017 was $4,000 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

 TEGSA,
our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of
$1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2018 or 2017.

 The
Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit

37

Table of Contents

Facility)
for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility
and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we were in compliance with
all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.

 Periodically,
TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are backed by the Credit Facility.

 TEGSA's
payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

 Payments
of common share dividends to shareholders were $588 million, $546 million, and $509 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See Note 18
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares.

 Future
dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our
board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors
that they may deem relevant.

 During
fiscal 2018 and 2016, our board of directors authorized increases of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in the share repurchase program. We repurchased
approximately 10 million of our common shares for $966 million, 8 million of our common shares for $621 million, and 43 million of our common shares for
$2,610 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. At fiscal year end 2018, we had $1.0 billion of availability remaining under our share
repurchase authorization.

of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties.

(5)The
above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however,
we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts
of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $47 million to pension plans in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments.

(6)Other
long-term liabilities of $487 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.

Legal Proceedings

        In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product
liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value
added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable
law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance,
and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks
involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities
and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 At
fiscal year end 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $275 million.

 As
discussed above, in September 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SubCom business. Following the divestiture, we will continue to honor performance guarantees and
letters of credit related to the SubCom business' existing projects. These existing guarantees have a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates
through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new
performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. We have contractual recourse against the
SubCom business if we are required to perform on these guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to

perform.
See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that
involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Revenue Recognition

 Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, Revenue
Recognition. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of
our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping
point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is
recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical
experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales.

 Contract
revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the SubCom business which is reported in discontinued operations, are recorded primarily using the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the
ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for
anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are
recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable.

 See
Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the SubCom business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for information regarding our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in fiscal 2019.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

 Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets
with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to
50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when
events and circumstances warrant.

 We
test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a "component") if the component
constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2018, we had five reporting units, all of which contained
goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in
the

40

Table of Contents

composition
of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our
annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.

 Goodwill
impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we
believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors
including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.

 When
testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In
the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is
recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

 Fair
value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The
income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and
market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future
periods.

 We
completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and determined that no impairment existed.

Income Taxes

 In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the
calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial
statement recognition of revenue and expense.

 In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax
jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

 We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in
the appropriate

41

Table of Contents

jurisdictions.
Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An
increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

 Changes
in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we
conduct our operations. Under
the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions
based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax
loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax
authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Pension Liabilities

 Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit
obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the
current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

 Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected
average remaining service lives of current participants.

 Two
critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least
annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience.
Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected
future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2018, a 25
basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $124 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of
our pension obligations by $111 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types
of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or
decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2018 pension expense by $12 million.

42

Table of Contents

 At
fiscal year end 2018, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% return-seeking assets and 90% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet
that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 105%. Based on the funded status of
the plans as of fiscal year end 2018, our target asset allocation is 45% return-seeking and 55% liability-hedging.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Organic Net Sales Growth

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to
results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and
acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely
under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture
activity.

 Organic
net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also,
management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also
a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The
tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 Organic
net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be
comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or
decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact
of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

agreement to sell our
SubCom business. The net sales of the business were $702 million, $928 million, $886 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, net sales and operating
income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. In fiscal 2017, net sales increased as a result of higher project activity and operating income was positively impacted by lower
material costs and improved manufacturing productivity as compared to fiscal 2016.

        In connection with the sale of the SubCom business, in fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which is included in income
(loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We expect to incur a
pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $90 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses and certain guarantee liabilities, which will be presented in
income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In November 2018, we completed the sale of the SubCom business for $325 million. The proceeds received
are subject to a final working capital adjustment.

 During
fiscal 2016, we settled a lawsuit with the former shareholders of Com-Net, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million representing a

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that
involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management']:

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Organic Net Sales Growth

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to
results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and
acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely
