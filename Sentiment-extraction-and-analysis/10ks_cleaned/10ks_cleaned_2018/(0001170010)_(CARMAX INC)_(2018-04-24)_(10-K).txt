Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.  All references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share.  Amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding.
OVERVIEW
See Part I, Item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business.

CarMax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles.  We operate in two reportable segments:  CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”).  Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF.  Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.
CarMax Sales Operations
Our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services, such as wholesale vehicle sales; the sale of extended protection plan (“EPP”) products, which include extended service plans (“ESPs”) and guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”); and vehicle repair service. We offer low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles; value-added EPP products; and superior customer service. Our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the CarMax consumer offer in detail; sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle; and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online.
Our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us, and availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the sales process.  We provide financing to qualified retail customers through CAF and our arrangements with industry-leading third-party finance providers.  All of the finance offers, whether by CAF or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option.
As of February 28, 2018, we operated 188 used car stores in 91 U.S. television markets. As of that date, we also conducted wholesale auctions at 73 used car stores and we operated 2 new car franchises.
CarMax Auto Finance
In addition to third-party finance providers, we provide vehicle financing through CAF, which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.  CAF allows us to manage our reliance on third-party finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option.  As a result, we believe CAF enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales.  CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 43.1% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2018.  As of February 28, 2018, CAF serviced approximately 895,000 customer accounts in its $11.62 billion portfolio of managed receivables.
Management regularly analyzes CAF’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables, including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and CAF direct expenses.
Revenues and Profitability
During fiscal 2018, net sales and operating revenues increased 7.8% and net earnings increased 5.9%. The 10.4% increase in earnings per share reflected the increase in net earnings and the effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. Net earnings was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“2017 Tax Act”).
Our primary source of revenue and net earnings is the retail sale of used vehicles.  During fiscal 2018, we sold 721,512 used cars, representing 84.1% of our net sales and operating revenues and 67.3% of our gross profit.  Used vehicle revenues grew 8.5% and used vehicle gross profits improved 8.0%, primarily due to a 7.5% increase in total used unit sales, which included a 2.0% increase in comparable store used units.
Wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net earnings.  During fiscal 2018, we sold 408,509 wholesale vehicles, representing 12.7% of our net sales and operating revenues and 16.9% of our gross profit.  Wholesale vehicle revenues

22

grew 4.7% and wholesale vehicle gross profits improved 8.2% due to the combination of a 4.3% increase in unit sales and a 3.8% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit.
During fiscal 2018, other sales and revenues, which include revenue earned on the sale of EPP products, net third-party finance fees, and service department and new car sales, represented 3.2% of our net sales and operating revenues and 15.8% of our gross profit.  Other sales and revenues increased 4.7% primarily reflecting improvements in EPP revenues, partially offset by a decline in net third-party finance fees. Other gross profit remained consistent with the prior year, as decreases in service profits and net third-party finance fees were largely offset by the increase in EPP revenues.
Income from our CAF segment totaled $421.2 million in fiscal 2018, up 14.1% compared with fiscal 2017.  The increase in CAF income was primarily due to an increase in average managed receivables and a decline in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage.
During fiscal 2018, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 8.6% to $1.62 billion, primarily reflecting the 9% increase in our store base since the beginning of fiscal 2018, as well as an increase in the accrual for corporate incentive pay and spending on strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation.
The effective income tax rate was 37.6% in fiscal 2018 compared with 37.7% in fiscal 2017. The current year’s effective tax rate was affected by an $11.9 million increase in tax expense as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, including:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The $32.7 million increase in tax expense associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset, which increased our effective tax rate by 3.1 percentage points.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The $20.8 million decrease in tax expense primarily resulting from the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate, effective January 1, 2018, which reduced our effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points.

Liquidity
Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.  During fiscal 2018, net cash used in operations totaled $80.6 million. This amount, combined with $902.2 million of net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, resulted in $821.6 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, a non-GAAP measure. This liquidity, together with borrowing under our revolving credit facility, was primarily used to fund the 8.9 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and our store growth.
When considering cash provided by operating activities, management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. For a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see “Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Cash from Operating Activities” included in “FINANCIAL CONDITION – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Future Outlook
Our long-term strategy is to complete the rollout of our retail concept and to increase our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate. We believe that, over the long term, used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth. We also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased CAF income.
As of February 28, 2018, we had used car stores located in 91 television markets, which covered approximately 73% of the U.S. population.  Completing our rollout requires a disciplined approach to opening stores in new markets and expanding our presence in existing markets. The format and operating models utilized in stores are continuously evaluated and may change or evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations. We opened 15 stores in fiscal 2018 and plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2019 and between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020. For a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019, see the table included in “PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES.”
In calendar 2017, we estimate we sold approximately 4.6% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold in the television markets in which we operate. Our strategy to increase our share of each of these markets includes focusing on:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Delivering an unrivaled customer experience both in stores and online.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Connecting the digital and physical customer experiences to enhance the car buying and selling process.

- -------------------------------------------------------
• Hiring and developing an engaged and skilled workforce.

- ----------------------------------------
• Improving efficiency to drive out waste.

23

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Leveraging data and advanced analytics to continuously improve our processes and systems.

We are investing in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation, specifically with regards to customer facing and customer enabling technologies. We have implemented new enterprise-wide customer relationship management and mobile appraisal technologies. We also continue to invest in search engine optimization and enhance our online financing and online appraisal processes. Our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data in new ways to enhance customer experience and increase operational efficiencies.

While we execute our long-term strategy, there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term. A significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local, regional and online wholesale auto auctions. Wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand. Industry sources predict that there will be a continued influx in off-lease vehicles in coming years, which has and could continue to increase the volume of late-model vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand. While conditions in any one quarter may vary, this has and could continue to reduce wholesale auction prices and our vehicle acquisition costs. It could also impact CAF recovery rates.

The federal statutory tax rate associated with the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted in our fourth quarter, is expected to result in future benefits to our financial results and cash flows. While the exact amount of those future benefits has not yet been determined, we currently intend to use those benefits to invest in our associates and business, including our digital and technology capabilities. We expect that, after these investments, 70% to 85% of the benefit from the lower tax rate will impact our net earnings. While in any individual period conditions may vary, over the long term we would expect to begin leveraging our SG&A expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the mid-single digit range. In the near term, while we are investing more heavily in strategic initiatives, we believe the SG&A leverage point is likely at the higher end of this range.

For additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company, see “Risk Factors,” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions.  We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions.  Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies.  The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment.  Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed.
Financing and Securitization Transactions
We maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities (“warehouse facilities”) that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by CAF. We typically elect to fund these receivables through an asset-backed term funding transaction, such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement, at a later date.  We recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and asset-backed term funding transactions, including term securitizations (together, “non-recourse funding vehicles”), as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets.  CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses.
See Notes 2(F), 2(H) and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date. Such losses are expected to become evident during the following 12 months.  Because net loss performance can vary substantially over time, estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain.
The allowance for loan losses is estimated using a combination of analytical models and management judgment. These models are primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables (including month of origination and actual prior performance of the receivables), historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves.  For receivables that have less than 12 months of performance history, the estimate also takes into account the credit grades of the receivables and historical losses by

24

credit grade to supplement actual loss data in estimating future performance. Once the receivables have 12 months of performance history, the estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance. The forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life.
Estimates from these models rely on historical performance information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio. Therefore, management also considers recent trends in delinquencies and defaults, recovery rates and the economic environment in assessing the models used in estimating the allowance for loan losses, and may adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect factors that may not be captured in the models.  In addition, management periodically considers whether the use of additional metrics would result in improved model performance and revises the models when appropriate.
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and, therefore, net earnings. To the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings. A 10% change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately $12.9 million as of February 28, 2018.

See Notes 2(H) and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer.  As part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5‑day, money-back guarantee.  We record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages.
We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a retail vehicle. The ESPs we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract.  We recognize revenue, on a net basis, at the time of sale. We also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations.  Periodically, we may receive retrospective commissions based upon the performance of the policies administered by the third parties.  These additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received.  The reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base.  Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.  Cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of EPP sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product.  Results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. A 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $10.5 million as of February 28, 2018.  See Note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves.
Customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by CAF are generally evaluated by other third-party finance providers.  These providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract.  We recognize these fees at the time of sale.
We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale.  These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales.

Used car stores, beginning of year 173 158 144
Store openings 15 15 14
Used car stores, end of year 188 173 158

During fiscal 2018, we opened 15 stores, including 7 stores in 5 new television markets (3 stores in Seattle, WA, and 1 store each in Salisbury, MD; Tyler, TX; Myrtle Beach, SC; and Portland, ME) and 8 stores in 7 existing television markets (1 store each in Pensacola, FL; Hartford, CT; Philadelphia, PA; Las Vegas, NV; Boston, MA; and Denver, CO; and 2 stores in San Francisco, CA).

Used Vehicle Sales
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.5% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a 7.5% increase in unit sales. The increase in used unit sales included a 2.0% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by a continued strong conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic. We believe that strong execution in our stores as well as the impact of our digital initiatives contributed to our continued improvements in conversion. Our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by almost 7% in calendar 2017.
Average retail selling price for fiscal 2018 remained relatively consistent with the prior year, reflecting the net effects of shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class and lower vehicle acquisition costs. Decreases in vehicle acquisition costs in the first half of the year were largely offset by increases in the second half of the year. We believe lower seasonal depreciation was a significant driver of the increase in vehicle acquisition costs in the second half of the year. At the same time, industry new vehicle transaction prices benefited from aggressive new car incentives. We believe the resulting change in the relative affordability of new vehicles versus late-model vehicles was one of the factors contributing to our comparable store used unit sales performance.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 6.7% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from an 8.3% increase in unit sales combined with a 1.7% decline in average retail selling price.  The increase in used unit sales included a 4.3% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit sales performance resulted from an increase in conversion, partially offset by a slight decline in store traffic.
We believe the decline in store traffic was predominantly the result of a decline in customers typically financed by Tier 3 providers. The decline in Tier 3 sales was the result of tightened lending standards by one of our third-party Tier 3 finance providers that we experienced starting in the middle of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and lower applicant volume within this credit tier. Our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 2% in calendar 2016.

27

The decline in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of lower vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class. We believe the increased supply of late-model vehicles available at auction contributed to the lower acquisition costs, which, in turn, helped to increase the value proposition of late-model used vehicles relative to new cars.

Wholesale Vehicle Sales
Vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are, on average, approximately 10 years old with more than 100,000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 4.7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 resulted from a 4.3% increase in wholesale unit sales. During fiscal 2018, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to an increase in our appraisal buy rate and growth in our store base were partially offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. We believe the appraisal buy rate benefited from strong wholesale industry vehicle valuations, which allowed us to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers. Wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2018 remained consistent with the prior year.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 4.8% decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from a 4.1% decrease in wholesale vehicle average selling prices and a 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales. During fiscal 2017, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to the growth in our store base and an improved appraisal buy rate were more than offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. In particular, we experienced a reduced mix of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix, which we believe resulted, at least in part, from the reduced overall industry supply of these model year vehicles due to the decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession. This shift in mix also contributed to the decline in average selling price.
Other Sales and Revenues
Other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of ESPs and GAP (collectively reported in EPP revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), net third-party finance fees, and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales. The fees we pay to the Tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the Tier 2 providers. The mix of our retail vehicles financed by CAF, Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers, or customers that arrange their own financing, may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants, changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions. Changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Other sales and revenues increased 4.7% in fiscal 2018. EPP revenues increased 10.1% compared with the prior year, largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales. The $11.5 million reduction in net third-party finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel, including a decline in our Tier 2 and an increase in our Tier 3 sales.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Other sales and revenues remained consistent in fiscal 2017, as changes in the underlying components offset one another. New vehicle sales declined due to the disposal of two of our four new car franchises during fiscal 2016. EPP revenues increased 14.1% largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales and pricing changes. Net third-party finance fees improved by 37.6% primarily due to the reduced proportion of our used unit sales financed by Tier 3 finance providers.

Used Vehicle Gross Profit
We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold.  The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price.  Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit.
We systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement.  Other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments, vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs, and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process.  Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.0% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the 7.5% growth in total used unit sales. Despite an overall trend reported by publicly traded auto retailers in recent quarters towards lower gross profit per unit sold, our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2017. We believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range, subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 8.4% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the 8.3% growth in total used unit sales. Our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2016.

Our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.  The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles.  Our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.2% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 was driven by the 4.3% increase in wholesale unit sales and the $35, or 3.8%, increase in wholesale gross profit per unit. We believe our wholesale gross profit per unit benefited from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 6.6% decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 reflected the combination of the 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales and a $58, or 5.9%, reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit. The decline in gross profit per unit was due in part to the reduced proportion of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix. In addition, compared with fiscal 2016, differences in the rate of depreciation relative to changes in our appraisal offers contributed to the decline in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit.
Other Gross Profit
Other gross profit includes profits related to EPP revenues, net third-party finance fees and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning, and new vehicle sales.  We have no cost of sales related to EPP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent revenues paid to us by certain third-party providers. Third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party Tier 3 finance providers.  Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit.

29

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Other gross profit remained consistent in fiscal 2018, as a $19.2 million decrease in service profits and the decrease in net third-party finance fees discussed above were largely offset by the noted increase in EPP revenues. Service profits were affected by the reduced leverage of service department costs resulting from our more modest comparable store used unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Other gross profit rose 26.3% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the improvement in EPP revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above. The decrease in new vehicle sales did not significantly affect other gross profit.
Impact of Inflation
Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results.  Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices.  However, changes in average vehicle selling prices impact CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also changes.

(3) Calculated as total SG&A expenses divided by total used vehicle units.

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  SG&A expenses for fiscal 2018 increased 8.6%. The increase primarily reflected the 9% growth in our store base during fiscal 2018 (representing the addition of 15 stores); an $18.0 million increase in the corporate incentive pay accrual; and higher variable costs associated with our comparable store unit growth. These increases were partially offset by a $27.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, which reduced SG&A per used unit by $47. The decrease in share-based compensation expense reflected higher costs incurred in fiscal 2017 in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer, as well as a decrease in the expense related to cash-settled restricted stock units in fiscal 2018. The expense associated with these units was primarily driven by the change in the company’s stock price during the fiscal year. The $19.3 million, or 8.1%, increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  SG&A expenses for fiscal 2017 increased 10.1%. The increase primarily reflected the 9% growth in our store base during fiscal 2017 (representing the addition of 15 stores), and a $35.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense. The increase in share-based compensation expense increased SG&A per used unit by $47 and was largely related to cash-settled restricted stock units, which are awards provided broadly to non-executive associates in our organization. The fiscal 2017 share-based compensation expense included approximately $10 million of incremental expense related to awards granted or modified by the board of directors to our former chief executive officer. The $41.5 million, or 20.9%, increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives.

Interest Expense
Interest expense includes the interest related to short- and long-term debt and finance and capital lease obligations. It does not include interest on the non-recourse notes payable, which is reflected within CAF income.

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Interest expense increased to $70.7 million in fiscal 2018 versus $56.4 million in fiscal 2017. The increase reflected the combined effects of higher outstanding debt levels and interest rates in fiscal 2018 as well as a reduction in capitalized interest.

30

Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Interest expense increased to $56.4 million in fiscal 2017 versus $36.4 million in fiscal 2016. The increase reflected the combination of planned higher outstanding debt levels in fiscal 2017 as part of our capital structure strategy, as well as growth in our finance and capital lease obligations. During fiscal 2017, we sold $500 million of senior unsecured notes, due in 2023, 2026 and 2028, to investors in a private placement.
Other Expense
During fiscal 2016, we recorded a one-time charge of $8.3 million associated with a property that was no longer planned to be used.

Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 37.6% in fiscal 2018, 37.7% in fiscal 2017 and 38.3% in fiscal 2016. The 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The provision with the most significant impact to CarMax was the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.

The 2017 Tax Act increased our fiscal 2018 income tax expense by $11.9 million, which was made up of the following:

• We revalued our net deferred tax asset based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse in the future. As a result, we recognized a provisional $32.7 million of tax expense related to this revaluation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax expense decreased by $20.8 million, primarily resulting from the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 32.7% for fiscal 2018, which reflects the blended federal statutory rate.

These combined effects resulted in a net impact to our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate of 1.1 percentage points. In future quarters, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will generally be around 25%. This rate is subject to volatility associated with the adoption in fiscal 2018 of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2016-09 regarding share-based compensation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CARMAX AUTO FINANCE

CAF income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by CAF’s portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs.  Although CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to CAF to avoid making subjective allocation decisions.  Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses.

CAF’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years.  Trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. We strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will, in the aggregate and excluding CAF’s Tier 3 originations, result in cumulative net losses in the 2% to 2.5% range over the life of the loans.  Actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors, including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations, economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates.  Current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the CAF business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores.   Because we recognize CAF income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results.

See Note 3 for additional information on CAF income and Note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality.

(2) The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. While in any individual period conditions may vary, over the past 10 fiscal years, the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 44% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment.

32

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  CAF income increased 14.1% in fiscal 2018, which was due to an increase in the average managed receivables and a decline in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage. Average managed receivables grew 10.4% to $11.21 billion in fiscal 2018 driven primarily by the rise in CAF loan originations in recent years. The growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2018 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in average amount financed, partially offset by a decrease in CAF's penetration rate.
The provision for loan losses declined to $137.6 million in fiscal 2018 from $150.6 million in fiscal 2017. The prior year’s provision was affected by rising loss experience, while losses were generally consistent with expectations in fiscal 2018. As a result, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 1.11% as of February 28, 2018 compared with 1.16% as of February 28, 2017. Changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months.
The total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, declined to 5.7% of average managed receivables from 5.8% in fiscal 2017. This was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years. Changes in the interest margin on new originations affect CAF income over time. Continued increases in interest rates, which affect CAF’s funding costs, or other competitive pressures on consumer rates, could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  CAF income declined 5.9% in fiscal 2017. The decline was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and lower total interest margin percentage, partially offset by the increase in average managed receivables. Average managed receivables grew 11.7% to $10.16 billion in fiscal 2017 driven by the rise in CAF loan originations in recent years. The growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2017 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in CAF's penetration rate that was caused by an increased mix of credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum.

The total interest margin declined to 5.8% of average managed receivables from 6.1% in fiscal 2016.  This was due to the same reasons noted above in the fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017 comparison.
The provision for loan losses rose to $150.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $101.2 million in fiscal 2016 due to unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017 as well as the growth in managed receivables. While higher loss rates were primarily due to an increase in charge-offs, lower recovery rates also contributed to the unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017, which we believe reflected conditions impacting our industry as a whole.
Tier 3 Loan Originations.  CAF also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our Tier 3 finance providers, in order to better understand the performance of these loans, mitigate risk and add incremental profits.  CAF currently targets originating approximately 5% of the total Tier 3 loan volume; however, this rate may vary over time based on market conditions. A total of $147.5 million and $123.3 million in CAF Tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the CAF portfolio, as well as higher contract rates.  As of February 28, 2018 and 2017, approximately 10% of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding CAF Tier 3 loan balances.

PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES

We currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2019 and between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we will be entering nine new television markets and expanding our presence in six existing television markets. Of the 15 stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019, 10 are in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”) having populations of 600,000 or less, which we define as small markets. We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $340 million in fiscal 2019.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2(X) to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement and CAF. Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.

We currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35% to 45%. In calculating this ratio, we utilize total debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity. We expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to maintain this targeted ratio; however, in any period, we may be outside this range due to seasonal, market, strategic or other factors.

Operating Activities.  During fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities totaled $80.6 million compared with $455.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $116.8 million in fiscal 2016. The net cash used in operating activities includes increases in auto loan receivables of $1.08 billion in fiscal 2018, $1.21 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016.  The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities.

34

As of February 28, 2018, total inventory was $2.39 billion, representing an increase of $130.1 million, or 5.8%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. The increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2018 as well as an increase in acquisition costs resulting from higher wholesale valuations, especially in the months following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

As of February 28, 2017, total inventory was $2.26 billion, representing an increase of $328.5 million, or 17.0%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year.  The increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017. Increased inventory levels were also a result of changes in the timing in federal income tax refunds that impacted the timing of anticipated sales in February 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in acquisition costs.

When considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable.  This is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the year.  The resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations.  Including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows:

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities $ 821.6 $ 759.4 $ 940.3

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) In connection with our adoption of FASB ASU 2016-09 during the current fiscal year, cash flows related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements are now classified as operating activities, rather than financing activities, in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Calculated using the gross issuances less payments on non-recourse notes payable as disclosed on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Compared with fiscal 2017, the increase in fiscal 2018 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory during fiscal 2018 and the increase in net earnings when excluding non-cash expenses, which include depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves and the deferred income tax provision. These increases were partially offset by the timing and use of non-recourse funding vehicles in relation to originations of auto loan receivables.

Compared with fiscal 2016, the decrease in fiscal 2017 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory, partially offset by the timing of payments related to operating payables and an increase in net earnings when excluding non-cash expenses. In addition, the increase in net issuances of non-recourse notes payable was primarily attributable to loan origination growth, as well as the new warehouse facility being used to fund certain of CAF’s Tier 3 loans. In fiscal 2016, all of CAF's Tier 3 loans were funded through the use of existing working capital.

Investing Activities.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $326.8 million in fiscal 2018, $465.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $378.8 million in fiscal 2016.  Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $296.8 million in fiscal 2018, $418.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $315.6 million in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs, real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses.  We maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years.  We opened 15 stores in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, and we opened 14 stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 largely reflected reduced spending on construction and land acquisitions resulting from changes in the mix of markets in which stores were being built.

Financing Activities.  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $413.4 million in fiscal 2018, $921.9 million in fiscal 2017 and $505.3 million in fiscal 2016.  Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $902.2 million, $1.21 billion and $1.06 billion, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.08 billion, $1.21 billion and $1.20 billion, respectively, in auto loan receivables (see Operating Activities).  During

35

fiscal 2018, we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by $42.6 million. During fiscal 2017, we sold $500 million of senior unsecured notes in a private placement, and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2016, we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by $404.6 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $579.6 million in fiscal 2018, $564.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $983.9 million in fiscal 2016.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Total debt excludes unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note 11 for additional information.

We have a $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2020.  Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us.  We also have a $300 million unsecured variable-rate term loan, which is due in August 2020.  In addition, we have $500 million of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, which are due in 2023, 2026 and 2028. The credit facility, term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions and covenants.  If these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity.

Finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to sale-leaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and, therefore, are accounted for as financings. Payments on the leases are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations. In the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term, the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments, with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions. Upon modification, the amortization of the obligation is reset, resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification.
See Note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility, term loan, senior notes and finance and capital lease obligations.
CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and asset-backed term funding transactions.  These non-recourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our non-recourse funding vehicles, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings.  Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables.  We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these non-recourse funding vehicles.
The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto loan receivables. The current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period.
As of February 28, 2018, $9.81 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to asset-backed term funding transactions.  These notes payable have scheduled maturities through July 2024, but they may mature earlier, depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables.  During fiscal 2018, we funded a total of $5.25 billion in asset-backed term funding transactions.
As of February 28, 2018, $1.83 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities.  We have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time, as our store base, sales and CAF loan originations have grown.  In fiscal 2018, we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by $340 million. As of February 28, 2018, the combined warehouse facility limit was $3.14 billion, and the unused warehouse capacity totaled $1.31 billion.  Of the combined warehouse

36

facility limit, $1.30 billion will expire in August 2018, $140.0 million will expire in September 2018 and $1.70 billion will expire in February 2019.  See Notes 2(F) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities.
The agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers.  If these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities.  In addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer.  Further, we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents.
We expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations, borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures, repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future.  We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing, funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs.  However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements.
The timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors.  Shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  As of February 28, 2018, a total of $2.75 billion of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding, with no expiration date.  At that date, $1.02 billion remained available for repurchase. See Note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity.
Fair Value Measurements.  We recognize money market securities, mutual fund investments and derivative instruments at fair value.  See Note 6 for more information on fair value measurements.

Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments.

During fiscal 2018, we opened 15 stores, including 7 stores in 5 new television markets (3 stores in Seattle, WA, and 1 store each in Salisbury, MD; Tyler, TX; Myrtle Beach, SC; and Portland, ME) and 8 stores in 7 existing television markets (1 store each in Pensacola, FL; Hartford, CT; Philadelphia, PA; Las Vegas, NV; Boston, MA; and Denver, CO; and 2 stores in San Francisco, CA).

Used Vehicle Sales
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.5% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a 7.5% increase in unit sales. The increase in used unit sales included a 2.0% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by a continued strong conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic. We believe that strong execution in our stores as well as the impact of our digital initiatives contributed to our continued improvements in conversion. Our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by almost 7% in calendar 2017.
Average retail selling price for fiscal 2018 remained relatively consistent with the prior year, reflecting the net effects of shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class and lower vehicle acquisition costs. Decreases in vehicle acquisition costs in the first half of the year were largely offset by increases in the second half of the year. We believe lower seasonal depreciation was a significant driver of the increase in vehicle acquisition costs in the second half of the year. At the same time, industry new vehicle transaction prices benefited from aggressive new car incentives. We believe the resulting change in the relative affordability of new vehicles versus late-model vehicles was one of the factors contributing to our comparable store used unit sales performance.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 6.7% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from an 8.3% increase in unit sales combined with a 1.7% decline in average retail selling price.  The increase in used unit sales included a 4.3% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit sales performance resulted from an increase in conversion, partially offset by a slight decline in store traffic.
We believe the decline in store traffic was predominantly the result of a decline in customers typically financed by Tier 3 providers. The decline in Tier 3 sales was the result of tightened lending standards by one of our third-party Tier 3 finance providers that we experienced starting in the middle of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and lower applicant volume within this credit tier. Our data indicates that in our television markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 2% in calendar 2016.

The decline in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of lower vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class. We believe the increased supply of late-model vehicles available at auction contributed to the lower acquisition costs, which, in turn, helped to increase the value proposition of late-model used vehicles relative to new cars.

Wholesale Vehicle Sales
Vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are, on average, approximately 10 years old with more than 100,000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 4.7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 resulted from a 4.3% increase in wholesale unit sales. During fiscal 2018, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to an increase in our appraisal buy rate and growth in our store base were partially offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. We believe the appraisal buy rate benefited from strong wholesale industry vehicle valuations, which allowed us to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers. Wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2018 remained consistent with the prior year.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 4.8% decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017 resulted from a 4.1% decrease in wholesale vehicle average selling prices and a 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales. During fiscal 2017, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to the growth in our store base and an improved appraisal buy rate were more than offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. In particular, we experienced a reduced mix of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix, which we believe resulted, at least in part, from the reduced overall industry supply of these model year vehicles due to the decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession. This shift in mix also contributed to the decline in average selling price.
Other Sales and Revenues
Other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of ESPs and GAP (collectively reported in EPP revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), net third-party finance fees, and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales. The fees we pay to the Tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the Tier 2 providers. The mix of our retail vehicles financed by CAF, Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers, or customers that arrange their own financing, may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants, changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions. Changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Other sales and revenues increased 4.7% in fiscal 2018. EPP revenues increased 10.1% compared with the prior year, largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales. The $11.5 million reduction in net third-party finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel, including a decline in our Tier 2 and an increase in our Tier 3 sales.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Other sales and revenues remained consistent in fiscal 2017, as changes in the underlying components offset one another. New vehicle sales declined due to the disposal of two of our four new car franchises during fiscal 2016. EPP revenues increased 14.1% largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales and pricing changes. Net third-party finance fees improved by 37.6% primarily due to the reduced proportion of our used unit sales financed by Tier 3 finance providers.

Used Vehicle Gross Profit
We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold.  The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price.  Our ability to quickly contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit.
We systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement.  Other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments, vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs, and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process.  Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.0% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the 7.5% growth in total used unit sales. Despite an overall trend reported by publicly traded auto retailers in recent quarters towards lower gross profit per unit sold, our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2017. We believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range, subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 8.4% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the 8.3% growth in total used unit sales. Our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2016.
Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit
Our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.  The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles.  Our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit.
Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  The 8.2% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 environment relative to historical trends.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  The 6.6% decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017 reflected the combination of the 0.7% decrease in wholesale unit sales and a $58, or 5.9%, reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit. The decline in gross profit per unit was due in part to the reduced proportion of 7- to 9-year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix. In addition, compared with fiscal 2016, differences in the rate of depreciation relative to changes in our appraisal offers contributed to the decline in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit.
Other Gross Profit
Other gross profit includes profits related to EPP revenues, net third-party finance fees and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning, and new vehicle sales.  We have no cost of sales related to EPP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent revenues paid to us by certain third-party providers. Third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party Tier 3 finance providers.  Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit.

29

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Other gross profit remained consistent in fiscal 2018, as a $19.2 million decrease in service profits and the decrease our more modest comparable store used unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Other gross profit rose 26.3% in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the improvement in EPP revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above. The decrease in new vehicle sales did not significantly affect other gross profit.
Impact of Inflation
Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results.  Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices.  However, changes in average vehicle selling prices impact CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also changes.

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  SG&A expenses for fiscal 2018 increased 8.6%. The increase primarily reflected the 9% growth in our store base during The expense associated with these units was primarily driven by the change in the company’s stock price during the fiscal year. The $19.3 million, or 8.1%, increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives.
Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  SG&A expenses for fiscal 2017 increased 10.1%. The increase primarily reflected the 9% growth in our store base during fiscal costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives.

Interest Expense
Interest expense includes the interest related to short- and long-term debt and finance and capital lease obligations. It does not include interest on the non-recourse notes payable, which is reflected within CAF income.

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  Interest expense increased to $70.7 million in fiscal 2018 versus $56.4 million in fiscal 2017. The increase reflected the combined effects of higher outstanding debt levels and interest rates in fiscal 2018 as well as a reduction in capitalized interest.

30

Fiscal 2017 Versus Fiscal 2016.  Interest expense increased to $56.4 million in fiscal 2017 versus $36.4 million in fiscal 2016. The increase reflected the combination of planned higher outstanding debt levels 2026 and 2028, to investors in a private placement.
Other Expense
During fiscal 2016, we recorded a one-time charge of $8.3 million associated with a property that was no longer planned to be used.

Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 37.6% in fiscal 2018, 37.7% in fiscal 2017 and 38.3% in fiscal 2016. The 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The provision with the most significant impact to CarMax was the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.

The 2017 Tax Act increased our fiscal 2018 income tax expense by $11.9 million, which was made up of the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax expense decreased by $20.8 million, primarily resulting from the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. Our U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 32.7% for fiscal 2018, which reflects the blended federal statutory rate.

These combined effects resulted in a net impact to our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate of 1.1 percentage points. In future quarters, we anticipate Update (“ASU”) ASU 2016-09 regarding share-based compensation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CARMAX AUTO FINANCE

CAF income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by CAF’s portfolio of auto loan of indirect costs.  Although CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to CAF to avoid making subjective allocation decisions.  Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses.

CAF’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years.  Trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. We strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will, in the aggregate and excluding CAF’s Tier 3 originations, result in cumulative net losses in the 2% to 2.5% range over the life of the loans.  Actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors, including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations, economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates.  Current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the CAF business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores.   Because we recognize CAF income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results.

See Note 3 for additional information on CAF income and Note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality.

Fiscal 2018 Versus Fiscal 2017.  CAF income increased 14.1% in fiscal 2018, which was due to an increase in the average managed receivables and a decline in the provision in recent years. The growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2018 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in average amount financed, partially offset by a decrease in CAF']:

['s penetration rate that was caused by an increased mix of credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum.

The total interest margin declined to 5.8% of average managed receivables from 6.1% in fiscal 2016.  This was due to the same reasons noted above in the fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017 comparison.
The provision for loan losses rose to $150.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $101.2 million in fiscal 2016 due to unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017 as well as the growth in managed receivables. While higher loss rates were primarily due to an increase in charge-offs, lower recovery rates also contributed to the unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017, which we believe reflected conditions impacting our industry as a whole.
Tier 3 Loan Originations.  CAF also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our Tier 3 finance providers, in order to better understand the performance of these loans, mitigate risk and add incremental profits.  CAF currently targets originating approximately 5% of the total Tier 3 loan volume; however, this rate may vary over time based on market conditions. A total of $147.5 million and $123.3 million in CAF Tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the CAF portfolio, as well as higher contract rates.  As of February 28, 2018 and 2017, approximately 10% of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding CAF Tier 3 loan balances.

PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES

We currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2019 and between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we will be entering nine new television markets and expanding our presence in six existing television markets. Of the 15 stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019, 10 are in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”) having populations of 600,000 or less, which we define as small markets. We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $340 million in fiscal 2019.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2(X) to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement and CAF. Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.

We currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35% to 45%. In calculating this ratio, we utilize total debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity. We expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to maintain this targeted ratio; however, in any period, we may be outside this range due to seasonal, market, strategic or other factors.

Operating Activities.  During fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities totaled $80.6 million compared in fiscal 2017 and $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016.  The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities.

34

As of February 28, 2018, total inventory was $2.39 billion, representing an increase of $130.1 million, or 5.8%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal in the months following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

As of February 28, 2017, total inventory was $2.26 billion, representing an increase of $328.5 million, or 17.0%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year.  The increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017. Increased inventory levels were also a result of changes in the timing in federal income tax refunds that impacted the timing of anticipated sales in February 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in acquisition costs.

When considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable.  This is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the year.  The resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations.  Including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows:

(1) In connection with our adoption of FASB ASU 2016-09 during the current fiscal year, cash flows related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements are now classified as operating activities, rather than financing activities, in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year']:
NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
