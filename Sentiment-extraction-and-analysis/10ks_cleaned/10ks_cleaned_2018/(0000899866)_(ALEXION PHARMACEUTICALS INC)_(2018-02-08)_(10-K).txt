Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data)
In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties, discussed in the section entitled item 1A “Risk Factors”, and the “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview
Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-changing therapies.
We are the global leader in complement inhibition and have developed and commercialize the first and only approved complement inhibitor to treat patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).  In addition, Alexion has two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare metabolic disorders, hypophosphatasia (HPP) and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).
As the leader in complement biology for over 20 years, Alexion focuses its research efforts on novel molecules and targets in the complement cascade, and its development efforts on the core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology, and metabolic disorders.
Recent Developments
In the first half of 2017, we announced the following key additions to our executive leadership team.

- -----------------------------------------
• Ludwig N. Hantson, Ph.D., Chief Executive

 Officer

- ------------------------------------
• Paul Clancy, Chief Financial Officer

- -----------------------------------------
• Indrani Franchini, J.D., Chief Compliance

 Officer

- ------------------------------------
• Brian Goff, Chief Commercial Officer

- ------------------------------------
• Anne-Marie Law, Chief Human Resource

 Officer

- -------------------------------------
• John Orloff, M.D., Head of Research &

 Development
In the first quarter of 2017, we initiated a company-wide restructuring designed to help position the Company for sustainable, long-term growth that we believe will further allow us to fulfill our mission of serving patients and families with rare diseases. The initial restructuring activities primarily focused on a reduction of the Company's global workforce. In September 2017, we committed to an operational plan to re-align the global organization with its refocused corporate strategy. The re-alignment focuses investments in priority growth areas to maximize leadership in complement and grow the rare disease business. The re-alignment also includes the relocation of the Company's headquarters to Boston, Massachusetts in 2018. Our New Haven, Connecticut site will continue to support employees working in the research and process development laboratories, the clinical supply and quality teams, nurse case management and a number of important enterprise business services. The plan is expected to further reduce the Company's global workforce by approximately 20.0% over the next twelve months. The restructuring will achieve cost savings by focusing the development portfolio, simplifying business structures and processes across the Company's global operations, and closing of multiple Alexion sites, including the Company's Rhode Island manufacturing facility (ARIMF) and certain regional and country-based offices.
In March 2013, we received a Warning Letter (Warning Letter) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at ARIMF. In October 2017, Alexion received a notification from the FDA that the Warning Letter had been resolved. As previously announced, we plan to close ARIMF to align our manufacturing facilities with our ongoing multi-product network manufacturing strategy, which utilizes manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Ireland, and manufacturing capacity through manufacturing partners.
In October 2017, the FDA approved Soliris as a treatment for adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine

56

receptor (AchR) antibody-positive. Additionally, in August 2017, the European Commission (EC) approved the extension of the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory gMG in adults who are AchR antibody-positive.
In December 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan approved Soliris as a treatment for patients with gMG who are AChR antibody-positive and whose symptoms are difficult to control with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or plasmapheresis.
Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates
The significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, “Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We believe the judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:

- --------------------
• Revenue recognition;

- -----------------------
• Contingent liabilities;

- ------------
• Inventories;

- -------------------------
• Share-based compensation;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Valuation of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D);

- ------------------------------------------
• Valuation of contingent consideration; and

- -------------
• Income taxes.

Revenue Recognition
Net Product Sales
Our principal source of revenue is product sales. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and we have no further performance obligations. Depending on these criteria, revenue is usually recorded upon receipt of the product by our customers. Our customers are primarily comprised of distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, hospital buying groups, and other healthcare providers. In some cases, we may also sell to governments and government agencies.

In addition to sales in countries where our products are commercially available, we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving treatment through named-patient programs. The relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named-patient basis where our products have not received final approval for commercial sale.
Because of factors such as the price of our products, the limited number of patients, the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights, our customers often carry limited inventory. We also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels compared to demand, contractual terms, financial strength of distributors and our ability to estimate returns. In some cases, exact quantities of inventory in the channel are not precisely known, requiring us to estimate these amounts. If actual amounts of inventory differ from these estimates, these adjustments could have an impact in the period in which these estimates change.
Historically, we deferred revenue recognition for sales to certain international customers, mainly distributors, until the product was received by the end customer due to various factors, including our inability to estimate product returns. On a regular basis, we review revenue arrangements, including our distributor relationships, to determine whether any changes in these arrangements or historical experience with these customers have an impact on revenue recognition. In the first quarter 2017, we determined that we had sufficient sales experience with certain customers to estimate product returns from such customers. We accounted for this prospectively as a change in estimate and began to recognize revenue for these customers when title to the product and the associated risk of loss passed to the customer. Some customers purchase larger quantities of product less frequently, which may result in revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter. We do not believe these buying patterns increase the risk of product returns or our ability to estimate such returns.
We record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. and other programs outside the U.S., as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale. Our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments, which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made. Generally, the length of time

57

between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months.
We have entered into volume-based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount. Under this type of arrangement, amounts billed in excess of the contractual limitation are repaid to these governments as a rebate. We estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations, based on estimated sales during the limitation period, and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue. Our calculations related to these arrangements require estimation of sales during the limitation period, and adjustments in these estimates may have a material impact in the period in which these estimates change.
We have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

---------------------------------------------------- -------------- ----

 RebatesPayable
Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 36.8
Current provisions relating to sales in current year 89.3
Adjustments relating to prior years (1.8 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in current year (42.8 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years (25.9 )
Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 55.6
Current provisions relating to sales in current year 114.6
Adjustments relating to prior years (1.7 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in current year (50.3 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years (48.7 )
Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 69.5
Current provisions relating to sales in current year 193.8
Adjustments relating to prior years (4.5 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in current year (97.4 )
Payments/credits relating to sales in prior years (62.3 )
Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 99.1

Current provisions relating to sales in the current year increased by $79.2 in 2017 compared to 2016 and $25.3 in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases were primarily due to increased unit volumes in the U.S. and Europe which were subject to rebates. The increase in 2017 was also attributable to increases in rebate rates in certain geographical regions and on certain product sales as compared to the prior year.
We record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue, unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. If both conditions are met, we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense. These costs are typically

known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted revenues, including intercompany revenues, that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception. We record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled.
Amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, such as value-added taxes (VAT) in foreign jurisdictions, are presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of operations and do not impact net product sales.
We evaluate the creditworthiness of customers on a regular basis. In certain European countries, sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined. This is primarily the case in countries where the payer is government-owned or government-funded, which we consider to be creditworthy. The length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries exceeds our credit terms. In countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms, we seek to collect interest. We record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected. For non-interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year, we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue. Subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. We also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful, and we also assess on an ongoing basis whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time of sale.
We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. For additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with certain international accounts receivable balances, refer to the “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

58

Contingent liabilities
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in a material adjustment to our operating results and liquidity.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory on a standard cost basis, which approximates average costs.
We capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale, which may include costs incurred for certain products awaiting regulatory approval. We capitalize inventory produced in preparation of product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Capitalization of such inventory begins when we have (i) obtained positive results in clinical trials that we believe are necessary to support regulatory approval, (ii) concluded that uncertainties regarding regulatory approval have been sufficiently reduced, and (iii) determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit. In evaluating whether these conditions have been met, we consider clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with regulatory authorities, and the compilation of the regulatory application. If we are aware of any material risks or contingencies outside of the standard regulatory review and approval process, or if there are any specific negative issues identified relating to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling of the product that would have a significant negative impact on its future economic benefits, the related inventory would not be capitalized.
Products that have been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities are also used in clinical programs to assess the safety and efficacy of the products for usage in diseases that have not been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The form of product utilized for both commercial and clinical programs is identical and, as a result, the inventory has an “alternative future use” as defined in authoritative guidance. Raw materials and purchased

drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes and, therefore, does not have an “alternative future use”.
For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to us. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. We also recognize expense for raw materials purchased when the raw materials pass quality inspection, and we have an obligation to pay for the materials.
We analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements. Although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire, which would require adjustments to our inventory values. We also apply judgment related to the results of quality tests that we perform throughout the production process, as well as our understanding of regulatory guidelines, to determine if it is probable that inventory will be saleable. These quality tests are performed throughout the pre- and post-production process, and we continually gather information regarding product quality for periods after the manufacturing date. Our products currently have a maximum estimated life range of 36 to 48 months and, based on our sales forecasts, we expect to realize the carrying value of the product inventory. In the future, reduced demand, quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in a material adjustment to inventory levels, which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales.
The determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management. A critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts. We then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand. For inventories that are capitalized in preparation of product launch, we also consider the expected approval date in assessing realizability. To the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold, we will write down the value of inventory. If actual results differ from those estimates, additional inventory write-offs may be required.

59

Share-Based Compensation
We have two share-based compensation plans pursuant to which awards are currently being made: (i) the 2017 Incentive Plan (2017 Plan) and (ii) the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The 2017 Plan replaced the Amended & Restated 2004 Incentive Plan, effective May 10, 2017. Under the 2017 Plan, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock-related awards may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and consultants or advisors of the Company or any subsidiary. Under the ESPP, eligible employees can purchase shares of common stock at a discount semi-annually through payroll deductions. To date, share-based compensation issued under the plans consists of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, including restricted stock units with market and non-market performance conditions, and shares issued under our ESPP.
Compensation expense for our share-based awards is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. Compensation expense reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest and is primarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which typically equals the vesting period. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized using the graded-vesting method.
Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the Black-Scholes model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. Significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility. We also estimate expected term until exercise and the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures. We currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life. Actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates.
For our non-market performance-based awards, we estimate the anticipated achievement of the performance targets, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. These estimates are revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the performance period as necessary. We use payout simulation models to estimate the grant date fair value of market performance-based awards. The payout simulation models assume volatility of our common stock and the common stock of a comparator group of companies, as well as correlations of returns of the price of our common stock and the common stock prices of the comparator group.

The purchase price of common stock under our ESPP is equal to 85% of the lower of (i) the market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period or (ii) the market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 6 month purchase period.
If factors change or we employ different assumptions to value our stock-based awards, the share-based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ materially from our prior recorded amounts.

Valuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D)
We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR&D related to our business combinations. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D, are acquired, we determine the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:

- -----------------------------------------------------
• timing and costs to complete the in-process projects;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and

- ---------------
• discount rates.

We may also utilize a cost approach, which estimates the costs that would be incurred to replace the assets being purchased. Significant inputs into the cost approach include estimated rates of return on historical costs that a market participant would expect to pay for these assets.
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur.
Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment. Impairment testing is performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential

60

impairment. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets are deemed finite-lived and are amortized over a period that best reflects the economic benefits provided by these assets.
If projects are not successfully developed, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets, including IPR&D, may become impaired if the underlying projects do not progress as we initially estimated. We believe that the assumptions used in developing our estimates of intangible asset values were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisitions. However, the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs, profitability, or the events associated with such projects, such as clinical results, may not occur as we estimated at the acquisition date.
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We are organized and operate as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is performed using our overall market value, as determined by our traded share price, compared to our book value of net assets.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones, such as estimated future sales levels of a specific compound; and

- ---------------
• discount rates.

Our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with our business combinations. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted into law. The Tax Act decreased the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate for years beginning after December 31, 2017, and included other domestic and international tax provisions that affect the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a deferred tax benefit of $292.4. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on a provisional basis, see Note 11, “Income Taxes” for additional information.
If our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal our results of operations could be materially impacted.

61

We follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the IRS and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. If we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material adjustments to income tax expense in that period.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a comprehensive new standard which amends revenue recognition principles and provides a single set of criteria for revenue recognition among all industries. The new standard provides a five step framework whereby revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures pertaining to revenue recognition in both interim and annual periods. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for adoption using a full retrospective method, or a modified retrospective method. We will adopt the new standard in the first quarter 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We have reviewed the new standard and have not identified any accounting changes that will materially impact the recognition of our net product sales. We have also completed our review and analysis of customer contracts and determined that the impact of adopting the new standard in the first quarter 2018 will not be material to our financial position and results of operations. We are implementing changes to our accounting policies, internal controls and disclosures to support the new standard; however, these changes will not be significant.
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard that changes accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Companies have the option to either measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. We have elected to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment, which will be recognized in net income. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The adoption of this standard may increase volatility in our net income as changes in observable prices of equity investments without readily determinable fair values

62

will be recorded in net income and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard requiring that the rights and obligations arising from leases be recognized on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. The new standard also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, as well as significant management estimates utilized. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective adoption. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard on our financial condition and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued a new standard intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments. One aspect of the standard requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation as a reduction or increase to tax expense in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital. The amendments also require recognition of excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Furthermore, the amendment requires that excess tax benefits be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of a financing activity. We elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2016. We also elected to continue to estimate the impact of forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized each period rather than account for forfeitures as they occur.
In October 2016, the FASB issued a new income tax standard that eliminates the exception for an intra-entity asset transfer other than inventory. Under

the new standard, entities should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer's jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. We elected to early adopt this standard in the first quarter 2017. As a result of the adoption, in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an $18.8 decrease in retained earnings, primarily resulting from the elimination of previously recorded prepaid tax assets.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new standard that clarifies the definition of a business and determines when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. This framework requires that if substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the assets would not represent a business. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We anticipate that the adoption of this new standard will result in more transactions being accounted for as asset acquisitions.
In August 2017, the FASB issued a new standard intended to improve and simplify certain aspects of the accounting for hedges. The new standard is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard on our financial condition and results of operations.

The components of this increase in net product sales for December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 are as follows:

The increase in net product sales for fiscal year 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes of 16.8%. This increase in unit volumes is due to increased global demand for Soliris therapy for patients with PNH or aHUS, as well as increased sales of Strensiq and Kanuma during 2017 as a result of our continuing efforts to identify and reach more patients with HPP and LAL-D globally.
The components of this increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 are as follows:

The increase in net product sales for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes of 21.8% due to increased demand globally for Soliris therapy for patients with PNH or aHUS and sales of Strensiq and Kanuma during 2016.
The positive impact of volume on net product sales was offset by the negative impact on foreign exchange of 2.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The negative impact on foreign exchange of $74.2, or 2.9%, was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (inclusive of hedging activity) versus the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015. The negative impact was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble, and the British Pound. We recorded a gain in revenue of $73.0 and $117.9 related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

66

We have historically deferred revenue recognition for sales to certain international customers, mainly distributors, until the product was received by the end customer due to various product returns from such customers. As a result, we began to recognize revenue for these customers when title to the product and the associated risk of loss passed to the customer. Some customers may purchase larger quantities of product less frequently, which may result in revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of our products.
The following table summarizes cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

The increase in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same periods in 2016, was primarily due to additional asset related charges of $152.1 associated with the planned closure of the ARIMF facility that was announced in the third quarter of 2017 as part of the restructuring. These charges primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and the impairment of manufacturing assets.
In the first quarter 2015, we recorded an expense of $24.4 associated with a portion of a single manufacturing campaign at a third party manufacturer for Strensiq. The cost was comprised of raw materials, internal overhead and external production costs.
Exclusive of the items mentioned above, cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales were

8.5%, 8.4% and 8.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We expect our cost of sales to decrease as a percentage of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the impact of the restructuring related additional asset charges in 2017.

67

Research and Development Expense
Our research and development expense includes personnel, facility and direct costs associated with the research and development (R&D) of our product candidates, as well as product development costs.
Direct expenses are comprised of costs paid for clinical development, product development and discovery research, as well as costs associated with strategic licensing agreements we have entered into with third parties. Clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab, ALXN1210 and other product candidates. Product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development and regulatory functions, including manufacturing of material for clinical and research activities and other administrative costs incurred during product development. Discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of our products and other product candidates. Licensing agreement costs include upfront and milestone payments made in connection with strategic licensing arrangements we have entered into with third parties. Clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs, while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated.
Other R&D expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel, to maintain our facilities and equipment, and other occupancy costs associated with our research and development efforts. These costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products, our product development and our discovery research efforts. These costs have not been allocated directly to each program.
The following graph provides information regarding research and development expenses:

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred R&D expenses of $878.4, an increase of $121.2, or 16.0%, versus the $757.2 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily related to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $23.0 in direct clinical development expenses relates primarily to the expansion of studies for ALXN1210.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $37.2 in direct product development expenses related primarily to an increase in costs associated with the manufacturing of material for ALXN1210 and ALXN6000 clinical research activities.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $39.9 in licensing agreement expenses related to upfront payments made in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $16.9 in payroll and benefits related primarily to increased bonus performance and stock compensation expense.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $17.4 in facilities and other expenses related primarily to accelerated depreciation on assets that support R&D activities associated with the 2017 restructuring activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred research and development expenses of $757.2, an increase of $47.7, or 6.7%, versus the $709.5 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to the following:

68

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $52.6 in direct clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies for ALXN1210, sebelipase alfa, and eculizumab.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $47.8 in direct product development expenses related primarily to an increase in costs associated with the manufacturing of material for increased clinical research activities and clinical studies.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $9.8 in discovery research expenses primarily related to increases in external research expenses associated with our collaboration agreements.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase of $55.7 in payroll and benefit expense primarily related to the additional headcount acquired as part of the Synageva acquisition on June 22, 2015 and the continued global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decrease of $120.2 in licensing agreement expenses related to upfront payments made in the first quarter 2015.

The following graph summarizes accumulated direct expenses related to our clinical development programs. Please refer to Item 1, “Business”, for a description of each of these programs:

(a) From 1992 through 2006, substantially all research and development expenses were related to two products, eculizumab and pexelizumab. We obtained approval in the U.S. for eculizumab for PNH in 2007 and for aHUS in 2010, and we ceased development of pexelizumab in 2006.
(b) Unallocated costs shared across various development programs.

The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks. We cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs. We could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated. For additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs, please refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We expect our research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017. For additional information on our development programs, please refer to “Product and Development Programs” in Item I “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Our selling, general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel, corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products. These selling, general and administrative costs include: corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation; marketing and sales operations in support of our products; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and

support personnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit, government affairs and our global corporate compliance program.
The table below provides information regarding selling, general and administrative expense:

 ----------------------------------------------------

 Salary, benefits and other labor expense
 External selling, general and administrative expense

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,094.4, an increase of $141.4, or 14.8%, versus the $953.0 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily related to the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in salary, benefits and other labor expenses of $81.5, primarily related to increase of commercial activities to support the continued global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma and the launch of Soliris for gMG. Employee related costs associated with executive leadership changes and incentive compensation also increased.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $59.9. The increase was primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions and additional professional services, offset in part by decreases in advertising and promotional cost as compared to 2016. The increase was also due to asset impairment charges that were recorded in 2017 related to restructuring activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of $953.0, an increase of $90.4, or 10.5%, versus the $862.6 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in external selling, general and administrative expenses of $83.9. The

70

increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses from investigations overseen by the Audit and Finance Committee relating to the SEC and DOJ investigations as well as the Audit Committee Investigation that occurred in the fourth quarter 2016. The increase was also attributable to additional facilities costs as a result of continuing growth of operations worldwide.
We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

Amortization expense associated with purchased intangible assets was $320.1, $322.2 and $116.6 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization expense is primarily associated with intangible assets related to Strensiq and Kanuma. In the third quarter 2015, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq and Kanuma.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the change in fair value of contingent consideration expense associated with our prior business combinations was $41.0, $35.7 and $64.2, respectively. The change in the fair value of contingent consideration will fluctuate based on the timing of recognition of changes in the probability of achieving and the expected timing of milestone payments. For

the year ended December 31, 2017, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration expense primarily reflect changes in the expected timing of payments of contingent consideration, as well as the interest component of contingent consideration related to the passage of time.
Acquisition-related Costs
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, acquisition-related costs associated with our business combinations included the following:

 ----------------- -----------------

 Transaction Costs Integration Costs

Acquisition-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 resulted from the acquisition of Synageva in 2015.
Restructuring Expenses

In the first quarter of 2017, we initiated a company-wide restructuring designed to help position the Company for sustainable, long-term growth that we believe will further allow us to fulfill our mission of serving patients and families with rare diseases. The initial restructuring activities primarily focused on a reduction of the Company's global workforce. In September 2017, we committed to an operational plan to re-align the global organization with its refocused corporate strategy. The re-alignment focuses investments in priority growth areas to maximize leadership in complement and grow the rare disease business. The re-alignment also includes the

71

relocation of the Company's headquarters to Boston, Massachusetts in 2018. Our New Haven, Connecticut site will continue to support employees working in the research and process development laboratories, the clinical supply and quality teams, nurse case management and a number of important enterprise business services. The plan is expected to further reduce the Company's global workforce by approximately 20.0%. The restructuring will achieve cost savings by focusing the development portfolio, simplifying business structures and processes across the Company's global operations, and closing of multiple Alexion sites, including ARIMF and certain regional and country-based offices.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded restructuring expenses of $104.6. We expect to pay substantially all accrued amounts related to the 2017 restructuring activities by the end of 2018. We currently estimate incurring additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $30.0 to $70.0 in 2018 related to the 2017 restructuring activities, primarily related to other costs. As we continue to execute our strategic business plan and global footprint, we may incur restructuring expenses in 2018 that are materially different from our current estimate.
In connection with the previous relocation of our corporate headquarters to New Haven, Connecticut, we entered into a lease termination agreement in December 2015 for the previous corporate headquarters located in Cheshire, Connecticut. We recorded contract termination fees of $11.2 in restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In conjunction with the acquisition and integration of Synageva, we recorded restructuring expense of $13.3, primarily related to employee costs, during 2015. Synageva restructuring charges were not material for the year ended December 31, 2016.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced plans to relocate our European headquarters from Lausanne, Switzerland to Zurich, Switzerland. The relocation of our European headquarters supports our operational needs based on growth in the European region. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of $3.6 and $17.6 respectively, related to this event.
Impairment of Intangible Assets

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we reviewed SBC-103, an early stage clinical indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the Synageva acquisition as part of our annual impairment testing. The estimated fair value that can be obtained for this asset from a market participant in an arm’s length transaction was determined to be $31.0, which was lower than the carrying amount of the asset. As a result, in the fourth quarter 2016, we recognized an impairment charge of $85.0 to write-down this asset to fair value. In the second quarter 2017, due to clinical results, we recognized an impairment charge of $31.0 related to our SBC-103 acquired in-process research and development asset to write-down the asset to fair value, which was determined to be de minimis.

72

As of December 31, 2017, we reviewed the Kanuma asset for impairment and determined that there were no indicators of impairment. We will continue to review the related valuation and accounting of this asset in future quarters as new information becomes available to us. Changes to assumptions used in our net cash flow projections may result in impairment charges in subsequent periods. The net book value of the Kanuma intangible asset as of December 31, 2017 is $3,512.8.
Other Income and (Expense)
The following table provides information regarding other income and expense:

 ----------------------

 Investment Income
 Interest Expense
 Other Income (expense)

The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to us borrowing $3,500.0 under a term loan facility in conjunction with the acquisition of Synageva on June 22, 2015. The increase was also attributable to increases in interest expense associated with our facility lease obligations.
Income Taxes

The income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is attributable to the U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes on our profitable operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $104.5 and an effective tax rate of 19.1%, compared to an income tax expense of $176.8 and $353.7 and an effective tax rate of 30.7% and 71.0% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act decreased the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21.0%, imposed a minimum tax on foreign earnings and incorporated a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted foreign earnings. We have incorporated the impact of the Tax Act in our results of operations or have calculated provisional amounts for the tax effects of the Tax Act that can be reasonably estimated for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Tax Act resulted in an increase to tax expense of $45.8 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase includes a transition tax expense of $177.9 and deferred tax expense related to the new GILTI minimum tax of $165.4, partially offset by the $297.5 benefit of re-measuring balance sheet taxes to the new 21.0% US federal tax rate. The re-measurement benefit includes $292.4 related to decreases to our net deferred tax liability and $5.1 related to decreases to income taxes payable. The deferred tax expense related to the GILTI minimum tax

73

includes incremental deferred tax of $236.9, net of a related $71.5 decrease for uncertain tax positions.
The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2017, from 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the net increase to tax expense in 2017 of $45.8 attributable to the Tax Act, offset by decreases attributable to the deferred tax cost of $119.3 associated with the distribution of earnings from our captive foreign partnership in 2016 and the conclusion of the IRS examination of our 2013 and 2014 tax years in 2017. The impact of the enactment of the Tax Act increased our effective tax rate in 2017 by 8.4%. The 2016 distribution increased our 2016 effective tax rate by 20.7%. Conclusion of the IRS examination resulted in a decrease to our 2017 effective tax rate of approximately 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2016, from 71.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $315.6 tax charge we recorded in 2015 related to the integration of Synageva assets into our captive foreign partnership. This one-time charge increased our effective tax rate in 2015 by approximately 63.0%. This decrease was partially offset by the $119.3 of deferred tax expense we recognized in 2016 attributable to first quarter distributions from our foreign captive partnership, which increased our 2016 effective tax rate by 20.7%.
 We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where realization is not certain. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:

----------------------------------------- ----------------- ------- ----------------- ------- - -------

 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
Cash and cash equivalents $ 584.4 $ 966.0
Marketable securities 889.7 327.4
Long-term debt (includes current portion) 2,906.3 3,081.3

Current assets $ 2,953.9 $ 2,578.2
Current liabilities 952.5 822.9
Working capital $ 2,001.4 $ 1,755.3

The aggregate increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily attributable to cash generated from operations and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation arrangements. Partially offsetting these increases was cash utilized to repurchase shares of common stock, principal payments on our term loan, and purchases of property, plant, and equipment.
We expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales in 2018. We also expect reduced capital investment in 2018 as compared to 2017. We anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned.
We have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to be able to fund our operations, including principal and interest payments on our credit facility and contingent payments from our acquisitions principally through our cash flows from operations. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings or from other sources, if necessary for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes.
Financial Instruments
Until required for use in the business, we may invest our cash reserves in money market funds, bank deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, and high-quality marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. The stated objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital, provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions.
Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and our derivative contracts. At December 31, 2017, four customers accounted for 57.7% of the accounts receivable balance, with these individual customers accounting for 10.2% to 18.9% of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2016, three customers accounted for 47.0% of the accounts receivable balance, with individual customers accounting for 13.7% to 19.1% of the accounts receivable balance.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers accounted for 37.0% of our product sales, with these individual customers ranging from 10.8% to 15.0% of product sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, three customers accounted for

74

36.7% of our product sales, with these individual customers ranging from 10.0% to 16.0% of product sales. For the year ended December 31, 2015, three customers accounted for 38.2% of our product sales, with these individual customers ranging from 10.0% to 17.5% of product sales.
We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from wholesale distributors, public hospitals and other government entities. We monitor the financial performance of our customers so that we can appropriately respond to changes in their credit worthiness. We operate in certain jurisdictions where weakness in economic conditions can result in extended collection periods. We continue to monitor these conditions and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to collection of our accounts receivable.
We manage our foreign currency transaction risk and interest rate risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. As of December 31, 2017, we had foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $2,708.1. These outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value liability of $47.5, of which $27.0 is included in other current assets and noncurrent assets and $74.5 is included in other current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $2,331.3. These outstanding interest rate swap contracts had a net fair value of $21.8 included in other current assets and noncurrent assets. The counterparties to these contracts are large domestic and multinational commercial banks, and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material.
At December 31, 2017, our financial assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value. We have classified our financial assets and liabilities as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 assets consist of mutual fund investments and equity securities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, but substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Our Level 2 assets consist primarily of institutional money market funds, commercial paper, municipal bonds, reverse repurchase agreements, U.S. and

foreign government-related debt, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit and derivative contracts. Our Level 2 liabilities consist also of derivative contracts. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Our Level 3 liabilities consist of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.
Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Obligations
The purchase agreements for our business combinations include contingent payments totaling up to $741.0 that will become payable if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved. Of these milestone amounts, $451.0 and $290.0 of the contingent payments relate to development and commercial milestones, respectively. We do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near-term, and, during the next 12 months, we do not expect to make any milestone payments associated with our prior business combinations. As additional future payments become probable, we will evaluate methods of funding payments, which could be made from available cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing.
License Agreements
In December 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. that allows us to use drug-delivery technology in the development of subcutaneous formulations for our portfolio of products for up to four targets. Due to the early stage of the assets we are licensing, we recorded expense for the upfront payment of $40.0 during the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we could be required to pay an additional $160.0 for each target developed, subject to achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on commercial sales.
In January 2015, we entered into a license agreement with a third party to obtain an exclusive research, development and commercial license for specific therapeutic molecules. Due to the early stage of these assets, we recorded expense for the upfront payment of $50.0 during the first quarter 2015. In addition, as of December 31, 2017 we could be required to pay up to an additional $822.0 if certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones are met over time, as well as royalties on commercial sales.
In March 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third party that allowed us to exercise an option with another third party for exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license rights to a specialized technology and other intellectual property, and we simultaneously

exercised the option. Due to the early stage of these assets, we recorded expense for the payments of $47.0 during the first quarter 2015.
In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a third party that allows us to identify and optimize drug candidates. Alexion will have the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products arising from the collaboration. Due to the early stage of the assets we are licensing in connection with the collaboration, we recorded expense for the upfront payment of $15.0 during the first quarter 2015. In the third quarter of 2017 we terminated our agreement with this third party.
In addition, we have entered into other license agreements under which we would be required to pay up to an additional $488.0 if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are met.
We do not expect the payments associated with milestones under our licensing agreements to have a significant impact on our liquidity in the near-term. During the next 12 months, we expect to make milestone payments related to our license agreements of approximately $20.0.
Financing Lease Obligations
In November 2012, we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space to be constructed in New Haven, Connecticut. The term of the lease commenced in 2015 and will expire in 2030, with a renewal option of ten years. Although we do not legally own the premises, we are deemed to be the owner of the building due to the substantial improvements directly funded during the construction period based on applicable accounting guidance for build-to-suit leases. Accordingly, the landlord’s costs of constructing the facility during the construction period are required to be capitalized, as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation in our consolidated balance sheet. Construction of the new facility was completed and the building was placed into service in the first quarter 2016. Associated with this arrangement we recognized interest expense of $14.2, $14.0, and $4.9 for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our total facility lease obligation was $134.6 and $136.5, respectively, recorded within other current liabilities and facility lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheets.
During the third quarter 2015, we entered into an agreement with Lonza Group AG and its affiliates (Lonza) whereby Lonza will construct a new manufacturing facility dedicated to Alexion at one of its existing facilities. As a result of our contractual right to full capacity of the new manufacturing facility, a portion of the payments under the agreement are considered to be lease payments and a portion as

payment for the supply of inventory. Although we will not legally own the premises, we are deemed to be the owner of the manufacturing facility during the construction period based on applicable accounting guidance for build-to-suit leases due to our involvement during the construction period. Accordingly, the landlord’s costs of constructing the facility during the construction period are required to be capitalized, as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation in our consolidated balance sheet. The completion of the facility, including obtaining regulatory approval, is expected in the first half of 2019. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a construction-in-process asset of $180.6 and $118.4, respectively, and an offsetting facility lease obligation of $159.1 and $106.9, respectively, within other current liabilities and facility lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheets.
In September 2017, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 150,000 square feet of office space that is currently being constructed in Boston, Massachusetts. The term of the lease will commence upon the landlord's substantial completion of our premises and will expire on the thirteenth anniversary of commencement, with an option to renew for up to an additional ten years. Although we will not legally own the premises, due to our involvement during the construction period, we are deemed to be the owner of the portion of the building that we will lease based on applicable accounting guidance for build-to-suit leases. Accordingly, the landlord's costs of constructing the facility during the construction period are required to be capitalized, as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation in our consolidated balance sheet. The landlord's construction of the building is in process and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a construction-in-process asset of $64.1 and an offsetting facility lease obligation of $59.6 associated with our relative portion of the building within our consolidated balance sheets.
Long-term Debt
On June 22, 2015, Alexion entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $3,500.0 term loan facility and a $500.0 revolving facility. Borrowings under the term loan facility are payable in quarterly installments equal to 1.25% of the original loan amount, beginning December 31, 2015. Final repayment of the term loan and any draw down of revolving credit loans are due on June 22, 2020. In addition to borrowings in which prior notice is required, the revolving credit facility includes a sublimit of $100.0 in the form of letters of credit and borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as

76

swingline loans, of up to $25.0. Borrowings can be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $2,906.3 outstanding on the term loan. As of December 31, 2017, we had open letters of credit of $2.2 that offset our borrowing availability on the revolving facility.
Manufacturing Obligations
We have supply agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacture of Soliris and Strensiq, which requires payments to Lonza at the inception of contract and upon the initiation and completion of product manufactured. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by Lonza, which depends upon our commercial requirements, the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of ARIMF.
We have various agreements with Lonza, with remaining total non-cancellable commitments of approximately $1,098.9 through 2028. Certain commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances. If we terminate certain supply agreements with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement. Under an existing arrangement with Lonza, we also pay Lonza a royalty on sales of Soliris manufactured at ARIMF and a payment with respect to sales of Soliris manufactured at Lonza facilities.
In addition to Lonza, we have non-cancellable commitments of approximately $27.3 through 2019 with other third party manufacturers.

Taxes
We have recorded tax on the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign corporation (CFC) subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded a one-time U.S. federal transition tax of $177.9 imposed on the undistributed earnings of our CFC subsidiaries as required by the Tax Act. In addition, we recorded an immaterial tax expense related to the incremental withholding, foreign local, and U.S. state taxes we would expect to incur on a dividend distribution of these earnings to the U.S. To the extent CFC earnings may not be repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend distribution due to limitations imposed by law, we have not recorded the related potential tax. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on a provisional basis, see Note 11, “Income Taxes” for additional information.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In November 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we are not obligated to acquire a particular number of shares. The repurchase program may be discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the future acquisition of shares with an aggregate value of up to $1,000.0 under the repurchase program, which superseded all prior repurchase programs. Under the program, we repurchased 4.0 and 3.1 shares of our common stock at a cost of $463.6 and $430.6 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there is a total of $536.4 remaining for repurchases under the program.

Cash Flows
 The following summarizes our net change in cash and cash equivalents:

--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------ ------- ------- ------ - - ------ -

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 $Change
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,115.6 $ 1,086.3 $ 29.3
Net cash used in investing activities (918.3 ) (287.6 ) (630.7 )
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (596.6 ) (836.2 ) 239.6
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 17.7 (6.6 ) 24.3
Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (381.6 ) $ (44.1 ) $ (337.5 )

Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operations in 2017 were $1,115.6 compared to $1,086.3 in 2016. The increase was driven by an increase in gross margin on product sales of $424.0 resulting primarily from an increase in global demand for Soliris as well as

increased sales of Strensiq and Kanuma during 2017 as a result of continuing efforts to identify and reach more patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. Partially offsetting this increase was employee separation payments in connection with the 2017 restructuring activities, as well as increases in clinical R&D, product

77

development and selling, general, and administrative expenses during 2017.
We expect increases in cash flows from operations which will be highly dependent on sales levels, and the related cash collections from sales of our products.
Investing Activities
Cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $918.3 compared to $287.6 in 2016. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases and maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $558.9 in 2017 compared to a net cash inflow of $50.7 in 2016.
During 2017, we also had higher cash outlays associated with the purchase of property, plant and

equipment of $357.3, compared to $332.7 in 2016. The significant spending on property, plant and equipment in 2017 relates primarily to the construction of our new biologics manufacturing facilities in Ireland.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities in 2017 were $596.6 compared to $836.2 in 2016. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to principal payments on our credit facility of $175.0 in 2017, compared to $375.0 in 2016.

Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years. These do not include potential milestone payments and assume non-termination of agreements.
These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change:

(1) Interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2017. Interest that is fixed, associated to our interest rate swaps, is calculated based on the fixed interest swap rate at December 31, 2017.
(2) Facility lease obligations include the lease agreement signed in November 2012, for office and laboratory space in New Haven, Connecticut and the lease agreement signed in September 2017 for office space in Boston, Massachusetts. Although we do not legally own these premises, we were deemed to be the owner of the buildings during the construction period based on applicable accounting guidance for build-to-suit leases due to our involvement during the construction period. Accordingly, the landlord’s costs of constructing the facility are required to be capitalized, as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding facility lease obligation in our consolidated balance sheet.
(3) Clinical and manufacturing development commitments include only non-cancellable commitments, including all Lonza agreements, at December 31, 2017.

The contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and

other factors described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax

78

matters of $60.9 at December 31, 2017 was not included within the table above. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2017. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
Contingent payments related to business acquisitions completed in prior years or license agreements are not included within the table above, as the timing of payment for these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2017. Contingent payments associated with these business combinations total up to $741.0 which will become payable if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved. During the next 12 months, we do not expect to make milestone payments associated with our prior business combinations. License commitments include contingent payments that will become payable if and when certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. During the next 12 months, we expect to make milestone payments related to our license agreements of approximately $20.0.
Future obligations related to our defined benefit plans are not included within the table above, as the timing and amounts of these payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2017. The total unfunded obligation on our defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2017 was $19.2. Our unfunded obligation can be impacted by changes in the laws and regulations, interest rates, investment returns, and other variables.
Credit Facilities
On June 22, 2015, Alexion entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $3,500.0 term loan facility and a $500.0 revolving credit facility maturing in five years. Borrowings under the term loan are payable in quarterly installments equal to 1.25% of the original loan amount, beginning December 31, 2015. Final repayment of the term loan and revolving credit loans are due on June 22, 2020. In addition to borrowings in which prior notice is required, the revolving credit facility includes a sublimit of $100.0 in the form of letters of credit and borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, of up to $25.0. Borrowings can be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. With the consent of the lenders and the administrative agent, and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, we may increase the term loan facility and/or the revolving credit facility in an amount that does not cause our consolidated net leverage ratio to exceed the maximum allowable amount.

Under the Credit Agreement we may elect that the loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either a base rate or a Eurodollar rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margins on base rate loans range from 0.25% to 1.00% and the applicable margins on Eurodollar loans range from 1.25% to 2.00%, in each case depending upon our consolidated net leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement).
Our obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of Alexion’s foreign and domestic subsidiaries and secured by liens on certain of Alexion’s and its subsidiaries’ equity interests, subject to certain exceptions.
The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. Further, the Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, and engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan.
Operating Leases
Our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease office space in the U.S. and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization.
We believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facilities, together with third party manufacturing facilities, will be adequate for our on-going activities.
In addition to the minimum rental commitments on our operating leases we may also be required to pay amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.

79

Commercial Commitments
Our commercial commitments consist of research and development, license, operational, clinical development, and manufacturing cost commitments, along with anticipated supporting arrangements, subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses. The timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs, which may or may not be realized, are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans. Our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with Lonza described above. Our commitments with Lonza do not include amounts for estimated CPI adjustments.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...
