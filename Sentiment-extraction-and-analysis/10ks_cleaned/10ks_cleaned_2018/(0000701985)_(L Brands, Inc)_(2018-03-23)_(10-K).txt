ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.
Executive Overview
We have a multi-year goal to grow our business and increase operating margins for our brands by focusing on these key business priorities:

- -----------------------------------
• Grow our business in North America;

- -------------------------------------------
• Extend our core brands internationally; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Focus on the fundamentals of our business including managing inventory, expenses and capital with discipline.

We also continue to focus on:

- ------------------------------------
• Attracting and retaining top talent;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and

- ------------------------------------
• Returning value to our shareholders.

The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:
Grow our business in North America
Our first focus is on the substantial growth opportunity in North America.
At Victoria's Secret, we are very focused on improving performance by staying close to our customer, improving the customer experience in stores and online and improving our assortment. We are developing and launching new products, especially in core bra, panties, sport and PINK beauty. In addition to resetting product, we are focused on attracting, engaging and retaining high-value, dual-channel customers. We will continue delivering brand-accretive marketing to grow the customer base. In 2018, our square footage at Victoria's Secret North America is expected to remain flat. In our direct channel, we are investing in infrastructure and technology to support growth.
The core of Bath & Body Works is its body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We have further opportunity to grow by creating a Bath & Body Works and White Barn shop-in-shop at many of our store locations. In 2018, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America by about 3% through the opening of approximately 30 net new Bath & Body Works stores and the remodeling of existing stores. Additionally, www.BathandBodyWorks.com continues to exhibit significant year-over-year growth.
Extend our core brands internationally
We believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have separate, dedicated teams that have taken a methodical, "test and learn" approach to expansion. We began our international expansion with the acquisition of La Senza at the beginning of 2007, and we've continued to expand our presence outside of North America by opening company-owned stores, as well as increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Victoria’s Secret International Stores — We have made significant progress in expanding Victoria's Secret internationally. We opened our first seven Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores in Greater China during 2017, and have plans to open approximately 10 more in 2018. In the U.K., we opened three new Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and two PINK stores in 2017, bringing the total to 23. In 2018, we plan to open two Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and one PINK store in the U.K. Additionally, in 2017 we opened our first Victoria's Secret full-assortment store in Ireland.

Further, our partners opened nine Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores in 2017 with notable openings in Poland, Russia, Turkey and the Middle East, bringing the total to 32 Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and five PINK stores. Our partners plan to open approximately 20 Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and five PINK stores in 2018.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories Stores — We operate 29 company-owned Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in Greater China and expect to open approximately 10 more in 2018. Our partners opened six net new Victoria’s Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in 2017, bringing the total to 397. These stores are located in local markets, airports and tourist destinations, and are focused on Victoria’s Secret branded beauty and accessory products. Our partners plan to open approximately 40 and close approximately 25 Victoria’s Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Bath & Body Works International Stores — Our partners opened 26 net new Bath & Body Works stores in 2017, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to 185. Our partners plan to open approximately 50 additional stores in 2018.

Focus on the fundamentals of our business
We are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include our customers, core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.

2017 Overview
We utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for fiscal 2017 represents the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, and the results for 2016 and 2015 represent the 52-week periods ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. The 2017 fourth quarter consists of a 14-week period versus a 13-week period in 2016. The extra week accounted for approximately $160 million in incremental sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Results were mixed in 2017. Our net sales increased $58 million to $12.632 billion driven by the extra week in the fiscal year, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of 3%. Our operating income decreased $275 million to $1.728 billion, and our operating income rate decreased to 13.7% from 15.9%. Growth at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria’s Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• At Bath & Body Works, sales increased 8%, driven by a positive 2% comparable store sales increase and a 24% increase in sales in the direct channel. Operating income increased 5%. We worked a large part of the year to refine our merchandise mix. Through new products and relaunches we improved our assortment, created a large amount of newness and learned even more about our customer and what she wants most. We ended the year with 425 new concept stores which include the White Barn design. While the investment in these stores results in near-term financial pressure, they continue to drive significant sales increases and importantly present a new, compelling store design to our customers.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the Victoria’s Secret business, while we continue to see strong growth in our direct channel (18% in go-forward merchandise categories for 2017), store traffic levels continue to be challenging despite increased marketing and promotion (comparable store sales for go-forward merchandise categories declined 6% in 2017), as we continue to build back our customer base. Operating income for the Victoria’s Secret segment declined 21% in 2017. By business unit:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Our PINK business achieved a mid-single digit sales increase for the year, as strong growth in the bra and panty business was somewhat offset by a decline in the loungewear business. We are leveraging our speed capabilities in the PINK business to address fashion issues in the loungewear business and improve results.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ In the Victoria’s Secret Lingerie business, although our results improved throughout the year, total sales in go-forward categories declined in the mid-single digit range in 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The Victoria’s Secret Beauty business improved in 2017. Sales increased in the low-single digit range, and the merchandise margin rate increased, as the customer responded to a more focused assortment and new products and fashion.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating income in our international segment declined by $35 million to $5 million. Our partner-based businesses are doing well, with solid operating income growth for the year. The operating loss related to our company-owned business in China increased as we continue to invest for significant growth. We opened seven new Victoria’s Secret full-assortment stores in China in 2017 and began e-commerce on the global Tmall website. Our company-owned business in the U.K. was challenged in 2017, comparable sales and operating income both declined, and we are very focused on improving performance.

We are equipped for success, driven by strong brands which lead their categories and an experienced and talented leadership team. We see significant growth opportunities both in and outside of North America. Although our performance in 2017 did not meet our expectations, we continue to hold leadership positions in the segments of retail in which we do business.
For additional information related to our 2017 financial performance, see “Results of Operations – 2017 Compared to 2016.”
Our capital expenditures of $707 million included $601 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.
We also are committed to returning value to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase programs. During 2017, we paid $686 million in regular dividends and repurchased $445 million of our common stock. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $20 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Adjusted Financial Information

In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2017, 2016 and 2015 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace

the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

2018 Outlook
The global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.
At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments and marketing, store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us. We believe that our brands, which lead their categories and offer high emotional content to customers at accessible prices, are well positioned heading into 2018.

(a) The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2016 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis.

The results by segment are as follows:
Victoria’s Secret
For 2017, net sales decreased $394 million to $7.387 billion, comparable sales and comparable store sales both decreased 8%. Net sales decreased primarily due to strategic decisions to exit the swim and apparel categories, a decline in core bra sales and a decline in panties as we reposition the category. These results were partially offset by increases in PINK, sport and beauty driven by merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.
The decrease in comparable store sales was driven primarily by a decrease in total transactions due to reduced traffic, impacted significantly by the exit of certain categories.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven primarily by increases in the promotional and clearance activity described above, partially offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses due to decreased catalogue costs.
Bath & Body Works
For the fourth quarter of 2016, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars primarily related to the increase in net sales. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by an increase in occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by an increase in occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate, a decrease in the merchandise margin rate at Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories and the negative impacts of foreign currency at Victoria's Secret U.K.
General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses
For the fourth quarter of 2016, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $32 million to $956 million primarily driven by increased store selling expenses related to higher sales volume and investments in selling to improve the customer experience, increased marketing to drive traffic and corporate expenses in Greater China, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.
The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 21.3% from 21.0% due to store selling, marketing and our investment in China, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense.
Other Income and Expense
Interest Expense
The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015:

--------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- - -----

Fourth Quarter 2016 2015
Average daily borrowings (in millions) $ 5,779 $ 5,756
Average borrowing rate (in percentages) 6.9 % 6.8 %

For the fourth quarter of 2016, our interest expense increased $1 million to $98 million primarily due to an increase in the average borrowing rate.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the fourth quarter of 2016, our effective tax rate decreased to 29.2% from 35.2%. The 2016 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. The 2015 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a rate lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by domestic subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $348 million as of February 3, 2018.
We believe in returning value to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase programs. During 2017, we paid $686 million in regular dividends and repurchased $445 million of our common stock. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs.

(a) The balance includes a fair value interest rate hedge adjustment which increased the debt balance by $2 million as of January 28, 2017.

Issuance of Notes
In January 2018, we issued $500 million of 5.25% notes due in February 2028. The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The proceeds from the issuance were $495 million, which were net of issuance costs of $5 million. These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of February 2028 and are included within Long-term Debt on the February 3, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In June 2016, we issued $700 million of 6.75% notes due in July 2036. The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors. The proceeds from the issuance were $692 million, which were net of issuance costs of $8 million. These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of July 2036 and are included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Redemption of Notes
In January 2018, we used the proceeds from the 2028 Notes to redeem the $500 million 2019 Notes for $540 million. The pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt was $45 million (after-tax loss of $29 million), which includes write-offs of unamortized issuance costs and discounts and losses related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2019 Notes. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2017 Consolidated Statement of Income.

In July 2016, we used the proceeds from the 2036 Notes to redeem the $700 million 2017 Notes for $742 million. The pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt was $36 million (after-tax net loss of $22 million), which is net of gains of $7 million related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2017 Notes. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income.
Revolving Facility
In May 2017, we entered into an amendment and restatement ("Amendment") of our secured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Facility"). The Amendment maintains the aggregate amount of the commitments of the lenders under the

 40

Table of Contents

Revolving Facility at $1 billion and extends the termination date from July 18, 2019 to May 11, 2022. The Amendment allows certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.
In addition, the Amendment reduced the commitment fees payable under the Revolving Facility, which are based on our long-term credit rating, to 0.25% per annum. The Amendment did not modify our quantitative covenant requirements, but did provide an increased limit on restricted payments in the event we do not meet the criteria to make these payments without limitation and provides greater flexibility with respect to our ability to grant liens on assets.
We incurred fees related to the Amendment of the Revolving Facility of $5 million, which were capitalized and recorded in Other Assets on the February 3, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Revolving Facility.
The Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are 0.25% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 1.50% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.50% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.50% per annum.
The Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. In addition, the Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.00 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 3, 2018, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.00 to 1.00.
As of February 3, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.
The Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $9 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 3, 2018 that reduced our remaining availability under our Revolving Facility.
Foreign Facilities
In addition to the Revolving Facility, we maintain various revolving and term loan bank facilities to support our operations in Greater China ("Foreign Facilities"). These facilities allow certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars and Chinese yuan.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a new revolving facility with availability totaling $100 million. The obligation to pay principal and interest is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by L Brands, Inc. and the Guarantors. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. During 2017, we borrowed $1 million under this facility. This borrowing, which matures on May 11, 2022, is included within Long-term Debt on the February 3, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
We also maintain various revolving and term loan bank facilities that are guaranteed by L Brands, Inc. with availability totaling $100 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. During 2017, we borrowed $95 million and made payments of $44 million under these facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time during 2017 was $97 million. Current borrowings on these facilities mature between February 6, 2018 and December 18, 2018 and are included within Current Debt on the February 3, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The guarantees of our obligations under the Revolving Facility by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors’ collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Revolving Facility on our ability to make investments and to

(d) Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plan of $269 million which have been reflected under “Other” as the timing of these future payments is not known until an associate leaves the Company or otherwise requests an in-service distribution. Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The “Less Than 1 Year” category includes $12 million of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $60 million is included in the “Other” category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, a liability of $67 million was recorded in 2017 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings. The tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. For additional information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In connection with the disposition of a certain business, we have remaining guarantees of $10 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancellable leases expiring at various dates through 2021. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. We have not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as of February 3, 2018 or January 28, 2017 as we concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable.
In connection with noncancellable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $104 million. We recorded a liability of $3 million and $1 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, which are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Share-Based Compensation
In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  On a prospective basis, this standard requires recognition of the income tax effects of share-based awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are exercised.  These effects were historically recorded in equity on the balance sheet.  As a result, we recognized $13 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based awards in Provision for Income Taxes in the 2017 Consolidated Statement of Income. The standard also requires all tax-related cash flows from share-based awards to be reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows and any cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employee's behalf from withheld shares as financing activities.  The retrospective application of these changes resulted in a $100 million increase in operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows on the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and a $158 million increase in operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows on the 2015 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Further, as allowed by the standard, we will continue to estimate award forfeitures at the time awards are granted and adjust, if necessary, in subsequent periods based on historical experience and expected future forfeiture rates.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016. This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2018. The standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method.
We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the new standard, income from the Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, which has historically been presented as a reduction to General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, will be presented as revenue. Further, our current accounting related to loyalty points earned under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program will change as we will begin to defer revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative stand-alone selling price method. The new standard will also change our accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we will record a cumulative catch-up adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of approximately $28 million primarily relating to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points, net of estimated forfeitures, under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program. In addition, we expect the adoption of this standard to increase Net Sales and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses by approximately $110 million in fiscal 2018 as a result of the classification change for our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to today's treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and record an increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, Leases, which requires companies classified as lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting. The new standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. The standard currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach. In January 2018, the FASB issued an exposure draft that would provide companies an option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption. The standard is effective beginning in fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impacts that this standard will have on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows. We currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption of the standard. Thus, we expect adoption will result in a material increase to the assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Hedging Activities
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The new standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.
Impact of Inflation
While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.
Inventories
Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.
We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.
We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.
Management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $4 million for 2017. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million for 2017.
Valuation of Long-lived Assets
Property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. First, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill, through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, we recognize an impairment

charge equal to the difference. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Our reporting units that have goodwill are Victoria's Secret Stores, Victoria's Secret Direct, Bath & Body Works Stores and Greater China.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset, compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge, if any.
We estimate the fair value of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.
Claims and Contingencies
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future.
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.
We follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Revenue Recognition
Company-owned Stores and Direct Channels
While our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment, revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization. We recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise. We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. For direct channel revenues, we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times.
All of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores, through our direct channels and through third parties. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same time period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Royalty and Other
We also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license and wholesale arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
For additional information regarding future impacts as a result of our adoption of ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, refer to "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us. We believe that our brands, which lead their categories and offer high emotional content to customers at accessible prices, are well positioned heading into 2018.

NOTE 25. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spin-Off of Delphi Technologies On December 4, 2017, the Company completed the Separation of its former Powertrain Systems segment by distributing to Aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ("Delphi Technologies"), a public limited company formed to hold the spun-off business. To effect the Separation, the Company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies for every three Aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of November 22, 2017, the record date for the distribution. Shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies. Following the Separation, Delphi Technologies is now an independent public company. Aptiv did not retain any equity or other interests in Delphi Technologies. On December 4, 2017, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company transferred to Delphi Technologies the assets and liabilities that comprised Delphi Technologies' business. The Company received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies in connection with the Separation. Delphi Technologies financed this dividend through the issuance of approximately $1.55 billion of debt, consisting of a senior secured five-year $750 million term loan facility that was issued upon the spin-off and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 that were issued in September 2017 (collectively, the "Delphi Technologies Debt"). In connection with the Separation, the Delphi Technologies Debt was transferred to Delphi Technologies and is no longer reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also in connection with the Separation, the Company received $180 million in cash from Delphi Technologies pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement.
