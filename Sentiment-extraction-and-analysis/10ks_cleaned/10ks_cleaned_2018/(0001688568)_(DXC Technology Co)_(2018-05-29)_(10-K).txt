ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Introduction

The purpose of the MD&A is to present information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and our financial condition as of March 31, 2018. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and notes.

The MD&A is organized in the following sections:

- ----------
• Background

- ---------------------
• Results of Operations

- -------------------------------
• Liquidity and Capital Resources

- ------------------------------
• Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

- -----------------------
• Contractual Obligations

- ------------------------------------------
• Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Background

DXC was formed by the combination of CSC and HPES on April 1, 2017. We are the world's leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, serving nearly 6,000 private and public-sector clients from a diverse array of industries across 70 countries. Our technology independence, global talent and extensive partner network deliver transformative digital offerings and solutions that help clients harness the power of innovation to thrive on change.

We generate revenue by offering a wide range of information technology services and solutions primarily in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We operate through three segments: GBS, GIS and USPS. We market and sell our services directly to clients through our direct sales force operating out of sales offices around the world. Our clients include commercial businesses of many sizes and in many industries and public sector enterprises.

Results of Operations

In connection with the HPES Merger, CSC was deemed the accounting acquirer of HPES for accounting purposes under GAAP, therefore, CSC is considered DXC's predecessor and the historical financial statements of CSC prior to April 1, 2017, are reflected herein as DXC's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of DXC as of and for any periods ending prior to April 1, 2017 do not include the financial results of HPES, and therefore, are not directly comparable. Additionally, CSC used to report its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprises four thirteen-week quarters. However, effective April 1, 2017, DXC's fiscal year was modified to end on March 31 of each year with each quarter ending on the last calendar day.

In an effort to provide investors with additional information, the following discussion includes certain comparisons of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 to our pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Our pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 are based upon the historical statements of operations of each of CSC and HPES, giving effect to the HPES Merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016. CSC reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteen-week quarters. HPES reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended October 31. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, all references to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations include the results of operations of CSC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and of HPES for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations" below for additional information.

Fiscal 2018 Highlights

During fiscal 2018, we surpassed our first year HPES Merger integration milestones, delivering over $1 billion of year one cost take-out. The additional savings were primarily driven by workforce optimization actions including the acceleration of management reductions and the global deployment of our automation program, Bionix. These ongoing cost actions address both internal labor, as well as third party contractors. We further enhanced our workforce management processes to cost-effectively deliver existing business while staffing the required labor for new business. We also executed on several initiatives to optimize non-labor spend, including ongoing rate negotiations, vendor consolidation, demand management, reductions in maintenance expense and rationalization of facilities.

Fiscal 2018 financial highlights include the following:

- ------------------------------------------
• Fiscal 2018 revenues were $24,556 million.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fiscal 2018 net income and diluted EPS were $1,782 million and $6.04, respectively, including the cumulative impact of certain items of $550 million, or $1.90 per share, reflecting restructuring costs, transaction, separation and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefit ("OPEB") actuarial and settlement gains and a tax adjustment related to U.S. tax reform.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our cash and cash equivalents were $2,648 million at March 31, 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• We generated $3,243 million of cash from operations during fiscal 2018.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company returned $311 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2018.

Revenues

The following discussion includes a comparison of our revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The discussion of revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 contains an analysis on a GAAP basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the HPES Merger. The discussion of revenues for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 contains an analysis on a GAAP basis only and does not include revenues of HPES.

(NM) Calculation is not meaningful.

The increase in revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by the HPES Merger.

As a global company, over 56% of our fiscal 2018 revenues were earned internationally. As a result, the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period is impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency revenues are a non-GAAP measure calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rates. This information is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends. The table below summarizes our constant currency revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to pro forma revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017:

-------------- ----------------------------------- ------ ---------------------------- ------ ------ ----- ----------------- - - ------ ------ - ------ ------

USPS 2,823 2,846 (23 ) (0.8)%
Total Revenues $ 24,165 — $ 25,394 $ (1,229 ) (4.8)%

(1) Fiscal 2018 revenues are presented at constant currency and include purchase price accounting adjustments of $(24) million, $(98)
 million and $(8) million for GBS, GIS and USPS, respectively. See Note 2 - "Acquisitions."
(2) Our pro forma results of operations are further discussed below in the section “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of
 Operations."

Our Digital revenue cuts across all three of our reporting segments of GBS, GIS, and USPS, and includes Enterprise, Cloud Applications and Consulting, Cloud, Analytics and Security. Digital revenue grew year-over-year, reflecting our clients’ accelerating shift to Digital. During fiscal 2018, we also formed a new digital business team to jointly develop digital transformations with our clients, leveraging assets from across the company and our partnerships.

Global Business Services

Our GBS segment revenues were $9.3 billion for fiscal 2018, representing an increase of $5.1 billion over fiscal 2017. The revenue growth is attributed to the HPES Merger.

Constant currency revenues were $9.1 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $9.5 billion for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis. The $0.4 billion decrease was primarily driven by $0.9 billion of contracts that concluded or were renewed at a lower rate. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.7 billion increase in revenues from new business as well as the contributions from our recent acquisition of Tribridge. Digital revenues in Enterprise, Cloud Applications and Consulting and Analytics grew year-over-year, offset by declines in traditional Application Services revenues. Enterprise, Cloud Applications and Consulting offerings continue to drive growth through an expanded portfolio of quick start offerings, which allow us to rapidly understand the client environment and develop more impactful large scale transformations.

36

Global Infrastructure Services

Our GIS segment revenues were $12.5 billion for fiscal 2018, representing an increase of $9.0 billion over fiscal 2017. The revenue growth is attributed to the HPES Merger.

Constant currency revenues were $12.2 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $13.0 billion for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis. The $0.8 billion decrease was primarily driven by $1.3 billion of contracts that concluded or were renewed at a lower rate. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.6 billion increase in revenues from new business. Cloud revenue grew year-over-year as clients continue to migrate workloads from legacy infrastructure environments to hybrid cloud environments.

United States Public Sector

We began to report the USPS segment, formerly the HPES U.S. public sector business, in fiscal 2018. The USPS segment provides infrastructure and other services similar to our GIS and GBS segments to all levels of government in the U.S.

Constant currency revenues were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2017 on a pro forma basis. The year-over-year comparison of revenues was impacted by an increase in revenues from new business during fiscal 2018 that was offset by the non-recurrence of a contract reset that resulted in a one-time revenue increase in fiscal 2017.

During fiscal 2018, GBS, GIS and USPS had contract awards of $10.2 billion, $11.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

-------------- ------------------ ----- ------------- ----- ------ ----- ----------------- - - ------ --- ----- ----

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) March 31, 2017 April 1, 2016 Change Percentage Change
GBS $ 4,173 $ 3,637 $ 536 14.7%
GIS 3,434 3,469 (35 ) (1.0)%
Total Revenues $ 7,607 — $ 7,106 $ 501 7.1%

Our fiscal 2017 revenues increased $501 million as compared with fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth in our GBS segment and revenues from our recent acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2017 revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $317 million caused by contracts that concluded or were renewed at lower rates and a $221 million adverse impact of foreign currency movement due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound.

37

The table below summarizes our constant currency revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended April 1, 2016:

-------------- ------------------ ----- ------------- ----- ------ ----- ----------------- - ---- -----

 Fiscal Years Ended
(in millions) March 31, 2017(1) April 1, 2016 Change Percentage Change
GBS $ 4,291 $ 3,637 $ 654 18.0%
GIS 3,537 3,469 68 2.0%
Total Revenues $ 7,828 $ 7,106 $ 722 10.2%

(1) Fiscal 2017 revenues are presented at constant currency. Constant currency revenues is a non-GAAP measure and is
 further described above in the section “Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.”

Global Business Services

The $654 million, or 18.0%, constant currency increase for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in next generation business processing services offerings, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, primarily within our Digital Applications business and our IS&S business where we continue to prioritize the development of our digital capabilities. Digital Applications, our enterprise, cloud applications and consulting business, increased over 38% in constant currency and IS&S increased over 26% in constant currency when compared to prior fiscal year. The increase was largely due to revenues from our recent acquisitions which we continue to integrate into our existing business and new business revenues increased $249 million. These increases were partially offset by a $274 million decrease in revenues from contracts that concluded and a $131 million decline from contracts renewed at lower rates.

Global Infrastructure Services

GIS segment constant currency revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $68 million, or 2.0%, as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $243 million in revenues from new business and an increase in revenues contributed from our recent acquisitions. In addition, we recognized incremental revenues of $43 million under our GIS segment's portion of the IP matters agreement (see Note 3 - "Divestitures"). These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of $335 million from contracts that concluded, $89 million from contracts renewed with scope changes and $23 million due to price-downs. We continued to take actions to mitigate the secular headwinds facing our traditional IT outsourcing business and focus GIS on the next generation digital needs of our clients.

During fiscal 2017, GBS and GIS had contract awards of $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2016 contract awards of $4.3 billion and $4.3 billion.

Costs and Expenses

Our total costs and expenses were as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ------ ---------------------- ----- ---------------- ----- ----- - ------- ----- ------- ---- - ----- - ---- -

 Fiscal Years Ended Percentage of Revenues
(in millions) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017(1) April 1, 2016(1) 2018 2017(1) 2016(1)
Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs) $ 17,944 $ 5,545 $ 5,185 73.0 % 72.9 % 73.0 %

Total costs and expenses $ 22,885 $ 7,781 $ 7,096 93.2 % 102.3 % 99.9 %

(1) Fiscal 2017 and 2016 costs and expenses are for CSC only and therefore are not directly comparable to fiscal 2018 costs and
 expenses.

During fiscal 2018, we took actions to optimize our workforce, extract greater supply chain efficiencies and rationalize our real estate footprint. We reduced our labor base by approximately 13% through a combination of automation, best shoring and pyramid correction. We also rebalanced our skill mix, including the addition of more than 18,000 new employees and the ongoing retraining of the existing workforce. In real estate, we restructured over four million square feet of space during fiscal 2018.

Costs of Services

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs ("COS") was $17.9 billion for fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2017. The increase in COS was driven by the HPES Merger and was partially offset by reduction in costs associated with our labor base and real estate. COS for fiscal 2018 included $192 million of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains associated with our defined benefit pension plans.

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

COS as a percentage of revenues remained consistent year over year. The $360 million increase in COS was largely related to our acquisitions and a $31 million gain on the sale of certain intangible assets in our GIS segment during fiscal 2016 not present in the current fiscal year. This increase was offset by management's ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a year-over-year favorable change of $28 million to pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement losses associated with our defined benefit pension plans. The amount of restructuring charges, net of reversals, excluded from COS was $219 million and $7 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Selling, general and administrative expense excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs ("SG&A") was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017. The increase in SG&A was driven by the HPES Merger. Integration, separation and transaction-related costs were $408 million during fiscal 2018, as compared to $305 million during fiscal 2017.

39

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 2.2% to 16.8% for fiscal 2017 from 14.6% for fiscal 2016. The increase was due to transaction and integration costs of $305 million associated with our recent acquisitions and the HPES Merger, an increase of $16 million in the recognition of pension and OPEB actuarial and pension settlement losses and a non-recurring settlement recovery of $16 million recorded as a reduction of SG&A during fiscal 2016, not present in the current fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by higher revenues. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we recognized $15 million and $(1) million, respectively, of actuarial and pension settlement losses (gains) in SG&A. The amount of restructuring charges, net of adjustments, excluded from SG&A was $19 million and $16 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Depreciation and amortization expense ("D&A") was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.6 billion for fiscal 2017. The increase in D&A was attributed to acquired property and equipment and intangible assets associated with the HPES Merger.

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

D&A as a percentage of revenues decreased less than 1% to 8.5% for fiscal 2017 from 9.3% for fiscal 2016 due to an increase in revenues for the GBS segment and lower D&A within the GIS segment as a result of reduced capital expenditures from contract terminations, as well as a continued focus on capital efficiency. The decrease in the D&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in amortization related to acquisitions, primarily within the GBS segment.

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expense associated with facilities and data center rationalization.

During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 we initiated certain restructuring actions across our segments. The fiscal 2018 restructuring initiatives are intended to reduce our core structure and related operating costs, improve our competitiveness, and facilitate the achievement of acceptable and sustainable profitability following our recent acquisitions and the HPES Merger.

Total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $803 million, $238 million and $23 million, respectively. The net amounts recorded included $13 million, $6 million and $7 million of pension benefit augmentations for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, owed to certain employees under legal or contractual obligations. These augmentations will be paid as part of normal pension distributions over several years.

See Note 19 - "Restructuring Costs" for additional information about our restructuring actions.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Interest expense for fiscal 2018 was $335 million as compared to $117 million in fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in interest expense includes interest expense associated with $5.6 billion of debt acquired in connection with the HPES Merger.

Interest income for fiscal 2018 was $89 million as compared to $35 million in fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in interest income was due to higher cash balances during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year.

40

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

Interest expense for fiscal 2017 was $117 million as compared to $123 million in fiscal 2016. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense was due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 redemption of our 6.50% term notes and lower interest rates on our existing debt.

Interest income for fiscal 2017 was $35 million as compared to $38 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average deposit balances in our money market funds and money market deposit accounts during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Debt Extinguishment Costs

During fiscal 2016, CSC redeemed all outstanding 6.50% term notes due March 2018 at par plus redemption premiums related to a make-whole provision and accrued interest. Debt extinguishment costs of $95 million for fiscal 2016 consists primarily of redemption premiums. There were no debt extinguishment costs recorded in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.

Other Income, Net

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Other income, net consists of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains and losses. The $72 million increase in other income for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to foreign currency gain related to a change in the functional currency of a European holding company.

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

The $1 million year-over-year increase in other income was due to a $7 million year-over-year benefit of favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates used to fair value our foreign currency forward contracts and the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities partially offset by a $6 million gain on sale of certain assets during fiscal 2016 not present in fiscal 2017.

Taxes

Our effective tax rate ("ETR") on income (loss) from continuing operations, before taxes for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was (6.6)%, (42.5)% and (620.0)%, respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 11 - "Income Taxes."

In fiscal 2018, the ETR was primarily impacted by the effects of the Act:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The release of a deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $554 million and 33.2%, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The accrual of the one-time transition tax on estimated unremitted foreign earnings which decreased the income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $361 million and 21.6%, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act, which increased the income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $338 million and 20.3%, respectively.

In fiscal 2017, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A change in the valuation allowance that primarily consists of an aggregate income tax detriment for the increase in the valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.S., Germany and Luxembourg, which decreased the overall income tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $135 million and 78%, respectively. Offset by an aggregate income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances on tax attributes primarily in the U.K., Denmark and Japan, which increased the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $75 million and 43.0%, respectively.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An income tax detriment for transaction costs incurred that are not deductible for tax purposes, which resulted in a decrease to the overall tax benefit and decreased the ETR by $21 million and 12.1%, respectively.

41

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An income tax benefit from excess tax benefits realized from employee share-based payment awards, which resulted in an increase in the overall income tax benefit and increased the ETR by $20 million and 11.3%, respectively.

In fiscal 2016, the ETR was primarily impacted by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The adoption of a new accounting standard on excess tax benefits realized from share options vested or exercised. This increased the overall income tax benefit and the ETR by $23 million and 230%, respectively.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase in the overall valuation allowance primarily due to the Separation related to state net operating losses and state tax credits. This decreased the overall income tax benefit and ETR by $27 million and 270%, respectively.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The release of a liability for uncertain tax positions following the closure of the U.K. tax audit for fiscal 2010 to 2012. This increased the income tax benefit by $58 million and increased the ETR by 580%.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjustments to uncertain tax positions in the U.S. that increased the overall income tax benefit by $24 million and increased the ETR by 240%, respectively.

The IRS is examining CSC's federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2016. With respect to CSC's fiscal 2008 through 2010 federal tax returns, we previously entered into negotiations for a resolution through settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for this audit that resulted in various audit adjustments. We have an agreement in principle with the IRS Office of Appeals as to some but not all of these adjustments. We have agreed to extend the statute of limitations associated with this audit through April 30, 2019. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report with proposed adjustments to CSC's fiscal 2011 through 2013 federal returns. We have filed a protest of certain of these adjustments to the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS is also examining CSC's fiscal 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns. We have not received any adjustments for this cycle. For HPES entities the IRS is examining federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through 2012. In addition, HPE entities have received a Revenue Agent's Report with respect to calendar years 2005 through 2008, and these adjustments were protested to the IRS Office of Appeals. We continue to believe that our tax positions are more-likely-than-not sustainable and that we will ultimately prevail.

In addition, we may settle certain other tax examinations, have lapses in statutes of limitations, or voluntarily settle income tax positions in negotiated settlements for different amounts than we have accrued as uncertain tax positions. We may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts for tax positions that previously met a more-likely-than-not standard if such positions are not upheld. Conversely, we could settle positions by payment with the tax authorities for amounts lower than those that have been accrued or extinguish a position through payment. We believe the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next twelve months may result in a reduction in liability for uncertain tax positions of $36 million to $70 million, excluding interest, penalties, and tax carry-forwards.

Income from Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, primarily reflects the results of operations of CSC's former NPS segment which was divested on November 27, 2015. There were no discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Diluted EPS for fiscal 2018 was $6.04, an increase of $6.92 per share compared with the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to an increase of $1,874 million in net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, partially offset by an increase in weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted EPS attributable to capital restructuring associated with the HPES Merger.

Diluted EPS for fiscal 2018 includes $2.06 per share of restructuring costs, $1.00 per share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, $1.37 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets, $(0.60) per share of pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains, and $(1.94) per share reflecting the estimated non-recurring benefit of the Act.

42

Fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

Diluted EPS from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 decreased $1.38 per share to $(0.88) per share primarily due to $403 million of transaction and integration related costs during fiscal 2017 for the HPES Merger and other acquisitions. In addition, restructuring costs increased $215 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of fiscal 2016 debt extinguishment costs of $95 million.

Total diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 decreased $2.66 per share due to the reasons mentioned above for EPS from continuing operations and the lack of discontinued operations associated with the Separation of NPS during the current fiscal year.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations

In an effort to provide investors with additional information, we are disclosing certain unaudited pro forma financial information of DXC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as supplemental information herein. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of DXC (the “unaudited pro forma statement of operations”) is for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 after giving effect to the HPES Merger. See Note 1 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2 - "Acquisitions" for additional information about the HPES Merger.

CSC reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteen-week quarters. Every fifth year included an additional week in the first quarter to prevent the fiscal year moving from an approximate end of March date. HPES reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended October 31. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, all references to the unaudited pro forma statement of operations include the results of operations of CSC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and of HPES for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017.

The historical combined statement of operations of HPES was “carved-out” from the combined statement of operations of HPE and reflects assumptions and allocations made by HPE. The combined statement of operations of HPES included all revenues and costs directly attributable to HPES and an allocation of expenses related to certain HPE corporate functions. The results of operations in the HPES historical combined statement of operations does not necessarily include all expenses that would have been incurred by HPES had it been a separate, stand-alone entity. Actual costs that may have been incurred if HPES had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, functions outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Consequently, HPES’ historical combined statement of operations does not necessarily reflect what HPES’ results of operations would have been had HPES operated as a stand-alone company during the period presented.

The unaudited pro forma statement of operations has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with CSC considered the accounting acquirer of HPES. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations combines the historical results of CSC and HPES, reflects preliminary purchase accounting adjustments and aligns accounting policies of CSC and HPES. The historical statements of operations have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations to give effect to pro forma events that were (i) directly attributable to the HPES Merger, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) which are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations of DXC. The pro forma results do not reflect the costs of integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of first-year synergies.

The adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations were based upon currently available information and assumptions that management of DXC believes to be reasonable. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the actual results of operations that the combined company would have reported had the HPES Merger been completed on April 2, 2016, and should not be taken as being indicative of DXC’s future consolidated financial results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present non-GAAP financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations and unaudited pro forma statement of operations of DXC. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP or pro forma basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results that DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors supplemental information about the financial performance of DXC exclusive of the impacts of corporate wide strategic decisions. DXC management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS.

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma basis. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.

Non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma basis include:

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP adjustments include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring - reflects costs, net of reversals, related to workforce optimization and real estate charges.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Transaction, separation and integration-related costs - reflects costs related to integration planning, financing, and advisory fees associated with the HPES Merger and other acquisitions and costs related to the separation of USPS.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization of acquired intangible assets - reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses - reflects pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Certain overhead costs - reflects certain fiscal 2017 HPE costs allocated to HPES that are expected to be largely eliminated on a prospective basis.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax adjustment - reflects the estimated non-recurring benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for fiscal 2018 and the application of an approximate 27.5% pro forma tax rate for fiscal 2017, which is the midpoint of prospective targeted effective tax rate range of 25% to 30% and effectively excludes the impact of discrete tax adjustments for that period.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows

As of March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents ("cash") were $2.6 billion, of which $1.0 billion was held outside of the United States. A substantial portion of funds can be returned to the U.S. from funds advanced previously to finance our foreign acquisition initiatives. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and after the mandatory one-time income inclusion (deemed repatriation) of the historically untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, we expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the United States. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and state income tax consequences upon future remittance. Therefore, if additional funds held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the United States, we plan to repatriate these funds. Based on a preliminary analysis, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding taxes, state taxes, and India dividend distribution tax of $99 million as described in Note 11 - "Income Taxes". We have changed our permanent reinvestment assertion on our foreign subsidiaries and will no longer consider current and accumulated earnings for all non-U.S. subsidiaries permanently reinvested, except for current year and future Indian earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.4 billion during fiscal 2018 to $2.6 billion, primarily due to growth in our business The following table summarizes our cash flow activity:

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------- ----- -------------- ----- ------------- ----- ------ - - -----

Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period $ 2,648 $ 1,263 $ 1,178

Operating cash flow

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was $3,243 million as compared to $978 million during fiscal 2017. The increase of $2,265 million was predominately due to an increase in net income of $1,882 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was partially offset by additional deferred tax adjustments to operating activities of $842 million and an increase in the gain on pension and other post-employment benefits of $307 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 increased $176 million as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to an increase in trade payables of $411 million, a decrease in net account receivables of $457 million, $32 million less restructuring charges compared to fiscal 2016 and a cash outflow of $190 million for SEC settlement paid in fiscal 2016 with no comparative outflow for the current year. In addition, payments received from CSRA under the amended IP matters agreement increased $35 million. The increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $189 million increase in payments for transaction and integration-related costs, an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable of $252 million and a $545 million decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash transactions from fiscal 2016.

Investing cash flow

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 decreased $893 million to $33 million. The decrease was predominantly due to net cash provided by acquisitions of $735 million during fiscal 2018, compared with cash paid for acquisitions of $434 million during fiscal 2017. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash payments for outsourcing contract costs of $227 million, software purchases of $71 million and a restricted cash outflow of $67 million primarily related to our Federal Receivables Sales Facility.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 decreased $254 million to $926 million. This decrease was driven by a decline of $120 million spent on acquisitions and a decline in capital expenditures of $150 million.

Financing cash flow

Net cash used by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was $1,890 million, as compared to $93 million during fiscal 2017. The $1,983 million increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in credit facility draws, net of repayments of $868 million, additional payments on capitalized lease obligations of $915 million, additional payments on long-term debt obligations of $1,379 million and $132 million in payments for repurchases of common stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by draws on long-term debt of $462 million and cash proceeds from bond issuance of $989 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $93 million, as compared to cash used of $485 million during fiscal 2016. The decline was due primarily to certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows that did not re-occur during fiscal 2017, including a $350 million repayment of our 2.5% term notes, a $313 million special cash dividend paid as part of the NPS Separation, a $95 million payment for the early extinguishment of debt and payments of $73 million for treasury stock that occurred during fiscal 2016. These declines of cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a $254 million payment of acquired debt from the acquisition of Xchanging and $85 million in net proceeds from the structured sale of our U.K. campus.

Capital Resources

See Note 20 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below and under the subheading "Liquidity."

The following table summarizes out total debt:

-------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ----- -------------- ----- - -----

 As of
(in millions) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017
Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 2,073 $ 738
Long-term debt, net of current maturities 6,306 2,225
Total debt $ 8,379 $ 2,963

The $5.4 billion increase in total debt during fiscal 2018 was attributed primarily to debt assumed in connection with the HPES Merger.

The maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of long-term debt principal for fiscal years subsequent to March 31, 2018 and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under long-term financing and capitalized lease liabilities.

During fiscal 2018, we increased commitments under our revolving credit facility to $3.8 billion from $3.0 billion pre-HPES Merger and completed a senior bond offering in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million due 2021, the proceeds of which were used to retire the outstanding USD term loan due 2021. Additionally, we entered into an unsecured €400 million term loan agreement maturing during May 2018, which was subsequently replaced by long-term debt maturing in fiscal 2020, and we entered into amendments to our existing AUD term loan to increase total borrowings to AUD $275 million. We also issued £250 million of senior notes maturing in 2025. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to make prepayments to term loans maturing in 2022 and fully repay the borrowings under revolving credit facilities.

51

During fiscal 2018, we completed a debt exchange offer whereby $234 million principal amount of the $300 million Senior Notes (the “EDS Notes”) were tendered to DXC in exchange for a like principal amount of DXC notes with identical maturity and interest rate. As of March 31, 2018, DXC held approximately $234 million principal amount of the EDS Notes that were tendered, and which are eliminated upon financial statement consolidation, while the remaining $66 million principal amount of the EDS Notes outstanding were held by public noteholders. Subsequent to the period end, DXC extinguished on May 25, 2018 the $234 million principal amount of EDS Notes that it held in preparation for the USPS Separation and Mergers. The $66 million principal amount of EDS Notes that remain outstanding will remain with the legal entity that is spinning off with the USPS Separation.

We were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. For more information on our debt, see Note 12 - "Debt".

The following table summarizes our capitalization ratios:

(1) Net debt and Net debt-to-total capitalization are non-GAAP measures used by management to assess our ability to service our debts using only our cash and cash equivalents. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing our capital structure in a more comprehensive way compared to gross debt based ratios alone.

The decrease in net debt-to-total capitalization was primarily due to a $4.0 billion increase in net debt and a $11.7 billion increase in equity, which were primarily a result of the HPES Merger.

As of March 31, 2018, our credit ratings were as follows:

Moody's Baa2 Stable P-2
S&P BBB Negative -

Liquidity

We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue to use cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to draw on our multi-currency revolving credit facility or raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans and bonds. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.

52

Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.

The following table summarizes our total liquidity:

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. This program became effective on April 3, 2017 and no end date was established. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 1,537,782 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $137 million.

Dividends

During fiscal 2018 the Board of Directors of DXC declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of $0.72 per share, or approximately $209 million. Future dividends are subject to customary board review and approval prior to declaration.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility, receivables sales arrangements and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note 5 - "Receivables" and Note 20 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements.

If we do not meet the specified service minimums, we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall.
(3) The calculated amount for transition tax is payable over eight years; 8% of net tax liability in each of years 1-5, 15% in year 6, 20% in year 7, and 25% in year 8. This amount has been calculated provisionally under SAB 118 and is subject to change in future periods. See Note 11 - "Income Taxes" for additional information about the transition tax and for the estimated liability related to unrecognized tax benefits, which has been omitted from this table.
(4) Amounts represent scheduled interest payments on long-term debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features.
(5) See Note 13 - "Pension and Other Benefit Plans" for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our Pension and OPEB plans that have been omitted from this table.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them: revenue recognition, income taxes, business combinations, defined benefit plans and valuation of assets. We have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.

Revenue Recognition

Most of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time. However, some arrangements are subject to specific accounting guidance that may require significant estimates, including contracts which include multiple-element deliverables.

Multiple-element arrangements

Many of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers, which may include a combination of services, products or both. As a result, significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the elements specified in a multiple-element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, when considered appropriate, how the total revenues should be allocated among the elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element. If vendor specific objective evidence is not available, allocation of total contract consideration to each element requires estimating the fair value or selling price of each element based on third party evidence or management's best estimate of selling price for the

54

deliverables when third party evidence ("TPE") is not available. TPE is established by considering our competitors' prices for comparable product and service offerings in the market in which we operate. When we conclude that comparable products or services are sold by competitors to similarly situated customers, we consult available information sources such as published list prices, quoted market prices and industry reports to estimate TPE. We establish a best estimate of selling price consistent with our existing pricing practices involving a cost-plus-reasonable-margin methodology as well as comparison of the margins to those realized on recent contracts for similar products or services in that market. Once the total revenues have been allocated to the various contract elements, revenues for each element are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered if the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, analyzing our income tax reserves, the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjustment of valuation allowances accordingly. In addition, our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. For example, we are currently undergoing IRS audits for CSC's fiscal 2008 through 2016 U.S. Federal tax returns.

As a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, the extent to which our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, changes in tax regulations, acquisitions, dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income. We cannot predict what our ETR will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors.

As a result of the HPES Merger and changes in U.S. cash requirements, a deferred tax liability of $542 million was recorded for U.S. income taxes based on the estimated historical taxable earnings of the HPES foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we recorded an estimated liability of $50 million for India DDT tax based on estimated historical taxable earnings of the HPES India subsidiary. These liabilities were recorded as part of acquisition accounting.

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), we have changed our ASC 740-30 assertion with respect to the remaining CSC foreign subsidiaries and no longer consider current and accumulated earnings for all non-U.S. subsidiaries permanently reinvested, except for current year Indian earnings. The deferred tax liability relating to HPES foreign subsidiaries of $554 million has been released and our estimated liability for India DDT was increased by $30 million to $80 million to include estimated historical taxable earnings for CSC Indian subsidiaries. For those subsidiaries from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of our change in assertion, we have recorded a provisional estimate for withholding taxes, state taxes, and India DDT of $12 million, $7 million and $80 million, respectively. For those subsidiaries which we were not able to make a reasonable estimate, we have not recorded any deferred taxes. We will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion with respect to these subsidiaries and disclose any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to our foreign subsidiaries, if practicable, in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate, no later than December 2018.

Considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2018 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets. However, valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors.

Changes in tax laws, such as the Act or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations. As discussed in Note 11 - "Income Taxes", for example, the Act provides provisions that limit interest expense, provide for immediate expensing of qualified assets, further limits executive compensation deductions, generally eliminates Federal tax on foreign dividend distributions, subjects certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign

55

related parties to additional taxes, places restrictions or eliminates certain exclusions, deductions and credits and generally broadens the tax base. Further guidance for these provisions is forthcoming and the laws are subject to change in future periods.

The Finance Act of 2012 (the "2012 Finance Act") was signed into law in India on May 28, 2012. The 2012 Finance Act provides for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in India, including on a retroactive basis. The 2012 Finance Act overrides the Vodafone NL ruling by the Supreme Court of India which held that the Indian Tax Authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of non-Indian companies that indirectly own shares in an Indian company. The retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized and challenged in the Indian courts; however, there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful. We have engaged in the purchase of shares of foreign companies that indirectly own shares of an Indian company and internal reorganizations involving Indian companies. The Indian tax authorities may seek to apply the provisions of the 2012 Finance Act to these prior transactions and seek to tax us directly or as a withholding agent or representative assessee of the sellers involved in prior acquisitions. We believe that the 2012 Finance Act does not apply to these prior acquisitions and that we have strong defenses against any claims that might be raised by the Indian tax authorities.

The U.K. Finance (No 2) Act 2017 was passed into law on 16 November 2017, enacting measures deferred from the Finance Act 2017-19. The legislation imposes, with effect from 1 April 2017, restrictions on the utilization of prior period losses against current period profits and limitations on interest deductions. We do not expect there to be a material impact on our financial statements as a result of this legislation.

Business Combinations

We account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.

Defined Benefit Plans

The computation of our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. Inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates. Our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary. The fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Our weighted average rates used were:

-------------------------------------------- -------------- - -------------- --- ------------- --- -

 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 April 1, 2016
Discount rates 2.5 % 3.1 % 3.0 %
Expected long-term rates of return on assets 4.9 % 6.3 % 6.3 %

The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan; judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses. The discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period. The following table provides the

56

impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2018:

---------------------------------------- ------ -------------------------------------------------- --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ------ -

(in millions) Change Approximate Change in Net Periodic Pension Expense Approximate Change in Settlement, Contractual Termination, and Mark-to-Market Charges
Expected long-term return on plan assets 0.5% $ (54 ) $ 57
Expected long-term return on plan assets (0.5)% $ 54 $ (57 )

Discount rate 0.5% $ 12 $ (1,082 )
Discount rate (0.5)% $ (24 ) $ 1,136

Valuation of Assets

We review long-lived ("assets, intangible assets, and goodwill") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts.

Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. The discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business-specific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos.

All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.

Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Revenues

The following discussion includes a comparison of our revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The discussion of revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 contains an analysis on a GAAP basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the HPES Merger. The discussion of revenues for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 contains an analysis on a GAAP basis only and does not include revenues of HPES.

(NM) Calculation is not meaningful.

The increase in revenues for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was driven by the HPES Merger.

As a global company, over 56% of our fiscal 2018 revenues were earned internationally. As a result, the comparison of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar from period to period is impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange is consistent with how management views our revenues and evaluates our operating performance and trends. The table below summarizes our constant currency revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 compared to pro forma revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017:

Liquidity

We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue to use cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to draw on our multi-currency revolving credit facility or raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans and bonds. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.

52

Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.

The following table summarizes our total liquidity:

-------------------------------------------------------- -------------- -----

 As of
(in millions) March 31, 2018
Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,648
Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 3,810
Total liquidity $ 6,458

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. This program became effective on April 3, 2017 and no end date was established. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 1,537,782 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $137 million.

Dividends

During fiscal 2018 the Board of Directors of DXC declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of $0.72 per share, or approximately $209 million. Future dividends are subject to customary board review and approval prior to declaration.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility, receivables sales arrangements and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note 5 - "]:

As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016.

["), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS.

We present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP or pro forma basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP results that DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors supplemental information about the financial performance of DXC of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS.

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma basis. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.

Non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma basis include:

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed.

[") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts.

Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. The discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business-specific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit']:
