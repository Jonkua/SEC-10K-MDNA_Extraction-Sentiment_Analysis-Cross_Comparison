ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 48 manufacturing facilities in 22 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific.
Results of Operations
In 2017, we experienced challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, increased competition and weak demand in many of our key markets. We experienced weakening demand for original equipment and consumer replacement tires in the United States and Europe despite favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment.
In order to continue to drive growth in our business and address the challenging economic environment, we remain focused on our key strategies by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Developing great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Building the value of our brand, helping our customers win in their markets, and becoming consumers’ preferred choice; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service.

In EMEA, we continued to pursue our strategy of focusing on more profitable segments of the market, such as larger rim diameter tires, and closed our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany in July 2017.
During the third quarter of 2017, the United Steelworkers ratified a new five-year master collective bargaining agreement with us in the United States. The new contract, which expires in July 2022, provides increased stability by changing from a four-year to a five-year agreement, operational improvements that increase manufacturing flexibility, and health care changes to help manage costs.
On February 8, 2018, we announced our 2018-2020 capital allocation plan that provides for growth capital expenditures of $700 million to $900 million, debt repayments of $400 million to $600 million, restructuring payments of approximately $400 million and, subject to our performance, common stock dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. We also announced a 40% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.10 per share to $0.14 per share, beginning with the December 1, 2017 payment date. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Overview” for additional information.
Our 2017 results reflect a 4.2% decrease in tire unit shipments compared to 2016. In 2017, we realized approximately $259 million of cost savings, including raw material cost saving measures of approximately $107 million, which exceeded the impact of general inflation. Our raw material costs, including cost saving measures, increased by approximately 16% in 2017 compared to 2016.
Net sales were $15,377 million in 2017, compared to $15,158 million in 2016. Net sales increased in 2017 due to an increase in price and product mix, primarily driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, favorable foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA and Americas, and higher sales in other tire-related businesses, driven by higher prices for third-party chemical sales in Americas. These increases were partially offset by lower tire unit volume, primarily in EMEA and Americas.
Goodyear net income in 2017 was $346 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to $1,264 million, or $4.74 per diluted share, in 2016. The decrease in Goodyear net income in 2017 was driven by an increase in income tax expense, primarily due to the recognition of a net discrete tax charge of $299 million in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law compared to the recognition of discrete tax benefits of $458 million in 2016, primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, and lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and EMEA. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes. Partially offsetting these items were a decrease in rationalization charges and lower corporate selling, administrative and general expense ("SAG"), primarily due to lower incentive compensation.
Our total segment operating income for 2017 was $1,522 million, compared to $1,985 million in 2016. The $463 million, or 23.3%, decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs of $618 million, which more than offset the effect of higher price and product mix of $420 million, lower tire unit volume of $166 million, and higher conversion costs of $139 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes. These impacts were partially offset by lower SAG of $75 million, driven by lower advertising costs, savings from rationalization plans and lower incentive compensation. Refer to "Results of Operations — Segment Information” for additional information.

Liquidity
At December 31, 2017, we had $1,043 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $3,196 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1,132 million and $2,970 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $89 million from December 31, 2016 due primarily to capital expenditures of $881 million, common stock repurchases of $400 million, and dividends paid on our common stock of $110 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of $1,158 million and net borrowings of $129 million. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.
Outlook
We expect that our full-year tire unit volume for 2018 will be up approximately 3.0% compared to 2017, and for unabsorbed fixed overhead costs to be approximately $60 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the anticipated volume increases. We also expect cost savings to more than offset general inflation in 2018 by approximately $130 million. Based on current spot rates, we expect foreign currency translation to positively affect segment operating income by approximately $15 million in 2018 compared to 2017.
Based on current raw material spot prices, for the full year of 2018, we expect our raw material costs will be about flat compared to 2017, excluding raw material cost saving measures, and we expect a benefit of approximately $25 million from price and product mix net of raw material costs. Natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices historically have experienced significant volatility, and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials. We are continuing to focus on price and product mix, to substitute lower cost materials where possible, to work to identify additional substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of material required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw materials.
Given our significant deferred tax assets, we previously had not expected to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through 2020.  With the change in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform, we now do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through 2025.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONSOLIDATED
All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income (loss).
2017 Compared to 2016
Goodyear net income in 2017 was $346 million, or $1.37 per share, compared to $1,264 million, or $4.74 per share, in 2016. The decrease in Goodyear net income in 2017 was driven by an increase in income tax expense, primarily due to recognition of discrete tax charges in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law compared to the recognition of discrete tax benefits in 2016, primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, and lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and EMEA. These items were partially offset by a decrease in rationalization charges and lower corporate SAG, primarily due to lower incentive compensation.
Net Sales
Net sales in 2017 of $15,377 million increased $219 million, or 1.4%, compared to $15,158 million in 2016 due to an increase in price and product mix of $521 million, primarily driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, favorable foreign currency translation of $178 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, and higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $89 million, driven by higher prices for third-party chemical sales in Americas. These increases were partially offset by lower tire unit volume of $569 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. Goodyear worldwide tire unit net sales were $12,958 million and $12,832 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales, which are included in worldwide tire unit net sales, were $9,285 million and $2,928 million, respectively, in 2017. Consumer and commercial net sales were $9,414 million and $2,806 million, respectively, in 2016.
The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated:

----------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ----- -------- ----- --

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions of tires) 2017 2016 % Change
Replacement Units
United States 38.3 39.2 (2.3 )%
International 75.2 78.1 (3.7 )%
Total 113.5 117.3 (3.3 )%
OE Units
United States 13.7 15.7 (12.7 )%
International 32.0 33.1 (3.3 )%
Total 45.7 48.8 (6.4 )%
Goodyear worldwide tire units 159.2 166.1 (4.2 )%

The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 6.9 million units, or 4.2%, compared to 2016, included a decrease of 3.8 million replacement tire units, or 3.3%, comprised primarily of decreases in EMEA and Americas. OE tire units decreased 3.1 million units, or 6.4%, comprised primarily of decreases in Americas and EMEA. The overall volume decreases in EMEA and Americas were primarily related to lower consumer tire sales, driven by increased competition and changes in OEM production. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2017 were 145.9 million and 11.5 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2016 were 153.0 million and 11.6 million, respectively.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold (“CGS”) was $11,719 million in 2017, increasing $747 million, or 6.8%, from $10,972 million in 2016. CGS was 76.2% of sales in 2017 compared to 72.4% of sales in 2016. CGS in 2017 increased due to higher raw material costs of $618 million, foreign currency translation of $141 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, higher conversion costs of $139 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes in Americas and EMEA, higher costs in other tire-related businesses of $107 million, driven by an increase in raw material prices related to third-party chemical sales in Americas, and higher costs related to product mix of $101 million. These increases were partially offset by lower volume of $403 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. CGS in 2017 also included pension expense of $49 million which increased from $44 million in 2016, primarily in Americas. Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in CGS of $8 million ($5 million after-tax and minority) and $16 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
CGS in 2017 included accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million ($28 million after-tax and minority), primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany. Accelerated depreciation was $20 million ($20 million after-tax and minority) in 2016, primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and our plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility.

Selling, Administrative and General Expense
SAG was $2,302 million in 2017, decreasing $105 million, or 4.4%, from $2,407 million in 2016. SAG was 15.0% of sales in 2017 compared to 15.9% of sales in 2016. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and benefits of $105 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans, and lower advertising costs of $49 million. These decreases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of $27 million, primarily in EMEA, and increases due to general inflation. SAG in 2017 included pension expense of $37 million which increased compared to $31 million in 2016, primarily in Americas. Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in SAG of $11 million ($7 million after-tax and minority) and $1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Rationalizations
We recorded net rationalization charges of $135 million ($93 million after-tax and minority) in 2017. Net rationalization charges include charges of $46 million related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount in EMEA, $35 million related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $32 million related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, and $20 million related to SAG headcount reductions in EMEA.
We recorded net rationalization charges of $210 million ($198 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net rationalization charges included charges of $116 million related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $34 million related to a global plan to reduce SAG headcount, and $25 million related to manufacturing headcount reductions in EMEA.
Upon completion of the 2017 plans, we estimate that annual segment operating income will improve by approximately $56 million ($37 million SAG and $19 million CGS), primarily related to our global plans to reduce SAG headcount. The savings realized in 2017 from rationalization plans totaled $91 million ($49 million CGS and $42 million SAG).
For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $335 million in 2017, decreasing $37 million from $372 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate to 5.58% in 2017 compared to 6.23% in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances of $6,001 million in 2017 compared to $5,972 million in 2016. Interest expense in 2017 and 2016 included $6 million ($4 million after-tax and minority) and $12 million ($8 million after-tax and minority), respectively, of expense related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to the redemption of various debt instruments.
Other (Income) Expense
Other (Income) Expense in 2017 was expense of $8 million, increasing $18 million from income of $10 million in 2016. The increase in Other (Income) Expense was primarily due to lower gains on general and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products of $27 million and lower gains on asset sales of $17 million. These increases were partially offset by lower financing fees and financial instruments expense of $28 million.
General and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products in 2017 includes a benefit of $5 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers, as compared to a benefit in 2016 of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers and a benefit of $10 million related to changes in assumptions for probable insurance recoveries for asbestos claims in future periods.
Net (gains) losses on asset sales was a gain of $14 million ($13 million after-tax and minority) in 2017 as compared to a gain of $31 million ($26 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net gains (losses) on asset sales in 2017 included a gain of $6 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Net gains (losses) on asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of the former wire plant site and a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company.
Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2017 includes a premium of $25 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022, as compared to premiums of $53 million ($37 million after-tax and minority) in 2016 related to the redemption of our $900 million 6.5% senior notes due 2021 and our €250 million 6.75% senior notes due 2019.
Other (Income) Expense in 2017 included charges of $14 million ($11 million after-tax and minority) for hurricane related expenses.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense in 2017 was $513 million on income before income taxes of $878 million. In 2017, tax expense was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of $294 million due primarily to a net tax charge of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") on December 22, 2017 in the United States.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21%, replacing the current 35% rate, and creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which generally eliminates the U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The transition to the territorial system includes a one-time transition tax on certain of our foreign earnings previously untaxed in the United States. While our accounting for the Tax Act is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for certain provisions and we have recorded a non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to its enactment. This net charge includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Tax Act. The net charge also includes a provisional deferred tax benefit of $162 million to reverse reserves maintained for the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under prior law net of reserves established for foreign withholding taxes consistent with our revised indefinite reinvestment assertion, and a provisional deferred tax charge of $77 million related to the one-time transition tax.
For 2016, the income tax benefit was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. The net tax benefit in 2016 was driven by net discrete adjustments of $458 million ($459 million after minority interest), due primarily to a tax benefit of $331 million from the December 31, 2016 release of the valuation allowances on certain subsidiaries in England, France, Luxembourg and New Zealand. The release of the valuation allowances on these subsidiaries is net of 2016 tax law changes that reduced deferred tax assets by $23 million. The 2016 income tax benefit also included a $163 million tax benefit resulting from changing our election for our 2009, 2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from deducting foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes. The 2016 income tax benefit was net of a $39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations.
At December 31, 2017, our valuation allowance on certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local deferred tax assets was $88 million primarily related to our investment in our deconsolidated subsidiary in Venezuela, and our valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $230 million. Based on positive evidence and future sources of income it is more likely than not that our foreign tax credits of approximately $750 million will be fully utilized.
Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting period we assess available positive and negative evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. If recent positive evidence provided by the profitability in our Brazilian subsidiary continues, it will provide us the opportunity to apply greater significance to our forecasts in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We believe it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of its valuation allowance will exist within the next twelve months. This may result in a reduction of the valuation allowance and one-time tax benefit of up to $30 million.
For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.
Minority Shareholders’ Net Income
Minority shareholders’ net income was $19 million in 2017, compared to $20 million in 2016.
2016 Compared to 2015
Goodyear net income in 2016 was $1,264 million, or $4.74 per share, compared to $307 million, or $1.12 per share, in 2015. The increase in Goodyear net income in 2016 was primarily driven by recognition of a loss in 2015 related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, a decrease in income tax expense in 2016, primarily due to the recognition of various discrete tax benefits including the release of certain valuation allowances, and a decrease in pension curtailment/settlement expense. Partially offsetting these items were a reduction in royalty income of $155 million that was recognized in 2015 due to the termination of a licensing agreement associated with the sale of our former Engineered Products business and an increase in rationalization charges in 2016, primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany.
Net Sales
Net sales in 2016 of $15,158 million decreased $1,285 million, or 7.8%, compared to $16,443 million in 2015 due primarily to lower sales of $531 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $258 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, a decline in price and product mix of $230 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing, lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $188 million, primarily related to motorcycle tire sales in Americas due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and lower tire unit

volume of $75 million. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2016 were $9,414 million and $2,806 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2015 were $9,907 million and $3,342 million, respectively.
The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated:

----------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ----- -------- ---- --

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions of tires) 2016 2015 % Change
Replacement Units
United States 39.2 39.9 (1.8 )%
International 78.1 75.6 3.3 %
Total 117.3 115.5 1.6 %

International 33.1 34.5 (4.1 )%
Total 48.8 50.7 (3.7 )%
Goodyear worldwide tire units 166.1 166.2 (0.1 )%

The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 0.1 million units, or 0.1%, compared to 2015, included a decrease of 1.9 million OE tire units, or 3.7%, comprised primarily of decreases in Americas, partially offset by increases in Asia Pacific. Replacement tire units increased 1.8 million units, or 1.6%, comprised primarily of increases in Asia Pacific, partially offset by decreases in Americas. The volume increases in Asia Pacific were primarily related to replacement units in Japan due to the acquisition of NGY and growth in China and India in both OE and replacement. The volume decreases in Americas were primarily related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, lower consumer tire sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2016 were 153.0 million and 11.6 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2015 were 152.4 million and 12.4 million, respectively.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $10,972 million in 2016, decreasing $1,192 million, or 9.8%, from $12,164 million in 2015. CGS was 72.4% of sales in 2016 compared to 74.0% of sales in 2015. CGS in 2016 decreased due to lower costs of $373 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, lower raw material costs of $346 million, foreign currency translation of $201 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, lower costs in other tire-related businesses of $127 million, primarily related to motorcycle tire sales in Americas due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and lower volume of $51 million. CGS in 2016 included an out of period adjustment of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit in Americas, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012. CGS in 2016 also included pension expense of $44 million which decreased from $85 million in 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and the change in calculating interest and service costs in the measurement of pension expense effective January 1, 2016. Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in CGS of $16 million ($16 million after-tax and minority) and $91 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
CGS in 2016 included accelerated depreciation of $20 million ($20 million after-tax and minority), primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and our plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility. Accelerated depreciation was $8 million ($7 million after-tax and minority) in 2015, primarily related to our plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility.
Selling, Administrative and General Expense
SAG was $2,407 million in 2016, decreasing $207 million, or 7.9%, from $2,614 million in 2015. SAG was 15.9% of sales in both 2016 and 2015. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and benefits of $66 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans, lower pension settlement charges of $49 million related to a settlement that occurred in 2015, lower costs of $39 million due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, foreign currency translation of $27 million, primarily in EMEA, and lower advertising costs of $12 million. SAG in 2016 included pension expense of $31 million which decreased compared to $50 million in 2015, primarily due to the change in calculating interest and service costs in the measurement of pension expense effective January 1, 2016. Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in SAG of $1 million ($1 million after-tax and minority) and $49 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Rationalizations
We recorded net rationalization charges of $210 million in 2016 ($198 million after-tax and minority). Net rationalization charges included charges of $116 million related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $34 million related to a plan to reduce global SAG headcount, and $25 million related to manufacturing headcount reductions in EMEA.
We recorded net rationalization charges of $114 million in 2015 ($85 million after-tax and minority). Net rationalization charges included charges of $38 million related to the plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility and a plan to transfer consumer tire production from our manufacturing facility in Wittlich, Germany to other manufacturing facilities in EMEA. We also initiated plans in 2015 for manufacturing and SAG headcount reductions in EMEA and Americas.
For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $372 million in 2016, decreasing $66 million from $438 million in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to lower average debt balances of $5,972 million in 2016 compared to $6,053 million in 2015, and a decrease in average interest rates to 6.23% in 2016 compared to 7.22% in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 and 2015 included $12 million ($8 million after-tax and minority) and $16 million ($10 million after-tax and minority), respectively, of expense related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to the redemption of various debt instruments.
Other Income
Other Income in 2016 was $10 million, decreasing $131 million from Other Income of $141 million in 2015. The decrease in Other Income was due, in part, to 2016 royalty income of $23 million, which decreased $169 million from $192 million of royalty income in 2015. Royalty income in 2015 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $155 million ($99 million after-tax and minority) on the recognition of deferred royalty income resulting from the termination of a licensing agreement associated with the sale of our former Engineered Products business.
Other Income in 2016 included net gains on asset sales of $31 million ($26 million after-tax and minority) compared to net gains on asset sales of $71 million ($60 million after-tax and minority) in 2015. Net gains on asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg and a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company. Net gains on asset sales in 2015 included a net gain of $48 million ($38 million after-tax and minority) related to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI and a gain of $30 million ($32 million after-tax and minority) on the sale of our investment in shares of SRI. Net gains on asset sales in 2015 also included losses of $14 million in EMEA, primarily related to the sales of certain sub-Saharan Africa retail businesses.
Other Income included net foreign currency exchange gains of $13 million in 2016, an improvement of $90 million from net foreign currency exchange losses of $77 million in 2015. Foreign currency exchange reflects net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide, including $34 million of losses in 2015 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar.
Other Income in 2016 included charges of $53 million ($37 million after-tax and minority) for premiums related to the redemption of various debt instruments and $10 million ($6 million after-tax and minority) for legal claims unrelated to operations. Other Income in 2016 also included gains of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from several of our asbestos insurers. Other Income in 2015 included charges of $4 million ($4 million after-tax and minority) for labor claims related to a previously closed facility in Greece.

Income Taxes
Income tax benefit in 2016 was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. For 2015, income tax expense was $232 million on income before income taxes of $608 million. The decrease in income taxes for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to net discrete adjustments of $458 Luxembourg and New Zealand. The release of the valuation allowances on these subsidiaries is net of 2016 tax law changes that reduced deferred tax assets by $23 million. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence that could affect our view of realization of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016, these subsidiaries, on which we have previously maintained a full valuation allowance, were located in jurisdictions with unlimited carryforward periods for utilization of tax losses and have achieved earnings of a duration and magnitude that they were in a position of cumulative profits for the most recent three-year period. As a consequence of this profitability in recent periods and our future business plans forecasting sustainable profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in these entities will be realized. The 2016 income tax benefit included a $163 million tax benefit resulting from changing our election for our 2009, 2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from

deducting foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes. Since making our initial election to deduct foreign taxes paid, as opposed to taking them as a credit, the profitability of our U.S. operations has significantly improved. In 2014, as a consequence of our U.S. operations being in a position of cumulative profits for the most recent three-year period, we released our U.S. valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including our foreign tax credits. Our U.S. profitability has continued and the Company forecasts sufficient income of the appropriate character that will allow us to fully utilize these additional foreign tax credits before expiration. Based on these facts, we elected to claim a credit instead of deducting these foreign taxes in 2016. The 2016 income tax benefit included a $39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations. These receivables were written off in the fourth quarter of 2015 when Venezuela was deconsolidated and the Company, at that time, recorded deferred tax assets for a potential bad debt deduction in the U.S. During the third quarter of 2016, these receivables were contributed to Venezuela’s capital, necessitating the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets due to uncertainty as to whether we will be able to generate sufficient future capital gains to fully realize the deduction that is now characterized as a potential capital loss. The 2016 income tax benefit also included a $7 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance in Brazil due to the collection of a receivable that had previously been written off as uncollectible.
Income tax expense for 2015 included discrete net tax benefits of $18 million ($18 million after minority interest), due primarily to a $9 million benefit from the conclusion of non-U.S. tax claims and an $8 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to U.S. state deferred tax assets.
In 2015, in addition to the items noted above, the difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to certain of our foreign subsidiaries continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against their net deferred tax assets, the realization of $55 million of U.S. tax credits primarily as a result of dividend inclusions from Brazil and U.S. legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $69 million of tax benefits related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary.
At December 31, 2016, our valuation allowance on certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local deferred tax assets was $139 million primarily related to our investment in our deconsolidated subsidiary in Venezuela, and our valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $187 million. As discussed above, during 2016 foreign tax credits increased due to a change in election.
For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.
Minority Shareholders’ Net Income
Minority shareholders’ net income was $20 million in 2016, compared to $69 million in 2015. Minority shareholders' net income no longer includes the minority interests of Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. ("GDTNA") and Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. ("GDTE") following the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI on October 1, 2015.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — SEGMENT INFORMATION
Segment information reflects our strategic business units (“SBUs”), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis.
Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items.
Total segment operating income was $1,522 million in 2017, $1,985 million in 2016 and $2,020 million in 2015. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2017 was 9.9%, compared to 13.1% in 2016 and 12.3% in 2015.
Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs’ segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income before Income Taxes.

Operating Income 825 1,151 1,266
Operating Margin 10.0 % 14.1 % 13.5 %

2017 Compared to 2016
Americas unit sales in 2017 decreased 3.2 million units, or 4.4%, to 70.9 million units. OE tire volume decreased 1.7 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in consumer OE in the United States, driven by changes in OEM production. Replacement tire volume decreased 1.5 million units, or 2.8%, primarily in consumer replacement in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Declines in consumer replacement volumes in the United States were primarily driven by increased competition and lower volumes in 16 inch and below rim size tires.
Net sales in 2017 were $8,212 million, increasing $40 million, or 0.5%, compared to $8,172 million in 2016. The increase in net sales was driven by improvements in price and product mix of $168 million, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $104 million, primarily driven by an increase in price for third-party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, primarily in Brazil. These increases in net sales were partially offset by lower tire volume of $281 million.
Operating income in 2017 was $825 million, decreasing $326 million, or 28.3%, from $1,151 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was due to increased raw material costs of $266 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $131 million, unfavorable conversion costs of $108 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes, lower tire unit volume of $79 million, and incremental start-up costs of $28 million associated with our new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by the impact of an out of period adjustment in 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, and lower SAG of $16 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. SAG included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $23 million. During the third quarter of 2017, several Company facilities were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which negatively impacted Americas operating income by about $6 million in 2017.
Operating income in 2017 excluded rationalization charges of $6 million and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of $4 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $1 million.

Americas' results are highly dependent upon the United States, which accounted for approximately 81% and 82% of Americas' net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Results of operations in the United States are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Americas' future performance.
2016 Compared to 2015
Americas unit sales in 2016 decreased 5.0 million units, or 6.3%, to 74.1 million units. Americas unit volume decreased 1.4 million units due to the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and 0.9 million units due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI. OE tire volume decreased 2.6 million units, or 12.1%, primarily driven by the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, continuing weakness in Brazil, lower sales in Canada and a decline in commercial tire volume in the United States. Replacement tire volume decreased 2.4 million units, or 4.1%, primarily due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and lower consumer sales in the United States and Canada. Declines in consumer volume related to sales of 16 inch and below rim size tires in the U.S. and Canada were partially offset by increases in volume related to sales of 17 inch and above rim size tires.
Net sales in 2016 were $8,172 million, decreasing $1,198 million, or 12.8%, compared to $9,370 million in 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $531 million, lower volume of $317 million, lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $169 million, primarily driven by a $113 million decrease in motorcycle tire sales due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI and $45 million related to our retail and retread businesses, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $102 million, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, and a decline in price and product mix of $78 million, primarily driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing.
Operating income in 2016 was $1,151 million, decreasing $115 million, or 9.1%, from $1,266 million in 2015. The decrease in operating income was due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $119 million, lower volume of $84 million, lower income in other tire-related businesses of $57 million, primarily due to decreased motorcycle tire sales as a result of the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI and reduced margins in our commercial retail business, and unfavorable conversion costs of $46 million primarily due to lower production volume and general inflation. Operating income was also negatively impacted by an out of period adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, lower price and product mix of $18 million and incremental start-up costs of $14 million associated with our new plant being constructed in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by lower raw material costs of $189 million and lower SAG of $70 million, primarily due to a decrease in wages and other benefits, including incentive compensation. Conversion costs and SAG included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $1 million and $19 million, respectively.
Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of $4 million and accelerated depreciation of $1 million. Operating income in 2015 excluded net pension settlement charges of $137 million, rationalization charges of $15 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million.

2017 Compared to 2016
Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2017 decreased 4.0 million units, or 6.5%, to 57.1 million units. Replacement tire volume decreased 2.4 million units, or 5.5%, primarily in our consumer business caused by decreased industry demand for 16 inch and below rim size tires and increased competition. OE tire volume decreased 1.6 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in our consumer business, driven by 16 inch and below rim size tires, as a result of the continuation of our OE selectivity strategy, increased competition and reduced OEM production due to certain customers managing inventory levels.
Net sales in 2017 were $4,928 million, increasing $48 million, or 1.0%, compared to $4,880 million in 2016. Net sales increased due to improvements in price and product mix of $244 million, due to our increased focus on 17 inch and above rim size tires and the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, and favorable foreign currency translation of $112 million, primarily related to strengthening of the euro. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower tire unit volume of $303 million.

Table of Contents

Operating income in 2017 was $355 million, decreasing $106 million, or 23.0%, compared to $461 million in 2016. Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $229 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $176 million, lower sales volume of $91 million and higher conversion costs of $31 million, primarily related to under-absorbed overhead due to lower production levels. These decreases were partially offset by lower SAG of $59 million, primarily driven by lower advertising costs and lower wages and benefits due to restructuring savings and lower incentive compensation, and favorable foreign currency translation of $9 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro. SAG and conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million and $49 million, respectively.
Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $111 million, primarily related to programs initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2017 also excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million, related to the closure of our plant in Philippsburg, Germany, as well as gains on asset sales of $10 million, driven by the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Operating income in 2016 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million, which primarily related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and programs initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2016 also excluded charges for accelerated depreciation of $19 million, primarily related to our plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility, as well as gains on asset sales of $17 million, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg.
EMEA’s results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 38% of EMEA’s net sales in 2017 and 2016. Results of operations in Germany are expected to continue to have a significant impact on EMEA’s future performance.
2016 Compared to 2015
Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2016 were consistent with 2015 at 61.1 million units. OE tire volume was consistent with the prior year. Replacement tire volume was also consistent with the prior year as increases in sales of 17 inch and above rim size tires were offset by decreases in sales of 16 inch and below rim size tires that were driven by lower industry demand and increased competition.
Net sales in 2016 were $4,880 million, decreasing $235 million, or 4.6%, compared to $5,115 million in 2015. Net sales decreased due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $110 million, primarily related to devaluation of the British pound and the South African rand, unfavorable price and product mix of $107 million, driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing, and lower sales from other tire related business of $19 million, primarily related to our retread business.
Operating income in 2016 was $461 million, increasing $26 million, or 6.0%, compared to $435 million in 2015. Operating income increased primarily due to lower conversion costs of $29 million related to higher production levels in the first half of the year and lower SAG of $17 million, driven by lower incentive compensation and fees for professional services. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the effect of lower price and product mix of $114 million, which more than offset a decline in raw material costs of $110 million, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $8 million and higher pension costs of $6 million. SAG and conversion costs included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $13 million and $10 million, respectively, primarily related to the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility and programs initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA.
Operating income in 2016 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million, which primarily related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and programs initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2016 also excluded charges for accelerated depreciation of $19 million, primarily related to our plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility, as well as gains on asset sales of $17 million, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Operating income in 2015 excluded net rationalization charges of $95 million, primarily related to the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility and one of our Amiens, France manufacturing facilities, and charges for accelerated depreciation of $8 million. Operating income in 2015 also excluded net losses on asset sales of $14 million, primarily related to the sales of certain sub-Saharan Africa retail businesses and charges of $4 million related to labor claims with respect to a previously closed facility in Greece.

Results of operations in China and Australia are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Asia Pacific's future performance.
2016 Compared to 2015
Asia Pacific unit sales in 2016 increased 4.9 million units, or 18.9%, to 30.9 million units. Replacement tire volume increased 4.2 million units, or 28.7%, primarily in the consumer business, due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in NGY in Japan, which increased tire volume by 3.2 million units, and growth in China and India. OE tire volume increased 0.7 million units, or 6.9%, primarily in the consumer business, which reflected growth in China and India.
Net sales in 2016 were $2,106 million, increasing $148 million, or 7.6%, from $1,958 million in 2015. Net sales increased by $239 million due to higher tire volume, including $129 million related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in NGY. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $46 million, primarily related to the strong U.S. dollar against most Asian currencies except the Japanese yen, and lower price and product mix of $45 million, driven primarily by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing.
Operating income in 2016 was $373 million, increasing $54 million, or 16.9%, from $319 million in 2015. Operating income increased due primarily to higher tire volume of $62 million, lower raw material costs of $47 million, which offset the effects of lower price and product mix of $46 million, lower conversion costs of $18 million, due to the favorable impact of higher production levels on absorbed overhead, and an increase of $18 million related to incentives for the expansion of our factory in China. These increases were partially offset by higher SAG of $31 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in NGY, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $10 million.
Operating income in 2016 excluded net gains on asset sales of $1 million and net rationalization charges of $1 million. Operating income in 2015 excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and net rationalization charges of $4 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to:

- ---------------------------------------------------
• general and product liability and other litigation,

- ----------------------
• workers’ compensation,

- ---------------------------
• recoverability of goodwill,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, and

- -------------------------------------------
• pensions and other postretirement benefits.

General and Product Liability and Other Litigation.  We have recorded liabilities totaling $316 million, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for potential product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, at December 31, 2017. General and product liability and other litigation liabilities are recorded based on management’s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts.
In determining the estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next ten year period. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $167 million at December 31, 2017.
We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors.
As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $113 million, and we expect that approximately 70% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, $15 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2017. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage-in-place agreements with certain primary and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers. Although we believe these amounts are collectible under primary and certain excess policies today, future disputes with insurers could result in significant charges to operations.
Workers’ Compensation.  We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $243 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers’ compensation claims at December 31, 2017. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk-free rate of return.
For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers’ compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
Recoverability of Goodwill.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $595 million at December 31, 2017.
We test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting

 33

Table of Contents

unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured.
At October 31, 2017, after considering changes to assumptions used in our most recent quantitative annual testing for each reporting unit, including the capital markets environment, economic conditions, tire industry competition and trends, changes in our results of operations, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our most recent quantitative annual testing, and other factors, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions.  At December 31, 2017, we had valuation allowances aggregating $318 million against certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign net deferred tax assets.
We record a reduction to the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing future profitability and the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in either our financial statements or tax returns.
We consider both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it may be objectively verified. Current and cumulative financial reporting results are a source of objectively verifiable evidence. We give operating results during the most recent three-year period a significant weight in our analysis. We typically only consider forecasts of future profitability when positive cumulative operating results exist in the most recent three-year period. We perform scheduling exercises to determine if sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character exists in the periods required in order to realize our deferred tax assets with limited lives (tax loss carryforwards and tax credits) prior to their expiration. We consider tax planning strategies available to accelerate taxable amounts if required to utilize expiring deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in our judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.
We recognize the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances in the period in which legislation is enacted. We remeasure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tax rates at which they will be realized. We also consider the effects of enacted tax laws in our analysis of the need for valuation allowances. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted in the United States, which establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, replacing the current 35% rate, and creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system. Certain impacts of the new legislation would generally require accounting to be completed in the period of enactment, however in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC issued guidance to provide companies with relief. Specifically, when the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made. The SEC has provided up to a one year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting over the coming quarters. While our accounting for the Tax Act deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts the one-time transition tax.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act subjects a U.S. parent to current tax on its "global intangible low-taxed income" ("GILTI"). We do not anticipate incurring a GILTI liability, however, to the extent that we incur expense under the GILTI provisions we will treat it as a component of income tax expense in the period incurred.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including those for transfer pricing. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize income tax benefits when, based on new information, we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and lead to

recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities, resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. To reduce our risk of an unfavorable transfer price settlement, the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, supports pricing with economic studies and seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, would result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes.
For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions and valuation allowances, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.  We have recorded liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits of $656 million and $282 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including:

- ------------------
• life expectancies,

- -----------------
• retirement rates,

- ---------------
• discount rates,

- -----------------------------------------
• long term rates of return on plan assets,

- ----------------
• inflation rates,

- ---------------------------
• future compensation levels,

- -----------------------------
• future health care costs, and

- --------------------------------------
• maximum company-covered benefit costs.

Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The mortality assumption for our U.S. plans is based on actual historical experience, an assumed long term rate of future improvement based on published actuarial tables, and current government regulations related to lump sum payment factors. The long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based on estimates of future long term rates of return similar to the target allocation of substantially all fixed income securities. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as-needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected.
The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 3.56% and 3.44%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, compared to 3.99% and 3.72%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2017 was due primarily to lower yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $160 million in 2017, compared to $164 million in 2016 and $238 million in 2015. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $13 million in 2017, compared to $12 million in 2016 and $15 million in 2015. 2017 and 2016 interest costs reflect the election to measure interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for plans that utilize a yield curve approach.

The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, and annual expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions:

------------------------------------ -------- --------------------------------- --- -------------- - - -

 + / − Change at December 31, 2017
(Dollars in millions) Change PBO/ABO Annual Expense
Pensions:
Assumption:
Discount rate +/- 0.5% $ 292 $ 4

Other Postretirement Benefits:
Assumption:
Discount rate +/- 0.5% $ 5 $ —
Health care cost trends — total cost +/- 1.0% 1 —

Changes in general interest rates and corporate (AA or better) credit spreads impact our discount rate and thereby our U.S. pension benefit obligation. Our U.S. pension plans are invested in a portfolio of substantially all fixed income securities designed to offset the impact of future discount rate movements on liabilities for these plans. If corporate (AA or better) interest rates increase or decrease in parallel (i.e., across all maturities), the investment portfolio described above is designed to mitigate a substantial portion of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation. For example, if corporate (AA or better) interest rates increased or decreased by 0.50%, the actions described above would be expected to mitigate more than 85% of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation.
At December 31, 2017, our net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to global pension plans was $3,272 million, $2,603 million of which related to our U.S. pension plans. The net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to our U.S. pension plans is a result of declines in U.S. discount rates and plan asset losses that occurred prior to 2015, plus the impact of prior increases in estimated life expectancies. For purposes of determining our 2017 U.S. pension total benefits cost, we recognized $140 million of the net actuarial losses in 2017. We will recognize approximately $114 million of net actuarial losses in 2018 U.S. net periodic pension cost. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2017, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2018 before it begins to gradually decline. In addition, if annual lump sum payments from a pension plan exceed annual service and interest cost for that plan, accelerated recognition of net actuarial losses will be required through a settlement in total benefits cost.
The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 8.7%, 6.9% and (2.1%) in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 5.08%, 5.33% and 5.00% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans.
The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. pension plans is approximately 18 years.
Net periodic pension costs were recorded in CGS, as part of the cost of inventory sold during the period, or SAG in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on the specific roles (i.e., manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) of employee groups covered by each of our pension plans. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 60% and 40% of net periodic pension costs are included in CGS and SAG, respectively. Effective January 1, 2018, non-service related net periodic pension costs will be recorded in Other (Income) Expense in line with the accounting standards update issued by the FASB to improve the financial statement presentation of pension and post retirement benefits cost. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting Policies.
Globally we expect our 2018 net periodic pension cost to be approximately $100 million to $125 million, compared to $88 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates for our U.S. pension plans.
We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2017 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $47 million for our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2017 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining 2017 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $6 million of net actuarial losses in 2017. We will recognize approximately $5 million of net actuarial losses in 2018. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2017, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2018 before it begins to gradually decline.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
OVERVIEW
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital.
On February 8, 2018, we announced our 2018-2020 capital allocation plan that is intended to increase shareholder value by investing in high-return growth capital projects, strengthening our balance sheet and providing for direct returns to shareholders. The capital allocation plan provides for:

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• Growth capital expenditures of $700 million to $900 million.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Debt repayments of $400 million to $600 million, which advances our objective of achieving an investment grade credit rating.

- -----------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring payments of approximately $400 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Common stock dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, subject to our performance.

We announced a 40% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.10 per share to $0.14 per share, beginning with the December 1, 2017 payment date.
In March 2017, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2027. These notes were sold at 100% of the principal amount and will mature on March 15, 2027. These notes are unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our U.S. senior secured credit facilities.
In May 2017, we used the proceeds from the $700 million 4.875% senior notes due 2027, together with cash and cash equivalents, to redeem in full our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022, which included the payment of a $25 million redemption premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. We also recorded $6 million of expense for the write-off of deferred financing fees as a result of the redemption.
For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2017, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview.”
At December 31, 2017, we had $1,043 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents, compared to $1,132 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $89 million was primarily due to cash used for investing activities of $879 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $881 million; cash used for financing activities of $415 million, primarily related to common stock repurchases of $400 million and common stock dividends of $110 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $129 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of $1,158 million, which included net income of $365 million and non-cash depreciation and amortization of $781 million.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had $3,196 million and $2,970 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31:

------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- - -----

(In millions) 2017 2016
First lien revolving credit facility $ 1,667 $ 1,506
European revolving credit facility 659 579
Chinese credit facilities 217 252
Mexican credit facilities — 52
Other domestic and international debt 298 267
Notes payable and overdrafts 355 314
 $ 3,196 $ 2,970

We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.

We expect our 2018 cash flow needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $335 million and $360 million, restructuring payments to be approximately $200 million, dividends on our common stock to be approximately $135 million, and contributions to our funded non-U.S. pension plans to be approximately $25 million to $50 million. We expect working capital to be a use of cash of approximately $100 million in 2018. We intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations.
We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2018 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment.
Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as China and South Africa, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third-party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and/or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and/or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Chinese and South African subsidiaries, which are subject to such requirements or limitations, to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2017, approximately $807 million of net assets, including $103 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to such requirements. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China and South Africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries.
Cash Position
At December 31, 2017, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $355 million or 34% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Belgium ($310 million or 27% at December 31, 2016),

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $344 million or 33% in Asia Pacific, primarily India, China and Australia ($427 million or 38% at December 31, 2016), and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $169 million or 16% in Americas, primarily Canada and Brazil ($203 million or 18% at December 31, 2016).

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,158 million in 2017, compared to $1,557 million in 2016 and $1,728 million in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 decreased $399 million compared to 2016 primarily due to a $463 million decrease in segment operating income.
Cash used for working capital in 2017 was $106 million compared to $117 million in 2016. Cash used for working capital in 2017 reflects the impacts of higher raw materials on our costs and pricing, driving year-over-year increases in cash used for accounts receivable of $358 million and cash provided by accounts payable of $241 million, as the balances of each remaining on our year-end balance sheet are higher compared to the prior year. Cash used for inventory decreased $128 million during 2017 as the impacts of higher raw materials were more than offset by the impact of reduced production levels.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to an increased use of cash for working capital of $75 million and lower segment operating income of $35 million.
The increased use of cash for working capital in 2016 was due to an increase in cash used for accounts payable of $234 million, primarily due to the timing of payments and 2015 payables that were paid in 2016 which reflected higher average raw material prices, and inventories of $83 million, driven by an increase in year-end inventory units for finished goods in 2016. These uses of cash were partially offset by positive year-over-year cash flow from accounts receivable of $242 million, primarily due to increased factoring activity in 2016.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $879 million in 2017, compared to $979 million in 2016 and $1,256 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $881 million in 2017, compared to $996 million in 2016 and $983 million in 2015. Beyond expenditures required to sustain our facilities, capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to the construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United States, Mexico, China and India. Capital expenditures in 2016 primarily related to the

construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United States, Brazil, China and Mexico. Capital expenditures in 2015 primarily related to the construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United States, Brazil, China, Germany and Mexico. Proceeds from asset sales were $12 million in 2017. Proceeds from asset sales were $35 million in 2016, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg and the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company. Proceeds from asset sales were $62 million in 2015, primarily related to the sale of our investment in shares of SRI.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $415 million in 2017, compared to net cash used of $876 million in 2016 and net cash used of $1,026 million in 2015. Financing activities in 2017 included net borrowings of $129 million. Financing activities in 2016 included net debt repayments of $256 million. Financing activities in 2015 included net debt repayments of $477 million and a payment related to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI of $271 million. In 2017, we paid dividends on our common stock of $110 million and repurchased $400 million of our common stock, as compared to dividend payments of $82 million and common stock share repurchases of $500 million in 2016. In 2015, dividend payments were $68 million and common stock share repurchases were $180 million.
Credit Sources
In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $8,963 million available at December 31, 2017, of which $3,196 million were unused, compared to $8,491 million available at December 31, 2016, of which $2,970 million were unused. At December 31, 2017, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $8,346 million, of which $2,841 million were unused, compared to $7,932 million and $2,656 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $617 million, of which $355 million were unused, compared to $559 million and $314 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time.
Outstanding Notes
At December 31, 2017, we had $3,325 million of outstanding notes, compared to $3,287 million at December 31, 2016.
$2.0 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2021
Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based primarily on (i) eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, (ii) the value of our principal trademarks, and (iii) certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $2.0 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2017, our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under the facility was $296 million below the facility's stated amount of $2.0 billion. Based on our current liquidity, amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points.
At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings and $37 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had $85 million of borrowings and $40 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.
During 2016, we began entering into bilateral letter of credit agreements. At December 31, 2017, we had $368 million in letters of credit issued under these agreements.
Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2019
In March 2017, we amended our second lien term loan facility. As a result of the amendment, the term loan now bears interest, at our option, at (i) 200 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 100 basis points over an alternative base rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate plus 50 basis points or (c) LIBOR plus 100 basis points). In addition, if the Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 1.25 to 1.00, we have the option to further reduce the spreads described above by 25 basis points. "Total Leverage Ratio" has the meaning given it in the facility.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amounts outstanding under this facility were $400 million and $399 million, respectively.

€550 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2020
Our amended and restated €550 million European revolving credit facility consists of (i) a €125 million German tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (“GDTG”) and (ii) a €425 million all-borrower tranche that is available to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. ("GDTE"), GDTG and Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations S.A. Up to €150 million of swingline loans and €50 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all-borrower tranche. Amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling and EURIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated in euros, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility.
Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2015 under the first lien facility and December 31, 2014 under the European facility.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet)
GDTE and certain other of our European subsidiaries are parties to a pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides the flexibility to designate annually the maximum amount of funding available under the facility in an amount of not less than €30 million and not more than €450 million. For the period beginning October 16, 2016 to October 15, 2017, the designated maximum amount of the facility was €320 million. Effective October 16, 2017, the designated maximum amount of the facility was reduced to €275 million.
The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries. Utilization under the facility is based on eligible receivable balances.
The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) September 25, 2019, (b) the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our senior secured credit facilities; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our request for early termination of the facility. The facility’s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on October 15, 2018.
At December 31, 2017, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $224 million (€187 million). At December 31, 2016, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $198 million (€188 million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long Term Debt and Capital Leases.
Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet)
We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the gross amount of receivables sold was $572 million and $502 million, respectively.
Supplier Financing
We have entered into payment processing agreements with several financial institutions. Under these agreements, the financial institution acts as our paying agent with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers. These agreements also allow our suppliers to sell their receivables to the financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them. We are not always notified when our suppliers sell receivables under these programs. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers' decisions to sell their receivables under the program. Agreements for such supplier financing programs totaled up to $500 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Covenant Compliance
Our first and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Our first and second lien credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes also have customary defaults, including cross-defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and its subsidiaries.
We have additional financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows:

• We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company (The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company) and guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (“Available Cash”) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $200 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2017, our availability under this facility of $1,667 million plus our Available Cash of $208 million totaled $1,875 million, which is in excess of $200 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to use such cash proceeds to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0.

In addition, our European revolving credit facility contains non-financial covenants similar to the non-financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTE’s ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.
Our credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test.
Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt.
As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures.
The terms “Available Cash,” “EBITDA,” “Consolidated Interest Expense,” “Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness,” “Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio,” “Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness” and “Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA” have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities.
Potential Future Financings
In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions that could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured.
Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining

 41

Table of Contents

assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt.
Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program
Under our primary credit facilities and some of our note indentures, we are permitted to pay dividends on and repurchase our capital stock (which constitute restricted payments) as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities or indentures following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid cash dividends of $110 million, $82 million and $68 million, respectively, on our common stock. On January 16, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) declared cash dividends of $0.14 per share of our common stock, or approximately $34 million in the aggregate. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 1, 2018. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.
On September 18, 2013, the Board of Directors approved our common stock repurchase program. From time to time, the Board of Directors has approved increases in the amount authorized to be purchased under that program. On February 2, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a further increase in that authorization to $2.1 billion. This program expires on December 31, 2019. We intend to repurchase shares of common stock in open market transactions in order to offset new shares issued under equity compensation programs and to provide for additional shareholder returns. During 2017, we repurchased 12,755,547 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $31.37 per share, or $400 million in the aggregate. Since 2013, we repurchased 43,969,657 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $29.87 per share, or $1,313 million in the aggregate.
The restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and indentures did not affect our ability to pay the dividends on or repurchase our capital stock as described above, and are not expected to affect our ability to pay similar dividends or make similar repurchases in the future.
Asset Dispositions
The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non-core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions.

(1) Debt obligations include Notes Payable and Overdrafts, and excludes the impact of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $67 million.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt or future changes in variable interest rates.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $12 million, $8 million, $6 million, $3 million, $2 million and $7 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $38 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,008 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $847 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2017. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the mid-point of the range of our expected contributions for funded U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.

We made significant contributions to fully fund our U.S. pension plans in 2013 and 2014. We have no minimum funding requirements for our funded U.S. pension plans under current ERISA law or the provisions of our USW collective bargaining agreement, which requires us to maintain an annual ERISA funded status for the hourly U.S. pension plan of at least 97%.
Future U.S. pension contributions will be affected by our ability to offset changes in future interest rates with asset returns from our fixed income portfolio, and any changes to ERISA law. For further information on the U.S. pension investment strategy, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.
Future non-U.S. contributions are affected by factors such as:

- ----------------------------
• future interest rate levels,

- -------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of asset returns, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of future contributions.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant

 43

Table of Contents

summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) The payments for workers’ compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers’ compensation is $243 million.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8) Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2017.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters.

Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table.
In addition, pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers' production levels. These contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above.
We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has:

- ----------------
• made guarantees,

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.

We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off-balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $82 million at December 31, 2017. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.
We concluded that effective as of December 31, 2015, we no longer met the accounting criteria for control of our Venezuelan subsidiary, and its assets and liabilities are no longer reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to its deconsolidation, we maintained a variable interest in our Venezuelan subsidiary. Our exposure to future losses resulting from our Venezuelan subsidiary is limited to the extent that we decide to provide raw materials or finished goods to, or make future investments in, our Venezuelan subsidiary. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting Policies.

[") on December 22, 2017 in the United States.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act establishes a corporate is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for certain provisions and we have recorded a non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to its enactment. This net charge includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts the one-time transition tax.
For 2016, the income tax benefit was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. The net tax benefit in 2016 was driven by net discrete adjustments of $458 was net of a $39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations.
At December 31, 2017, our will be fully utilized.
Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain the need for a valuation allowance. We believe it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of its valuation allowance will exist within the next twelve months. This may result in a reduction of the valuation allowance and one-time tax benefit of up to $30 million.

Net Sales
Net sales in 2016 of $15,158 million decreased $1,285 million, or 7.8%, compared to $16,443 million in 2015 due primarily to lower sales of $531 million as primarily in EMEA and Americas, driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing, lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $188 million, primarily related to motorcycle tire sales in Americas due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and lower tire unit

Since making our initial election to deduct foreign taxes paid, as opposed to taking them as a credit, the quarter of 2016, these receivables were contributed to Venezuela’s capital, necessitating the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets due to uncertainty as to whether we will related to the release of a valuation allowance in Brazil due to the collection of a receivable that had previously been written off as uncollectible.
Income tax expense for 2015 included discrete net allowance related to U.S. state deferred tax assets.
In 2015, in addition to the items noted above, the difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to certain inclusions from Brazil and U.S. legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $69 million of tax benefits related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary.
At December 31, 2016, our allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $187 million. As discussed above, during 2016 foreign tax credits increased due to a change in election.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — SEGMENT INFORMATION
Segment information reflects our strategic business units (“SBUs”), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis.
Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items.
Total segment operating income was $1,522 million in 2017, $1,985 million in 2016 and $2,020 million in 2015. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2017 was 9.9%, compared to 13.1% in 2016 and 12.3% in 2015.
Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs’ segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income before Income Taxes.

2017 Compared to 2016
Americas unit sales in 2017 decreased 3.2 million units, or 4.4%, to 70.9 million units. OE tire volume decreased 1.7 million units, or 9.0%, primarily Canada. Declines in consumer replacement volumes in the United States were primarily driven by increased competition and lower volumes in 16 inch and below rim size tires.
Net sales in 2017 were $8,212 of higher raw material costs on pricing, higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $104 million, primarily driven by an increase in price for third-party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, primarily in Brazil. These increases in net sales were partially offset by lower tire volume of $281 million.
Operating income in 2017 was $825 million, decreasing $326 million, or 28.3%, from $1,151 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was due to increased raw material costs of $266 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $131 million, unfavorable conversion costs of $108 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes, lower tire unit volume of $79 million, and incremental start-up costs of $28 million associated with our new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by the impact of an out of period adjustment in 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, and lower SAG of $16 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. SAG included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $23 million. During the third quarter of 2017, several Company facilities were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which negatively impacted Americas operating income by about $6 million in 2017.
Operating income in 2017 excluded rationalization charges of $6 million and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of $4 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $1 million.
