OVERVIEW

Business

eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Our Marketplace platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, its localized counterparts and the StubHub mobile apps. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others.

Seasonality

We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns and expect that these trends will continue. The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

--------------------------------- ------------- ----- ------- - ------------ ----- ----------- -- - ----- - - -----

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, euro, Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the fact that we generated a majority of our net revenues internationally during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we are subject to the risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”

In addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financial results. The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-Neutral information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information provided in “Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performance,” which includes reconciliations of FX-Neutral financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.

The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2017 was due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar, in the first half of the year, against other currencies, primarily the British pound and euro, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the year, against other currencies, primarily the euro.

Fiscal Year Highlights

Net revenues increased 7% to $9.6 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by Marketplace net transaction revenues and Classifieds marketing services and other revenues. FX-Neutral net revenues increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Operating margin decreased to 23.7% in 2017 compared to 25.9% in 2016.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, in the first quarter of 2017, related to the continued realignment of our legal structure, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.

In 2017, we also received a 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment, resulting in a cost method investment of $725 million. The gain on disposal of our eBay India business of $167 million was recorded in interest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

Also in 2017, we issued unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion. In addition, $1.5 billion of previously issued unsecured notes due in 2017 matured and were repaid.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to a loss per share of $0.95 in 2017 compared to earnings per share of $6.37 in 2016. We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to $2.8 billion in 2016.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues

We generate two types of net revenues: net transaction revenues and marketing services and other (“MS&O”) revenues. Net transaction revenues are derived principally from final value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms), listing fees and other service fees. MS&O revenues consists of Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds revenue principally from the sale of advertisements, vehicles classifieds listing on Marketplace platforms, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing service fees and lead referral fees. Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform that displays advertising, other service provider or customer, as the case may be, is located. To drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These incentives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.

The following table presents net revenues by type and geography (in millions, except percentages):

The following table presents certain key operating metrics that we believe are significant factors affecting our net transaction revenues (in millions, except percentages):

------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ -------- ----- ---- - -------- - ------ ----- -- - ----- - - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 % Change 2016 % Change 2015
Supplemental Operating Data:

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) We define Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) We define Marketplace transaction take rate as Marketplace net transaction revenues divided by Marketplace GMV.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) We define StubHub transaction take rate as StubHub net transaction revenues divided by StubHub GMV.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) We define total transaction take rate as total net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

Net Transaction Revenues

The following table presents total net transaction revenues and supplemental operating data (in millions, except percentages):

------------------------------ ----------------------- - -------- ------ ----------------------- ---------- - ---- - ---- ---- ----------- -- ---------- ------ ---- - - - -

 Year Ended December 31, % Change Year Ended December 31, % Change
 2017 2016 As Reported FX-Neutral 2016 2015 As Reported FX-Neutral
Total net transaction revenues 7,460 7,044 6 % 7 % 7,044 6,828 3 % 6 %
Percentage of net revenues 78 % 78 % 78 % 79 %

Total GMV 88,403 83,488 6 % 6 % 83,488 81,304 3 % 5 %
Total transaction take rate 8.44 % 8.44 % — % 8.44 % 8.40 % 0.04 %

The increase in net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Marketplace GMV. Total transaction take rate was flat in 2017 compared to 2016.

The increase in net transaction revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in StubHub GMV and a higher transaction take rate, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The total transaction take rate was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in our StubHub transaction take rate, partially offset by a decrease in our Marketplace transaction take rate.

Net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled $4.0 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing 53%, 54% and 55% of total net transaction revenues in the respective periods. The decrease in net transaction revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by growth in net transaction revenues earned domestically and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in net transaction revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Marketplace Net Transaction Revenues

The following table presents Marketplace net transaction revenues and supplemental operating data (in millions, except percentages):

-------------------------------- ----------------------- - -------- ------ ----------------------- ---------- -- ---- - ---- ---- ----------- ---------- ------ ----- -- - - -

 Year Ended December 31, % Change Year Ended December 31, % Change
 2017 2016 As Reported FX-Neutral 2016 2015 As Reported FX-Neutral
Marketplace transaction revenues 6,450 6,107 6 % 7 % 6,107 6,103 — % 3 %

Marketplace GMV 83,883 79,178 6 % 6 % 79,178 77,729 2 % 5 %
Marketplace take rate 7.69 % 7.71 % (0.02 )% 7.71 % 7.85 % (0.14 )%

The increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to Marketplace GMV growth, partially offset by hedging activity and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Marketplace transaction take rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was relatively flat.

The increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in volume in local currencies on our Marketplace platforms internationally, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace net transaction revenue was less than the increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV due to a lower Marketplace transaction take rate. The Marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a shift in seller mix and an increase in our buyer and seller incentives.

StubHub Net Transaction Revenues

The following table presents StubHub net transaction revenues and supplemental operating data (in millions, except percentages):

---------------------------- ----------------------- - -------- ----- ----------------------- ---------- - ---- - ---- ----- ----------- ---------- ----- ---- -- - -- -

 Year Ended December 31, % Change Year Ended December 31, % Change
 2017 2016 As Reported FX-Neutral 2016 2015 As Reported FX-Neutral
StubHub transaction revenues 1,010 937 8 % 8 % 937 725 29 % 29 %

StubHub GMV 4,520 4,310 5 % 5 % 4,310 3,575 21 % 21 %
StubHub take rate 22.35 % 21.76 % 0.59 % 21.76 % 20.30 % 1.46 %

The increase in StubHub net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in StubHub take rate and StubHub GMV. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to pricing strategies and a decrease in our buyer incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue. The increase in StubHub GMV in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by Theater and Concerts, partially offset by Sports.

The increase in StubHub net transaction revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in Sports, Concerts and Theater transactions on our platform, as well as a higher StubHub transaction take rate. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate was primarily due to a change in mix of events and sellers on the StubHub platforms. The increase in StubHub net transaction revenue was greater than the increase in StubHub GMV due to the higher StubHub transaction take rate.

Marketing Services and Other Revenues

The following table presents marketing services and other (“MS&O”) revenues (in millions, except percentages):

---------------------------- ----------------------- ----- -------- --- ----------------------- ----- ---------- - ---- -- ---- - ----------- -- ---------- ----- - -- ----- -- -- - -- -

 Year Ended December 31, % Change Year Ended December 31, % Change
 2017 2016 As Reported FX-Neutral 2016 2015 As Reported FX-Neutral
MS&O revenues:
Marketplace $ 1,192 $ 1,137 5 % 5 % $ 1,137 $ 1,078 6 % 8 %
Classifieds 897 791 13 % 12 % 791 703 13 % 15 %
StubHub, Corporate and other 18 7 ** ** 7 (17 ) ** **
Total MS&O revenues $ 2,107 $ 1,935 9 % 8 % $ 1,935 $ 1,764 10 % 12 %
Percentage of net revenues 22 % 22 % 22 % 21 %

The increase in total MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in total MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and Marketplace MS&O revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Marketplace MS&O Revenues

The increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to our first-party inventory program in Korea and, to a lesser extent, our Brands4friends online shopping community. The increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased fees earned for referral services and increased revenue from our revenue share programs, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in fees earned for referral services primarily consisted of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) products on certain Marketplace platforms, which were not included in marketing services and other revenues prior to the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders (the “Distribution”).

Classifieds MS&O Revenues

The increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by increased revenue from our Classifieds platforms in Germany. The increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased revenue from our Classifieds platforms in our developed markets of Germany, Canada and Australia, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Cost of Net Revenues

Cost of net revenues primarily consists of costs associated with customer support, site operations, and payment processing. Significant components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, and credit card interchange and assessment fees. The following table presents cost of net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- -------- ---- ---- -------- - ----- ---- -- - - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 % Change 2016 % Change 2015
Cost of net revenues $ 2,222 11 % $ 2,007 13 % $ 1,771
As a percentage of net revenues 23.2 % 22.4 % 20.6 %

The increase in cost of net revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in costs of goods sold driven by our first-party inventory program in Korea and our Brands4friends online shopping community

42

and increased investments in site operations. The increase in cost of net revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our continued investment in site operations and data centers and an increase in transaction fees for payment services.

Cost of net revenues, net of $3 million from hedging activities, was unfavorably impacted by $19 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2017 compared to 2016. Cost of net revenues, net of $4 million from hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $16 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.

Operating Expenses

The following table presents operating expenses (in millions, except percentages):

------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- -------- -- ---- -- -------- - ----- --- -- - ----- - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 % Change 2016 % Change 2015
Sales and marketing $ 2,515 6 % $ 2,368 4 % $ 2,267
Percentage of net revenues 26 % 26 % 26 %
Product development 1,224 10 % 1,114 21 % 923
Percentage of net revenues 13 % 12 % 11 %

Percentage of net revenues 11 % 10 % 13 %
Provision for transaction losses 272 18 % 231 (15 )% 271
Percentage of net revenues 3 % 3 % 3 %
Amortization of acquired intangible assets 38 12 % 34 (17 )% 41
Total operating expenses $ 5,080 9 % $ 4,647 — % $ 4,624

Operating expenses, net of $8 million from hedging activities, were unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2017 compared to 2016. Operating expenses, net of $3 million from hedging activities, were favorably impacted by $66 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.

The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in brand spend and employee-related costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in marketing program costs (both online and offline programs) partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Product Development

Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other product development efforts, including the development of our platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, and seller tools. Our top technology priorities include artificial intelligence, voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce.

Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $140 million and $137 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.

The increase in product development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. The increase in product development expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due

43

to higher employee-related costs driven by increased headcount; and increased depreciation on equipment driven by capital expenditures as we continued to invest in our platform.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. Our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased data, information security and employee-related costs, as well as costs related to the integration of prior period acquisitions and ongoing realignment of our legal structure.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to restructuring expenses from our global workforce reduction, costs related to the Distribution and expenses related to litigation proceedings in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. The reduction in these expenses were partially offset by an increase in corporate costs in 2016 due to a reduction in synergies that existed prior to the Distribution.

Provision for Transaction Losses

Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.

The increase in provision for transaction losses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher customer protection program costs and an increase in costs related to uncollectible accounts. The decrease in provision for transaction losses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by lower customer protection program costs.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our portion of operating results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment gain/loss on acquisitions or disposals and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. The following table presents interest and other, net (in millions, except percentages):

----------------------------------------- ----------------------- --- -------- --- ---- -- -------- - ----- -- - -- ---- - - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 % Change 2016 % Change 2015
Interest income $ 177 42 % $ 125 29 % $ 97
Interest expense (292 ) 30 % (225 ) 56 % (144 )
Gains on investments and sale of business 115 (91 )% 1,343 ** 268
Other 11 (87 )% 83 ** (12 )
Total interest and other, net $ 11 (99 )% $ 1,326 ** $ 209

The decrease in interest and other, net in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the $1.3 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. in 2016.

The increase in interest and other, net in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the $1.3 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc., and our hedging strategy, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of senior notes during the first quarter of 2016.

44

Income Tax Provision

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except percentages):

------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ------ ---- - - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Income tax provision (benefit) $ 3,288 $ (3,634 ) $ 459
Effective tax rate 144.5 % (99.5 )% 19.1 %

The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.1 billion tax charge for the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”), enacted on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the increase in our foreign tax rate as we no longer benefit from certain tax rulings and a noncash income tax charge of $376 million due to the foreign exchange remeasurement of our deferred tax assets, partially offset by the recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of deferred tax assets of approximately $695 million.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the recognition in 2016 of deferred tax assets of approximately $4.6 billion as a result of the realignment of our legal structure and the associated tax agreements. This was partially offset by the $485 million tax effect on the $1.3 billion gain on the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings, Inc., to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms. We consider many factors in effecting this realignment, including foreign exchange exposures, long-term cash flows and cash needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects. As a result, we achieved a substantial step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms in 2016. The step-up in tax basis of our foreign eBay platforms resulted from our election to terminate an existing tax ruling and finalize a new agreement with the foreign tax authority. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion, which represented the income tax effect of this step-up in tax basis. During the first half of 2017, we recognized a noncash income tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of the associated deferred tax asset. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result of voluntary domiciling our Classifieds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.

As a result of the realignment, we no longer benefit from tax rulings previously concluded in several different jurisdictions. Without the benefit of the rulings, the noncash tax impacts of the realignment in our foreign eBay and Classifieds platforms have increased our income tax rate in certain foreign jurisdictions, most significantly Switzerland. The higher rate results from eBay being subject to a higher enacted tax rate for the foreseeable future.

While we experienced a higher tax rate, the realignment allows us to achieve certain cash tax benefits due to the step-up in tax basis achieved in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect these foreign cash tax benefits to remain consistent, subject to the performance of our foreign platforms, for a period in excess of 10 years. The realignment is expected to extend into 2018 and primarily impact our international entities. However, U.S. tax reform and the new U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings discussed below will reduce our expected consolidated cash tax benefits.

U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2018, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings, and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our accounting for the effects of the Act; however, we have made reasonable estimates of those effects. Accordingly, we have recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidated statement of income.

Included in the provisional amount is $1.4 billion for the income tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. We have computed the amount based on information available to us; however, there is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act. Further, we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation.

45

The remaining provisional amount of $1.7 billion is for the deferred income tax effects of the Act, primarily the impact of the new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. We have computed the amount based on information available to us; however, there is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act. Further, we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation, including a complete reconciliation of the book and tax bases in our foreign subsidiaries. As we complete our analysis of U.S. tax reform in 2018, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustments are made.

Our provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in certain lower-tax jurisdictions outside the U.S. The impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $217 million in 2017, $451 million in 2016 and $549 million in 2015. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in the periods presented include Switzerland. See “Note 15 - Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.

Our relative pretax earnings and revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time. In general, these differences are attributable to higher amortization of U.S. based intangible assets, larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in the U.S. for U.S. based employees, overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily U.S. based and higher average margins earned by non-U.S. businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our U.S. share of pretax income and net revenues was 18.4% and 42.8%, respectively. The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world for 2017 was primarily due to the general drivers discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our U.S. share of pretax income and net revenues was 41.9% and 43.1%, respectively. The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S., as compared to the rest of the world for 2016, was primarily related to the general drivers discussed above, as well as a $979 million gain on the sale of the U.S. portion of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. in 2016.
From time to time we engage in certain intercompany transactions. We consider many factors when evaluating these transactions. These transactions may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. The impact in any period may be significant. These transactions are complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.

We are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments.

Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performance

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we use FX-Neutral net revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing our financial results. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we have historically reported

46

certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.

The following tables set forth a reconciliation of FX-Neutral GMV and FX-Neutral net revenues (each as defined below) to our reported GMV and net revenues for the periods presented (in millions, except percentages):

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents - discontinued operations — (1 ) (3,376 )
Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 304 $ (16 ) $ (4,496 )

Continuing Operating Activities

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and a net loss of $1.0 billion offset by adjustments of $1.7 billion in deferred income taxes, $676 million in depreciation and amortization and $483 million in stock-based compensation.

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.8 billion in 2016 was primarily due to net income of $7.3 billion with adjustments for $682 million in depreciation and amortization, $416 million in stock-based compensation and $20 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 billion related to deferred income taxes and $1.2 billion related to gain on sale of investments.

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2015 was due primarily to net income of $1.7 billion with adjustments for loss from discontinued operations of $222 million, $687 million in depreciation and amortization, $379 million in stock-based compensation and $271 million in provision for transaction losses and a decrease of $195 million related to gain on sale of investments and $106 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects.

Cash paid for income taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $308 million, $492 million and $256 million, respectively.

Continuing Investing Activities

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2017 was primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666 million and cash paid for our equity investment in Flipkart of $514 million.

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was primarily due to cash paid for investments of $11.2 billion, property and equipment of $626 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $212 million, partially offset by proceeds of $10.1 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $673 million in 2015 was due primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.7 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $668 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $24 million, partially offset by proceeds of $6.8 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.

The largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our investments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.

48

Continuing Financing Activities

The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.8 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $2.7 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and $1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstanding debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.

The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $744 million in 2016 was primarily due to $2.9 billion of cash paid to repurchase common stock, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from debt issuances.

The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to cash outflows from $2.1 billion to repurchase common stock, $850 million payment of debt upon maturity and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $221 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the effect of $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

The favorable effect of exchange rate movements on cash and cash equivalents was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro and Korean won, during 2017. The unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates on our cash and cash equivalents during 2016 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro. The unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates on our cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro.

Stock Repurchases

In July 2016, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion stock repurchase program and in July 2017, our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.

During 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.7 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of approximately $1.7 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2017 repurchase program and no amounts remained under our July 2016 repurchase program. In January 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $6.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.

We expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Shelf Registration Statement and Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2017, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in shares of preferred stock, purchase contracts and units from time to time in one or more offerings. Each issuance under the shelf registration statement will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued. The registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.

Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2017, we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $10.1 billion. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate

49

purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. For additional details related to our senior notes, please see “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.

The indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.

Commercial Paper

We have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. As of December 31, 2017, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement

In November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result, $500 million of borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2017 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.

Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875 percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent or LIBOR plus 1.0 percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The credit agreement includes customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to us.

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2017.

50

Credit Ratings

As of December 31, 2017, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-term rated A-2, with a stable outlook), Moody’s Investor Service (long-term rated Baa1, short-term rated P-2, with a stable outlook), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (long-term rated BBB, short-term rated F-2, with a stable outlook). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any further actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase our borrowing costs.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in millions):

------------------------------------------------ ----- ------ ------ -- -------------------- --- ----- - ----- - ------

Payments Due During the Year Ending December 31, Debt Leases Purchase Obligations Total
 2018 $ 1,050 $ 68 $ 232 $ 1,350
 2019 1,833 73 142 2,048
 2020 1,255 62 90 1,407
 2021 978 36 79 1,093
 2022 1,931 25 79 2,035
Thereafter 6,504 47 29 6,580
 $ 13,551 $ 311 $ 651 $ 14,513

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. For additional details related to our debt, please see “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. This table does not reflect any amounts payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2017.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $481 million of such non-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $11.3 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $9.1 billion. As a result of U.S. tax reform, the $9.1 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was subject to current tax in the U.S. in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not repatriated any of these funds to the U.S. However, to the extent we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S.

51

states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. We have accrued provisional deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.

We actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. This arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $1.9 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $2.1 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal, which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

General

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.

Revenue Recognition

We may enter into certain revenue transactions, primarily related to certain advertising contracts, that are considered multiple element arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable). We also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: (1) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as an agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers, determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer’s purchase of our products and/or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation of deemed repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. As of December 31, 2017, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.

The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015:

------------------------------ --------------------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ------ ---- - - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 (In millions, except percentages)
Income tax provision (benefit) $ 3,288 $ (3,634 ) $ 459
Effective tax rate 144.5 % (99.5 )% 19.1 %

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $23 million, resulting in an approximate $0.02 change in diluted earnings per share.

We have accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis. Our accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Our reasonable estimates are included in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017.  We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.

As of December 31, 2017, our goodwill totaled $4.8 billion and our identifiable intangible assets, net totaled $69 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting

units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, we evaluated impairment based on the significant activities regarding the Distribution and Enterprise divestiture in 2015. See “Note 4 - Discontinued Operations” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further detail. As of December 31, 2017, we determined that no further impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required. See “Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Legal Contingencies

In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in legal proceedings, some of which are discussed in “Item 1A: Risk Factors,” “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and “Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
