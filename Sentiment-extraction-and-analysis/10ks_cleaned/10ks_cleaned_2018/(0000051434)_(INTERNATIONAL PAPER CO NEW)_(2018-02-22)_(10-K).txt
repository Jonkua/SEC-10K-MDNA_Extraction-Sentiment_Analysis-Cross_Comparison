Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced transfer of its North American Consumer Packaging business, which includes its North American Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses, to a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company. The North American Consumer Packaging business was historically presented in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment; however, as a result of this transfer, all current and prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the North American Consumer Packaging business as a discontinued operation. In addition, after the announced transfer during the fourth quarter of 2017, the chief operating decision maker began evaluating the European Coated Paperboard business, previously presented in the Company's Consumer Packaging business segment, as part of the Industrial Packaging business segment. As such, amounts related to the European Coated Paperboard business have been presented in the Industrial Packaging business segment for all periods presented. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding corporate items and corporate special items.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

The Company also holds a 50% interest in Ilim that is a separate reportable industry segment. The Company recorded equity earnings (losses), net of taxes, of $183 million, $199 million, and $131 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, for Ilim. Equity earnings (losses) includes an after-tax foreign exchange gain (loss) of $15 million, $25 million, and $(75) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-denominated net debt.

Summarized financial information for Ilim which is accounted for under the equity method is presented in the following tables. The audited U.S. GAAP financial statements for Ilim are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's investment in Ilim, which is recorded in Investments in the consolidated balance sheet, was $338 million and $302 million, respectively, which was $154 million and $164 million, respectively, more than the Company's proportionate share of the joint venture's underlying net assets. The differences primarily relate to purchase price fair value adjustments and currency translation adjustments. The Company is party to a joint marketing agreement with Ilim, under which the Company purchases, markets and sells paper produced by Ilim. Purchases under this agreement were $205 million, $170 million and $170 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE 12 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately $4.8 billion. The Timber Notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their maturity are supported by irrevocable letters of credit obtained by the buyers of the forestlands.

The Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes through the creation of newly formed special purposes entities (the Entities). The monetization structure preserved the $1.4 billion tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales. As a result of tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017, described in Note 10 Income Taxes, this deferred tax liability was remeasured to be $884 million.

During 2015, International Paper initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the $884 million deferred tax liability. International Paper acquired the Class A interests in the Investor Entities from a third party for $198 million in cash. As a result, International Paper became the owner of all of the Class A and Class B interests in the Entities and became the primary beneficiary of the Entities. The assets and liabilities of the Entities, primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third party bank loans, were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date of the Class A interests. The Entities, with assets and liabilities primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third-party bank loans, were restructured which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the 2015 Financing Entities) during the third quarter of 2015. Also, during the third quarter of 2015, the 2015 Financing Entities used $630 million in cash to pay down a portion of the third party bank loans and refinanced approximately $4.2 billion of those loans on nonrecourse terms (the 2015 Refinance Loans).

During the fourth quarter of 2015, International Paper extended the maturity date on the Timber Notes for an additional five years. The Timber Notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in August 2021 unless extended for an additional five years. These notes are supported by approximately $4.8 billion of irrevocable letters of credit. In addition, the Company extinguished the 2015 Refinance Loans scheduled to mature in May 2016 and entered into new nonrecourse third party bank loans totaling approximately $4.2 billion (the Extension Loans). Provisions of loan agreements related to approximately $1.1 billion of the Extension Loans require the bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes pledged as collateral to maintain a credit rating at or above a specified threshold. In the event the credit rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit must be replaced within 60 days with letters of credit from a qualifying financial institution. The Extension Loans are shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in the fourth quarter of 2020. The extinguishment of the 2015 Refinance Loans of approximately $4.2 billion and the issuance of the Extension Loans of approximately $4.2 billion are shown as part of reductions of debt and issuances of debt, respectively, in the financing activities of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Extension Loans are nonrecourse to the Company, and are secured by approximately $4.8 billion of Timber Notes, the irrevocable letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes and approximately $150 million of International Paper debt obligations. The $150 million of International Paper debt obligations are eliminated in the consolidation of the 2015 Financing Entities and are not reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

The transactions described in these paragraphs result in continued long-term classification of the $884 million deferred tax liability related to the 2006 forestlands sale.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the Timber Notes was $4.8 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the Extension Loans was $4.3 billion for both the years ended 2017 and 2016. The Timber Notes and Extension Loans are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 14.

Activity between the Company and the 2015 Financing Entities (the Entities prior to the purchase of the Class A interest discussed above) was as follows:

----------------- ---- ---- ---- - -- - --

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The net expense related to the Company’s interest in the Entities is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, as International Paper has and intends to effect its legal right to offset as discussed above. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, the revenue and expense are included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The cash receipts are equity distributions from the Entities to International Paper prior to the formation of the 2015 Financing Entities. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) The cash payments are interest payments on the associated debt obligations discussed above. After formation of the 2015 Financing Entities, the payments represent interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper.

The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the $831 million tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales. As a result of tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017, described in Note 10 Income Taxes, this deferred tax liability was remeasured to be $538 million, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold 1.55 million acres of timberland for $2.4 billion. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in 2027 issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by $2.4 billion of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the notes was $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. These notes are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 14.

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed $2.1 billion shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities. The loans are repayable in 2027 and are secured only by the $2.4 billion of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within 30 days with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of this debt was $2.1 billion for both the years ended 2017 and 2016. This debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 14.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...
