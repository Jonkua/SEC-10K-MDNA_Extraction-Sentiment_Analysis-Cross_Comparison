ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report.

Resolute Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated on July 28, 2009, is a publicly traded, independent oil and gas company with assets located in the Delaware Basin in west Texas. Our development activity is focused on our 27,100 gross (21,100 net) operated acreage, approximately 90% of which is located in what we believe to be the core of the Wolfcamp horizontal play in northern Reeves County, Texas. Our corporate strategy is to drive organic growth in reserves, production and cash flow through development of our Reeves County acreage and to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in the Delaware Basin.

We closed on the disposition of our Aneth Field Properties located in the Paradox Basin in southeast Utah on November 6, 2017. The historical results of operations of the Aneth Field Properties prior to disposition are contained in our financial position and results as of December 31, 2017 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved reserves were approximately 53.4 MMBoe, of which approximately 49% were proved developed producing reserves (“PDP”) and approximately 47% were oil. The standardized measure of our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, was $433 million. Our future earnings and cash flow from existing operations are dependent on a variety of factors including commodity prices, exploitation and recovery activities and our ability to manage our overall cost structure at a level that allows for profitable operation.

For 2017 the Board initially approved a capital expenditure plan primarily focused on a two rig drilling program spudding 22 gross wells in the Delaware Basin. This original capital program did not contemplate the Delaware Basin Bronco Acquisition or any related capital activities. Due to the continuing efficiency of our drilling and with the closing of the Aneth Disposition, our Board approved an expansion to our 2017 capital program, which allowed us to retain the rigs and completion crews that provided these excellent results. As a result of increased drilling and completion efficiency, Resolute was able to complete drilling operations on 25 wells and had three wells drilling over year-end, while still completing and bringing on line 21 wells in these areas. Excluding the three wells that were drilling over year-end, Resolute carried six drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) into 2018.

Resolute’s 2018 plan includes net capital spending of $365 million to $395 million, including $350 million to $375 million in drilling and completion capital to support two rigs throughout the year, and a third rig which commenced work in late February and is expected to be released in mid-September. Additionally, the Company expects to spend an incremental $42 million to $49 million on field facilities and other corporate capital, and to receive estimated earn-out payments of $27 million to $29 million from Caprock. Overall, Resolute expects to drill 42 wells during the year and bring 38 wells on production, carry six DUCs and have two wells drilling over year-end 2018.

Each of the three rigs will be primarily pad drilling three-well stacks with all the rigs in the same spacing unit at the same time. Operations will focus in the Sandlot unit in Mustang and the Mitre/Ranger units in Appaloosa, with Wolfcamp Upper A, Lower A, and Upper B as the primary target zones. This approach to pad drilling will provide us with the opportunity to batch complete groups of up to nine wells simultaneously.

Beginning in late 2017 the Company shifted focus to building an inventory of drilled wells to batch complete. Two completions are expected in first quarter 2018, and in mid-March we will begin completing our first nine-well group. With the first nine-well group coming on line in May and another nine-well group coming on line in July we expect production growth to accelerate in the middle part of the year. Further groups of completed wells are expected to come on line throughout the remainder of the year.

This 2018 development plan was put in place based on the Company’s experience with the impact of infill drilling on well performance. In estimating its 2018 total production, Resolute believes it has fully incorporated the anticipated effects of frac interference on older wells and the expected modestly reduced production from newly drilled infill wells. In addition the Company has taken into consideration potential operational events that could reduce production further such as power outages, weather, well shut-ins and downstream gas constraints.

On February 22, 2017, we closed on the sale of our Denton and South Knowles properties in the Northwest Shelf project area in Lea County, New Mexico, for approximately $14.5 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The proceeds of the sale were used for general corporate purposes. As part of the sale, the Company was also no longer liable for asset retirement obligations of $3.6 million at March 31, 2017.

On April 27, 2017, Resolute Natural Resources LLC (“Resolute Southwest”) entered into a Crude Oil Connection and Dedication Agreement with Caprock Permian Crude LLC (“Caprock Crude”), an affiliate of Caprock Permian Processing LLC and Caprock Field Services LLC (collectively “Caprock”). Pursuant to the agreement, Caprock Crude has constructed the gathering systems, pipelines and other infrastructure for the gathering of crude oil from our Mustang and Appaloosa operating areas in exchange for customary fees based on the volume of crude oil produced and delivered. Resolute Southwest has agreed to dedicate and deliver all crude oil produced from its acreage in Mustang and Appaloosa to Caprock Crude for gathering for a term through July 31, 2031, coterminous with our other commercial agreements with Caprock. For the first five years of the agreement, the crude oil will be delivered to Midland Station under a joint tariff arrangement between Caprock Crude and Plains Pipeline, L.P. On April 27, 2017, Resolute Southwest also entered into a Crude Oil Purchase Contract with Plains Marketing, L.P. providing for the sale to Plains of substantially all of the crude oil produced from the Mustang and Appaloosa areas for a price equal to an indexed market price less a $1.75 differential that will cover the joint tariff payable to Caprock Crude under the Crude Oil Connection and Dedication Agreement.

On May 15, 2017, Resolute Southwest closed on a Purchase and Sale Agreement with CP Exploration II, LLC and Petrocap CPX, LLC pursuant to which Resolute Southwest acquired certain producing and undeveloped oil and gas properties in the Delaware Basin in Reeves County, Texas. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company acquired these properties for $161.3 million, which it financed substantially with proceeds received from the offering of $125 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2020 that closed in May 2017. The properties acquired included approximately 4,600 net acres in Reeves County, Texas, which were considered predominantly unproved, consisting of 2,187 net acres adjacent to the Company’s existing operating area in Reeves County and 2,405 net acres in southern Reeves County.

On November 6, 2017, to complete our repositioning as a pure-play Delaware Basin company, Resolute closed on a Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which we sold the equity interests in Resolute Aneth, LLC, the entity which held all of Resolute’s interest in Aneth Field, and certain other assets associated with Aneth Field operations, to Elk Petroleum. Total consideration will be up to $195 million, comprised of $160 million ($150 million of which was received at closing and $10 million of which was a deposit received in the third quarter), adjusted for normal closing purchase price adjustments and up to an additional $35 million if oil prices exceed certain levels in the three years following the closing.

How We Evaluate Our Operations

Our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our operating performance, including but not limited to, production levels, pricing and cost trends, reserve trends, operating and general and administrative expenses, operating cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit facility EBITDA (defined below).

Production Levels, Trends and Prices. Oil and gas revenue is the result of our production multiplied by the price that we receive for that production. Because the price that we receive is highly dependent on many factors outside of our control, except to the extent that we have entered into derivative arrangements that can influence our net price either positively or negatively, production is the primary revenue driver over which we have some influence. Although we cannot greatly alter reservoir performance, we can implement exploitation activities that can increase production or diminish production declines relative to what would have been the case without intervention.

The price of oil had been trending lower June 2014 through 2016, although a modest recovery began in late 2016 and has continued intermittently in 2017. We expect that volatility to continue. Given the inherent volatility of oil prices, we plan our activities and budget based on product price assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. We use derivative contracts to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and currently have such contracts in place through 2018. These instruments limit our exposure to declines in prices, but also limit our ability to receive the benefit of price increases. Changes in the price of oil or gas will result in the recognition of a non-cash gain or loss recorded in other income or expense due to changes in the future fair value of the derivative contracts. Recognized gains or losses arise only from payments made or received on monthly settlements of derivative contracts or if a derivative contract is terminated prior to its expiration. We typically enter into derivative contracts that cover a significant portion of our estimated future oil and gas production.

Reserve Trends. We acquired our Permian Basin Properties in 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017. Over that time we have added reserves and production principally through drilling and completion of wells in the Wolfcamp formation. We also believe that our knowledge of various domestic onshore operating areas, strong management and staff and solid industry relationships will allow us to locate, capitalize on and integrate strategic acquisition opportunities which may include acquisitions of reserves.

47

At December 31, 2017, we have estimated net total proved Delaware Basin reserves of 53,428 MBoe as compared to 35,390 MBoe at December 31, 2016. Net proved developed producing reserves of 13,825 MBoe were added through the drilling of sixteen previously non-proved locations, the completion of seven DUC locations and two producing wells acquired in the Delaware Basin Bronco Acquisition, along with 11,939 MBoe of net reserves added through the addition of fifteen immediate offset proved undeveloped locations. Additionally, the 2017 drilling program resulted in an addition of proved developed producing reserves of 6,046 MBoe from successful drilling of eight proved locations. Nine immediate offset proved undeveloped locations to wells drilled prior to 2017 also became economic under December 31, 2107 SEC pricing adding an additional 6,217 MBoe to proved undeveloped reserves.

Pursuant to full cost accounting rules, we perform ceiling tests each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets. We recorded non-cash impairments of the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties of $58 million, and $705 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test limitation. No impairment was recorded during 2017. If in future periods a negative factor impacts one or more of the components of the calculation, including market prices of oil and gas (based on a trailing twelve-month unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month), differentials from posted prices, future drilling and capital plans, operating costs or expected production, we may incur full cost ceiling impairment related to our oil and gas properties in such periods.

Operating Expense. Operating expense consist of costs associated with the operation of oil and gas properties and production and ad valorem taxes. Compression, gathering, water disposal, utilities, direct labor, repair and maintenance, workovers, rental equipment, fluids and chemicals and contract services comprise the most significant portion of lease operating expense. We monitor our operating expense in relation to production amounts and the number of wells operated. Some of these expenses are relatively independent of the volume of hydrocarbons produced, but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period. Other expenses, such as taxes and utility costs, are more directly related to production volumes or reserves. Severance taxes, for example, are charged based on production revenue and therefore are based on the product of the volumes that are sold and the related price received. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the value of reserves. Volatility in commodity prices can also lead to changes in demand for drilling rigs, workover rigs, operating personnel and field supplies and services, which in turn can affect the costs of those goods and services.

General and Administrative Expense. We monitor our general and administrative expense carefully, attempting to balance costs against the benefits of, among other things, hiring and retaining highly qualified staff who can add value to our asset base. General and administrative expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, long-term incentive compensation, general corporate overhead, fees paid to independent auditors, attorneys, petroleum engineers and other professional advisors, costs associated with public company financial reporting, proxy statements and shareholder reports, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation.

Operating Cash Flow. Operating cash flow is the cash directly derived from our oil and gas properties, before considering such things as administrative expenses and interest costs. Operating cash flow per unit of production is a measure of field efficiency, and can be compared to results obtained by operators of oil and gas properties with characteristics similar to ours in order to evaluate relative performance. Aggregate operating cash flow is a measure of our ability to sustain overhead expenses and costs related to capital structure, including interest expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) as consolidated net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, accretion of asset retirement obligation, change in fair value of derivative instruments, non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-recurring cash-settled incentive award payments and gains and losses on the sale of assets and ceiling write-down of oil and gas properties. This definition excludes the one-time cost of the Aneth Disposition and any costs related to stockholder activism.

Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental liquidity or performance measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others, to assess:

 • our operating performance and return on capital without regard to financing methods or capital structure;

 • financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;

 • our ability to finance capital expenditures;

 • the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and pay interest costs; and

 • the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.

48

Credit facility EBITDA. Credit facility EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is defined under the Revolving Credit Facility as consolidated net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, accretion of asset retirement obligation, change in fair value of derivative instruments, non-cash share-based compensation expense, cash-settled incentive award payments, noncontrolling interest amounts, and customary costs and expenses incurred related to acquisitions or dispositions. Credit facility EBITDA for the four quarter period ending on December 31, 2017 is equal to EBITDA for the period beginning on July 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017, multiplied by two. Credit facility EBITDA is a financial measure that we report to our lenders and is used as a gauge for compliance with a financial covenant under our Revolving Credit Facility.

Credit facility EBITDA is used as a supplemental liquidity or performance measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as our bank syndicate, primarily to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and pay interest costs and to measure compliance with the covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility.

Adjusted EBITDA and Credit facility EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income available to common shareholders, net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as measures of operating performance, liquidity or ability to service debt obligations. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate gross margins. Because we use capital assets, depletion, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider both net income and net cash provided by operating activities determined under GAAP, as well as Adjusted EBITDA and Credit facility EBITDA, when evaluating our financial performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit facility EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, operating income and net cash provided by operating activities and these measures may vary among companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit facility EBITDA as we calculate those numbers may not be comparable to EBITDA measures of any other company because other entities may not calculate those measures in the same manner.

Factors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Results

Revenue, cash flow from operations and future growth depend on many factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, cost of services and supplies, economic, political and regulatory developments, competition from other sources of energy and other factors described in this Form 10-K. Historical oil prices have been volatile and are expected to fluctuate widely in the future. Sustained periods of low prices for oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position, our results of operations, the quantities of oil and gas that we can economically produce, and our ability to obtain capital.

Like all businesses engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and gas production from a given well decreases. Thus, an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline primarily by developing existing properties. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production through exploration, development and acquisition. We will maintain our focus on costs necessary to produce our reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through production enhancement, drilling and acquisitions. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from existing reserves and to acquire more reserves is dependent on availability of capital resources, and can be limited by many factors, including the ability to obtain capital in a cost-effective manner and to obtain permits and regulatory approvals in a timely manner.

2018 Guidance

Production: For 2018, Resolute expects production to be 10,950 to 12,045 MBoe, or an average of 30,000 to 33,000 Boe per day. The Company expects average quarterly production to grow from 22,000 to 23,000 Boe per day in the first quarter to an estimated fourth quarter rate of 42,000 to 44,000 Boe per day.

Mix: Oil is expected to make up approximately 52 percent of production, while total liquids are expected to make up approximately 75 percent of production.

Lease Operating Expense: Resolute projects annual cash lease operating expense (“LOE”) for 2018 to be between $60 million and $68 million, or $5.57 per Boe at the mid-point of the range. This represents approximately 36 percent decrease in LOE per Boe compared to 2017 expenditures.

49

General & Administrative Expense: Resolute anticipates that annual cash general and administrative expense for 2018 will be between $30 million and $34 million, net of COPAS reimbursements and capitalization and before one-time costs associated with the Aneth Disposition, or $2.78 per Boe at the mid-point of the range, down approximately 15 percent from $3.27 per Boe in 2017. The Company’s estimate of 2018 cash general and administrative expense does not include potentially material costs related to stockholder activism.

Capital Expenditures: Resolute expects capital expenditures of between $365 million and $395 million in 2018, net of estimated earn-out payments of $27 to $29 million anticipated to be received from Caprock.

Liquidity: At December 31, 2017 the Company had $30 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility. This facility currently has a $210 million borrowing base. In addition to availability under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, Resolute believes its balance sheet provides financial flexibility and optionality to fund the 2018 development plan. Resolute expects to exit the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2.80x and 2.95x with further declines over a five-year outlook when using free cash flow to pay down debt.

These expectations do not include the anticipated positive impact from up to $10 million of contingency payments from the Aneth purchaser, payable in the fourth quarter of 2018, all of which has been or would be earned at today’s strip, nor do they include any potential proceeds from a midstream transaction involving the Bronco properties, which is currently being explored.

Resolute will evaluate its capital expenditures in relation to its liquidity and cash flow and may adjust its activity and capital spending levels based on changes in commodity prices, the cost of goods and services, production results and other considerations.

Stockholder Activism

On February 8, 2018, Monarch Energy Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Monarch Alternative Capital LP (“Monarch”), submitted to Resolute (i) a notice of nomination of three director candidates to stand for election to the Resolute Board at the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2018 Annual Meeting”) and (ii) a proposal to be made at the 2018 Annual Meeting that would repeal any provision of the Bylaws of the Company in effect at the time of the 2018 Annual Meeting that was not included in the Bylaws of the Company in effect as of February 8, 2018 and as publicly filed with the SEC prior to February 8, 2018.

The Company’s Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee will review the Monarch-proposed nominees and the Board will present its recommendation with respect to the election of directors in its definitive proxy statement and White proxy card, which will be filed with the SEC and mailed to all stockholders eligible to vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting.

Responding to dissident shareholder proposals is costly and time-consuming for our Board, management and employees, and diverts the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016

Revenue. Revenue from oil and gas activities increased by 85% to $303.5 million during 2017, from $164.5 million during 2016. Of the $139.0 million increase in revenue, approximately $126.2 million was attributable to increased production and $12.8 million was attributable to increased commodity pricing ($33.14 per Boe in 2017 versus $31.74 per Boe in 2016). Sales volumes increased 77% to 9,156 MBoe during 2017 as compared to 5,182 MBoe during 2016, principally as a result of production from newly drilled and completed wells.

51

Operating Expense. Lease operating expense includes compression, gathering, water disposal, utilities, direct labor, contract services, field office rent, production and ad valorem taxes, vehicle expenses, supervision, transportation, minor maintenance, tools and supplies, workover expenses and other customary charges. Resolute assesses lease operating expense in part by monitoring the expense in relation to production volumes and the number of wells operated.

Lease operating expense increased to $79.3 million during 2017, from $63.7 million during 2016. Conversely, on a per-unit basis, lease operating expense decreased 30% to $8.66 per Boe in 2017 compared to $12.29 per Boe in 2016. The significant decrease in per-unit operating expense is primarily due to the significant increase in production from mid-length and long-lateral horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin, which increased by a greater percentage than the associated lease operating expense.

Production and ad valorem taxes increased 44% to $23.4 million during 2017, as compared to $16.3 million during 2016 and were less on a per-unit basis compared to 2016. Production and ad valorem taxes were 7.7% of total revenue in 2017 and 9.9% of total revenue in 2016. The lower production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 is attributable to the increase in the percentage of revenue realized in the State of Texas, which has a lower effective tax rate than the Aneth Field properties. This decrease is also the result of the timing of the assessment of ad valorem taxes, as they are assessed on January 1st of each year, based on the producing wells at that point in time and are not updated for wells that come online throughout the year.

General and administrative expense include the costs of employees and executive officers, related benefits, long-term incentive compensation, office leases, professional fees, general corporate overhead and other costs not directly associated with field operations. We monitor our general and administrative expense carefully, attempting to balance the cash effect of incurring general and administrative costs against the related benefits, with a focus on hiring and retaining highly qualified staff who can add value to our asset base.

General and administrative expense increased to $48.5 million during 2017, as compared to $32.6 million during 2016. The $15.9 million, or 49%, increase primarily resulted from one-time fees of approximately $6.5 million related to the closing of the Aneth Disposition, as well as an increase in share-based compensation expense due to a shift in 2017 from granting cash-based to equity-based long-term incentive awards and a restoration of short-term incentive compensation which had been reduced during 2016 in response to lower commodity prices. On a per-unit basis, general and administrative expense decreased 16%. Cash-based general and administrative expense was $36.5 million, or $3.98 per Boe in 2017, compared to $26.6 million, or $5.13 per Boe in 2016.

Cash-settled incentive award expense decreased to $16.2 million during 2017, as compared to $34.9 million during 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of the achievement of multiple performance targets (which primarily occurred in 2016) that are based on the Company’s stock price under the performance-based awards as well as a decrease in expense related to the fair value of cash-settled stock appreciation rights under the long-term incentive program. Actual cash payments during the period were $12.1 million.

Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased to $92.1 million during 2017, as compared to $50.5 million during 2016 principally as a result of the 77% increase in production. On a per-unit basis depreciation, amortization and accretion expense remained relatively unchanged at $10.06 per Boe in 2017 compared to $9.74 per Boe in 2016.

Pursuant to full cost accounting rules, we perform ceiling tests each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets. The primary components affecting this calculation are commodity prices, reserve quantities, production, overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense. If the net capitalized cost of the Company’s oil and gas properties subject to amortization (the “carrying value”) exceeds the ceiling limitation, the excess is charged to expense. We recorded a $58 million non-cash impairment of the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties during 2016, as a result of the ceiling test limitation. No impairment was recorded during 2017. If in future periods a negative factor impacts one or more of the components of the calculation, including market prices of oil and gas (based on a trailing twelve-month unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month), differentials from posted prices, future drilling and capital plans, operating costs or expected production, the Company may incur full cost ceiling impairment related to its oil and gas properties in such periods.

Other Income (Expense). All of our oil and gas derivative instruments are accounted for under mark-to-market accounting rules, which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period. During 2017 the loss on oil and gas commodity derivatives was $5.7 million, consisting of $9.4 million of mark-to-market losses partially offset by $3.7 million of derivative settlement gains. During 2016 the loss on oil and gas commodity derivatives was $19.8 million, consisting of $107.8 million of mark-to-market losses partially offset by $88.0 million of derivative settlement gains.

52

Interest expense in 2017 decreased to $43.4 million from $50.7 million recorded in 2016. The $7.3 million or 14% decrease in interest expense was primarily due to increases in the amount of interest capitalized and the extinguishment of the Secured Term Loan Facility partially offset by the penalties incurred related to the repayment of the Secured Term Loan Facility, the issuance of the 8.50% Incremental Senior Notes and additional borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. The components of our interest expense are as follows (in thousands):

Approximately $9.7 million in interest expense was incurred in 2017 as a result of the extinguishment of the Secured Term Loan Facility on January 3, 2017 which included prepayment fees of $3.5 million and $6.2 million of deferred financing costs and original issue discount that were expensed as part of the extinguishment.

In conjunction with the Aneth Disposition in November 2017, Resolute is entitled to receive additional cash consideration of up to $35 million if index pricing targets, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement, are achieved at specified future dates. The contingent payment derivative instrument is accounted for under mark-to-market accounting rules, which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period. During 2017 the gain on the contingent payment derivative was $3.5 million, consisting of $1.9 million of mark-to-market gains and $1.6 million of the derivative receivable earned pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense). Income tax benefit recognized during 2017 was $0.3 million, or 19% of the loss before income taxes as compared to income tax expense in 2016 of $0.1 million, or less than 1% of the loss before income taxes. The lower than expected effective rate as compared to the statutory rate is attributable to the valuation allowance established during 2015, in addition to noncash executive compensation that is anticipated to be nondeductible for income tax purposes and to permanent differences related to share-based compensation. In addition, the 2017 effective rate was impacted by the passage of the Tax Act. The Tax Act resulted in the Company generating a deferred tax expense of $115 million primarily due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset for the reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from a maximum 35% to a flat 21% rate. This was offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets. This Tax Act also repealed the corporate AMT, causing prior year AMT credits to become refundable in future tax years. This refundable AMT credit results in a current tax benefit of $0.3 million. Based on our current interpretation and subject to release of Treasury Regulations and any other future interpretative guidance relating to the Tax Act, we believe the effects of the change in U.S. federal income tax laws incorporated herein are substantially complete. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of the Tax Act on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015

Revenue. Revenue from oil and gas activities increased to $164.5 million during 2016, from $154.6 million during 2015. Of the $9.9 million increase in revenue, approximately $22.0 million was attributable to increased production, partially offset by $12.1 million of decreased commodity pricing ($31.74 per Boe in 2016 versus $34.09 per Boe in 2015). Sales volumes increased 14% to 5,182 MBoe during 2016 as compared to 4,536 MBoe during 2015. Pro forma for the 2015 property sales, 2016 production increased 50% primarily due to the successful drilling in the Delaware Basin.

Operating Expense. Lease operating expense decreased to $63.7 million during 2016, from $79.4 million during 2015. On a per-unit basis, lease operating expense decreased 30% to $12.29 per Boe in 2016 from $17.50 per Boe in 2015. The significant decrease in unit operating is due to the combination of lower costs attributable to field operating efficiencies, property sales and the significant increase in production.

53

Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 19% to $16.3 million during 2016, as compared to $20.0 million during 2015 and were less on a per-unit basis. Production and ad valorem taxes were 10% of total revenue in 2016 and 13% of total revenue in 2015. The lower production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 is attributable to ad valorem taxes in Utah that are assessed as of January 1 of each year and which are less responsive to increases in prices after that date than are production taxes assessed on revenue.

General and administrative expense increased to $32.6 million during 2016, as compared to $31.4 million during 2015. The $1.2 million, or 4%, increase primarily resulted from $3.1 million in reduced corporate overhead reimbursements due to property sales, $1.4 million in increased professional fees primarily related to a terminated potential senior notes exchange and $1.3 million increase in short term incentive expense offset by decreased share based compensation. On a per-unit basis, general and administrative expense decreased 9%. Cash-based general and administrative expense was $26.6 million, or $5.13 per Boe in 2016, compared to $19.8 million, or $4.36 per Boe in 2015.

Cash-settled incentive award expense increased to $34.9 million during 2016, as compared to $1.2 million during 2015. This increase was the result of the grant of time-and performance-based restricted cash awards as well as cash-settled stock appreciation rights under the long-term incentive program and the achievement of multiple performance targets that are based on the company’s stock price. The time-based awards will vest and be expensed ratably over three years. The performance-based awards and stock appreciation rights will vest ratably over three years but their fair value will be re-measured at each period end over their ten-year lives. Actual cash payments during the period were $5.7 million.

Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased to $50.5 million during 2016, as compared to $94.3 million during 2015. On a per unit basis, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased to $9.74 per Boe in 2016 from $20.80 per Boe in 2015 due the significant increase in proved reserve quantities and a decrease in the 2016 amortization base resulting from the $135 million in ceiling test impairments recorded during the period from October 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016.

Pursuant to full cost accounting rules, we perform ceiling tests each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets. The primary components affecting this calculation are commodity prices, reserve quantities, production, overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense. If the net capitalized cost of the Company’s oil and gas properties subject to amortization (the “carrying value”) exceeds the ceiling limitation, the excess is charged to expense. We recorded a $58 million and $705 million non-cash impairment of the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties during 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test limitation.

Other Income (Expense). All of our oil and gas derivative instruments are accounted for under mark-to-market accounting rules, which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet. The change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period. During 2016 the loss on oil and gas commodity derivatives was $19.8 million, consisting of $107.8 million of mark-to-market losses partially offset by $88.0 million of derivative settlement gains. During 2015 the gain on oil and gas commodity derivatives was $76.5 million, consisting of $93.2 million of derivative settlement gains offset by $16.7 million of mark-to-market losses.

Interest expense in 2016 decreased to $50.7 million from the $64.4 million recorded in 2015. The $13.7 million or 21% decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower level of borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and Secured Term Loan Facility partially offset by lower capitalized interest due to a decrease in unproved property costs with qualifying exploration activity. The components of our interest expense are as follows (in thousands):

 Year Ended December 31,
----------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ - ---- - ------ -
 2016 2015
8.50% senior notes $ 34,000 $ 34,000

Other, net 37 128
Capitalized interest (4,129 ) (5,987 )
Total interest expense $ 50,684 $ 64,358

Income Tax Benefit (Expense).  Income tax expense recognized during 2016 was $0.1 million, or less than 1% of the loss before income taxes in 2016, as compared to income tax benefit of $22.4 million, or 3% of the loss before income taxes in 2015. The difference in the 2016 effective rate was attributable to the valuation allowance established in 2015, in addition to noncash executive compensation that is anticipated to be nondeductible for income tax purposes and to permanent differences related to share-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operations, amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and sales of oil and gas properties. For purposes of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources, we have analyzed our cash flows and capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

 Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -------- - ---- - -------- ---- - -------- -
 2017 2016 2015
 (in thousands)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 137,232 $ 83,719 $ 69,479
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (271,489 ) (190,467 ) 199,583
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,930 230,540 (264,117 )

Net cash provided by operating activities was $137.2 million during 2017 as compared to $83.7 million during 2016 and $69.5 million during 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 over 2016 was primarily due to increased revenue resulting from increased production in 2017 offset by a decrease in commodity derivative settlement gains. The increase in 2016 over 2015 was primarily due to increased revenue resulting from increased production in 2016 offset by reduced cash flow driven by 2015 property sales and increased general and administrative costs.

Net cash used in investing activities was $271.5 million during 2017 as compared to $190.5 million used during 2016 and $199.6 million provided during 2015. The primary investing activities in 2017 were cash used for capital expenditures of $306.1 million and acquisitions of $161.3 million offset by proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties of $198.2 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 consisted primarily of $295.3 million in drilling activities and infrastructure projects in the Permian Basin and $7.5 million in facility projects in Aneth Field and $3.3 million in CO2 acquisition. Capital divestitures in 2017 included approximately $157.4 million of proceeds related to the Aneth Divestiture, $25.6 million of cash receipts related to the Earnout Agreement entered into in connection with the divestiture of the midstream assets in the Delaware Basin and $13.1 million of net proceeds primarily from the sale of the New Mexico Properties. The primary investing activity in 2016 was capital expenditures of $188.8 million. Capital expenditures in the Permian Basin consisted primarily of $95.9 in acquisitions and $111.2 million in drilling and infrastructure projects, partially offset by $35.5 million of net proceeds primarily from the sale of the Reeves County midstream assets. Capital expenditures in Aneth Field consisted of $5.9 million in CO2 acquisition and $11.3 million in compression and facility projects. The primary investing activity in 2015 was cash provided by asset sales of $269.0 million. Capital expenditures consisted primarily of $8.9 million in CO2 acquisition and $23.0 million in drilling activities and infrastructure projects in the Permian Basin of west Texas. Capital divestitures primarily included $42.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Howard and Martin County properties in the Permian Basin, $54.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Hilight Field properties in the Powder River Basin and $175.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Gardendale properties in the Midland Basin.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.9 million in 2017 as compared to net cash provided of $230.5 million in 2016 and net cash used of $264.1 million in 2015. The primary financing activities in 2017 were $126.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the Incremental Senior Notes and $20.0 million in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, offset by the repayment of $128.3 million on the Secured Term Loan. The primary financing activities in 2016 were our December 2016 common stock offering ($160.9 million in net cash provided) and our preferred stock offering in October 2016 ($59.7 million of net cash provided), partially offset by $10 million in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The primary financing activities in 2015 were $235 million in net repayment of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $71.7 million in Secured Term Loan Facility principal payment offset by $46.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Incremental Term Loans under the Secured Term Loan Facility.

If cash flow from operating activities does not meet expectations, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures using borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (if available), issuances of other debt or equity securities or from other sources, such as asset sales. There can be no assurance that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness could be limited by the covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility or Senior Notes. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness, finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain production or proved reserves or complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us.

55

We plan to continue our practice of hedging a significant portion of our production through the use of various commodity derivative transactions. Our existing derivative transactions have not been designated as cash flow hedges, and we anticipate that future transactions will receive similar accounting treatment. Derivative settlements usually occur within five days of the end of the month. As is typical in the oil and gas industry, however, we do not generally receive the proceeds from the sale of our oil production until the 20th day of the month following the month of production. As a result, when commodity prices increase above the fixed price in the derivative contacts, we will be required to pay the derivative counterparty the difference between the fixed price in the derivative contract and the market price before receiving the proceeds from the sale of the hedged production. If this occurs, we may use working capital or borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund our operations.

Revolving Credit Facility

In February 2017, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Capital One, National Association, as syndication agent, and Barclays Bank PLC, ING Capital LLC and SunTrust Bank, as co-documentation agents. In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among Resolute Energy Corporation, as Borrower, certain subsidiaries of Resolute Energy Corporation, as Guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, as amended, and terminated that agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility specifies a maximum borrowing base as determined by the lenders in their sole discretion. The determination of the borrowing base takes into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders’ customary practices for oil and gas loans. The borrowing base is re-determined semi-annually, and the amount available for borrowing could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations. Under certain circumstances, either the Company or the lenders may request an interim redetermination. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in February 2021 unless there is a maturity of material indebtedness prior to such date.

The Revolving Credit Facility includes covenants that require, among other things, that Resolute maintains a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) of no more than 4.0 to 1.0. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary additional terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities, hedging, the payment of dividends, and that require satisfaction of certain financial tests.

In October 2017, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of EBITDA to exclude customary transaction costs and expenses incurred in connection with any material acquisition or disposition, and provided for certain amendments to the calculation of EBITDA for purposes of the Revolving Credit Facility (providing for annualization of quarterly EBITDA through the first quarter of 2018). Additionally, the amended covenants prohibit us from entering into derivative arrangements during which such derivative arrangements are in effect for more than (i) for the first year, the greater of 85% of anticipated projected production from proved properties or 75% of our anticipated projected production from properties, (ii) for the second year, 85% of anticipated projected production from proved properties and (iii) for the period after such two year period, the greater of 75% of our anticipated projected production from proved properties or 85% of our anticipated projected production from proved developed producing properties after such two year period (not to exceed a term of 60 months for any such derivative arrangement).  Furthermore, the Second Amendment reaffirmed our borrowing base at $218.8 million. Upon the consummation of the disposition of the Aneth Field Properties, our borrowing base was automatically decreased to $210 million. Lastly, the amendment provided that the borrowing base shall automatically be reduced by 25% of all unsecured indebtedness of the Company in excess of $550 million. We were in compliance with all material terms and covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2017.

To the extent that the borrowing base, as adjusted from time to time, exceeds the outstanding balance, no repayments of principal are required prior to maturity. However, should the borrowing base be set at a level below the outstanding balance, we would be required to eliminate that excess within the 120 days following that determination. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Each borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility accrues interest at either (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus a margin that ranges from 3.0% to 4.0% or (b) the Alternative Base Rate defined as the greater of (i) the Administrative Agent’s Prime Rate (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin for the Alternate Base Rate that ranges from 2.0% to 3.0%.  Each such margin is based on the level of utilization under the borrowing base.

Resolute Energy Corporation, the stand-alone parent entity, has insignificant independent assets and no operations. There are no restrictions on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of funds from our subsidiaries, except those imposed by applicable law.

56

Secured Term Loan Agreement

In December 2014 we entered into a second lien Secured Term Loan Agreement with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which we borrowed $150 million. In May 2015 Resolute and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into an Amendment to the Secured Term Loan Agreement and Increased Facility Activation Notice-Incremental Term Loans with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $50 million of Incremental Term Loans under its Secured Term Loan Facility.

In December 2015, we retired $70 million of the amount outstanding under the Secured Term Loan Facility following the sale of certain properties in the Midland Basin in accordance with mandatory prepayment provisions stipulated in the Secured Term Loan Facility.

In January 2017, we paid approximately $132 million constituting all amounts due under the Secured Term Loan Facility (including prepayment fees of $3.5 million), with a portion of the proceeds from the common stock offering that closed on December 23, 2016. In addition, $6.2 million of deferred financing costs and original issue discount were expensed as part of the extinguishment. The Secured Term Loan Facility was terminated in connection with the repayment.

Senior Notes

In 2012 we consummated two private placements of senior notes with principal totaling $400 million (the “Original Senior Notes”). The original Senior Notes are due May 1, 2020, and bear an annual interest rate of 8.50% with the interest on the notes payable semiannually in cash on May and November 1 of each year.

In May 2017, we consummated a private placement of senior notes totaling $125 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 8.50% Incremental Senior Notes due 2020. The Incremental Senior Notes constituted an additional issuance of notes under the same indenture as the Original Senior Notes that were previously issued (collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes”). The net proceeds of the offering of the Incremental Senior Notes, after reflecting the purchasers’ discounts and commissions, and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $125.1 million. The closing of the Incremental Senior Notes occurred on May 12, 2017.

The Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture (the “Indenture”) among the Company and all of the Company’s subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), each of which is 100% owned by the Company, in a private transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. In March 2013 and July 2017, we registered the exchange of the Original Senior Notes and the Incremental Senior Notes, respectively, with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-4 that enabled holders of the Senior Notes to exchange the privately placed Senior Notes for registered Senior Notes with substantially identical terms. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit our and the Guarantors’ ability to make investments, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred stock, create liens, sell assets, enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries, consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets, engage in transactions with our affiliates, pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness and create unrestricted subsidiaries. The Indenture also contains customary events of default. Upon occurrence of events of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the Senior Notes shall become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act of the trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes. Upon the occurrence of certain other events of default, the trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes may declare all outstanding Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. We were in compliance with all material terms and covenants under our Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017.

The Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior secured indebtedness of the Guarantors, will rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis.

The Senior Notes are redeemable by us on not less than 30 or more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption of 102.125% reducing to 100.0% at May 1, 2018. If a change of control occurs, each holder of the Senior Notes will have the right to require that we purchase all of such holder’s Senior Notes in an amount equal to 101% of the principal of such Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase.

57

Preferred Stock

In October 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with BMO Capital Markets Corp. (“Initial Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to Initial Purchaser 62,500 shares of the Company’s 8⅛% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”), which includes 7,500 additional shares of Convertible Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Initial Purchaser’s over-allotment option for an aggregate net consideration of $60 million, before offering expenses.

Each holder has the right at any time, at its option, to convert, any or all of such holder’s shares of Convertible Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of 33.8616 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, per share of Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, at any time on or after October 15, 2021, the Company shall have the right, at its option, to elect to cause all, and not part, of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of shares of Common Stock for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the mandatory conversion date as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designation.

During 2017, preferred dividends of $5.2 million were paid. A preferred dividend of $1.3 million was declared on December 19, 2017, and paid on January 16, 2018, to holders of record at the close of business on January 1, 2018.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or are party to any options on non-financial assets.

58

Contractual Obligations

We have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:

This table does not include future commitment fees, interest expense or other fees because the Revolving Credit Facility is a floating rate instrument, and we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments or future interest rates to be charged.

(2) Represents purchase commitments in effect at December 31, 2017, related to construction projects in the Permian Basin Properties.

(3) Total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts, obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations, which include plugging and abandonment obligations, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations.

Critical Accounting Policies

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially, from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Provided below is an expanded discussion of our most significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the financial statements.

Full Cost Accounting. We use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations. All costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties, including costs of unsuccessful exploration, costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds, delay lease rentals and the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration, dismantlement and abandonment activities, improved recovery systems and a portion of general and administrative and operating expenses are capitalized on a country wide basis (the “Cost Center”). No gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of undeveloped or producing oil and gas properties unless the sale represents a significant portion of oil and gas properties and the gain significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil reserves of the Cost Center.

In Aneth Field (disposed of in November 2017), we conducted tertiary recovery projects on a portion of our oil and gas properties in order to recover additional hydrocarbons that are not recoverable from primary or secondary recovery methods. Under the full cost method, all development costs were capitalized at the time incurred. Development costs included charges associated with access to and preparation of well locations, drilling and equipping development wells, test wells, and service wells including injection wells; acquiring, constructing, and installing production facilities and providing for improved recovery systems. Improved recovery systems include all related facility development costs and the cost of the acquisition of tertiary injectants, primarily purchased CO2. The development cost related to CO2 purchases were incurred solely for the purpose of gaining access to incremental reserves not otherwise recoverable. The accumulation of injected CO2, in combination with additional purchased and recycled CO2, provided future economic value over the life of the project.

In contrast, other costs related to the daily operation of the improved recovery systems were considered production costs and are expensed as incurred. These costs included, but are not limited to, costs incurred to maintain reservoir pressure, compression, electricity, separation, and re-injection of recovered CO2 and water.

59

Capitalized general and administrative and operating costs include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other specifically identifiable capital costs and do not include costs related to production operations, general corporate overhead or similar activities.

Investments in unproved properties are not depleted, pending determination of the existence of proved reserves. Unproved properties are periodically evaluated for impairment. Unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties, the holding period of the properties, and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties. Properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment when it is not practicable to assess the amount of impairment of properties on an individual basis. The amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized.

Depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties is computed on the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Amortizable costs include estimates of asset retirement obligations and future development costs of proved reserves, including, but not limited to, costs to drill and equip development wells and constructing and installing production and processing facilities.

Pursuant to full cost accounting rules, we must perform a ceiling test each quarter on our proved oil and gas assets. The ceiling test provides that capitalized costs less related accumulated depletion and deferred income taxes for each Cost Center may not exceed the sum of (1) the present value of future net revenue from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using current prices, excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet, and a discount factor of 10%; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) income tax effects related to differences in the book and tax basis of oil and gas properties. Should the net capitalized costs for a Cost Center exceed the sum of the components noted above, an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent of the excess capitalized costs.

The quarterly ceiling test is primarily impacted by commodity prices, changes in estimated reserve quantities, reserves produced, overall exploration and development costs, depletion expense, and deferred taxes.  If pricing conditions decline, or if there is a negative impact on one or more of the other components of the calculation, we may incur full cost ceiling test impairments in future quarters.  The calculated ceiling limitation is not intended to be indicative of the fair market value of our proved reserves or future results.  Impairment charges do not affect cash flow from operating activities, but do adversely affect our net income and various components of our balance sheet.  Any impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date.

Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities. Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating, economic parameters, and government regulation. Reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows affect our depletion and impairment calculations. As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates. We prepare reserves estimates, and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates, in accordance with SEC and FASB guidelines. The accuracy of our reserves estimates is a function of many factors including but not limited to the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates. Our proved reserves estimates are a function of many assumptions, any or all of which could deviate significantly from actual results. As such, reserves estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil, gas and NGL eventually recovered.

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions. We account for all business combinations using the acquisition method which involves the use of significant judgment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration given. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based on these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquisition, if any, over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquisition, if any, is recognized immediately in earnings as a gain. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment since fair values are not always readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices (where available), appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and the present value of estimated future cash flows, among others.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is deemed to be a business. Determining whether a transferred set constitutes a business is important because the accounting for a business combination differs from that of an asset acquisition. The definition of a business also affects the accounting for dispositions. Under the new standard, when substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business and business combination accounting would not be required. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the second quarter of 2017.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new revenue standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Entities can choose to adopt the standard using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective approach, which will be applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. During 2017, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the standard on its contract types, and it does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-12 have material impact on its financial results. The Company has also modified current processes and controls to apply the requirements of the new standard. We do not believe such modifications are material to our internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, we do not believe that adoption of the standard will impact our operational strategies and financial results.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to present nearly all leasing arrangements on the balance sheet as liabilities along with a corresponding right-of-use asset.  The ASU will replace most existing lease guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019.  Although early application is permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU.  The standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  Currently, the Company is evaluating the standard’s applicability to our various contractual arrangements.  We believe that adoption of the standard will result in increases to our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.  However, we have not yet determined the extent of the adjustments that will be required upon implementation of the standard.  We continue to monitor relevant industry guidance regarding the implementation of ASU 2016-02 and will adjust our implementation strategies as necessary.  We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of adopting the new standard.
