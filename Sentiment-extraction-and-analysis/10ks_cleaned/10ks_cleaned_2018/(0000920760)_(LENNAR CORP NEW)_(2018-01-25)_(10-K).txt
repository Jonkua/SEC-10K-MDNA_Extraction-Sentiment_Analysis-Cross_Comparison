Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements typically include the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “consider,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or other words of similar meaning. Some of them are opinions formed based upon general observations, anecdotal evidence and industry experience, but that are not supported by specific investigation or analysis.
These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from what is anticipated by our forward-looking statements. The most important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our inability to acquire land at anticipated prices; increases in operating costs, including costs related to real estate taxes, construction materials, labor and insurance; unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings; anything that prevents the CalAtlantic transaction from taking place when expected; our inability to realize the anticipated synergy benefits from the CalAtlantic transaction; our inability to close a one-time transaction expected to take place in the first quarter of 2018; a downturn in the market for residential real estate; changes in general economic and financial conditions that reduce demand for our products and services, lower our profit margins or reduce our access to credit; the possibility that we will incur nonrecurring costs that affect earnings in one or more reporting periods; decreased demand for our Lennar Multifamily rental units or difficulty selling our rental properties; the possibility that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have more negative than positive impact on us; the possibility that the benefit from our increasing use of technology will not justify its cost; increased competition for home sales from other sellers of new and resale homes; negative effects of increasing mortgage interest rates; our inability to reduce our homebuilding debt to our total capital net of cash; a decline in the value of our land inventories and resulting write-downs of the carrying value of our real estate assets; the failure of the participants in various joint ventures to honor their commitments; difficulty obtaining land-use entitlements or construction financing; natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance does not provide adequate coverage; the inability of Rialto to sell mortgages it originates into securitizations on favorable terms; new laws or regulatory changes that adversely affect the profitability of our businesses; our inability to refinance our debt on terms that are acceptable to us; and changes in accounting conventions that adversely affect our reported earnings.
Please see "Item 1A-Risk Factors" of this Annual Report for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties which could affect our future results. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in SEC filings or otherwise.

Outlook
The housing market has been strong in 2017 and there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market, with increased job creation across the country and wages have generally been moving higher. We believe lower unemployment, modest wage growth and consumer confidence should increase household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe that the generally strong, stable and improving economy, together with limited supply and production deficits from past years, have been and will continue to drive demand and pricing power in the upcoming spring selling season, even though that will be offset by land and construction cost increases. The recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has added additional momentum to the economic landscape. While there have been concerns about the new tax law on housing, initial readings and reviews are suggesting that it is generally stimulative to the economy. In addition, concerns about the reduction of the mortgage interest deduction, deductibility of real estate taxes and state and local taxes seem to be offset by overall optimistic momentum around economic stability and growth. For our typical buyer profile, we have found that the effect of the new tax law is generally positive at their income levels. Additionally, the doubling of the standard deduction should help a new group of aspiring homeowners accumulate savings for a down payment to purchase a home and create personal financial stability.
Fiscal 2017 was another excellent year for Lennar, with revenues increasing 15% from 2016. Our core homebuilding business continued to produce strong operating results as gross margins and operating margins were 22.1% and 12.9%, respectively. Our home deliveries and new orders both increased 11% compared to fiscal 2016. Our efficient Everything’s

Included® manufacturing model helped mitigate the impact of a tight labor market and our focus on strategic innovation and higher volume helped to improve our S,G&A leverage. In addition, we ended the year with a strong sales backlog, up 17% in homes and 23% in dollar value, which gives us a strong start for fiscal 2018.
Complementing our homebuilding business, we also had strong performances from our Financial Services and Multifamily rental businesses during fiscal 2017. Our Financial Services segment produced $155.5 million of pretax earnings compared to $163.6 million in 2016. The decrease was due to lower profitability in the segment's mortgage operations as a result of a decrease in refinance transactions, which led to both lower origination volume and profit per loan. This was partially offset by higher profit per transaction in the segment's title operations.
Our Multifamily rental business continued to grow during fiscal 2017, as it sold seven operating properties. With a $9.1 billion geographically diversified pipeline of multifamily product, this segment continues to grow while capitalizing on future development opportunities.
In fiscal 2018, our principal focus will be on the successful integration of the CalAtlantic merger, which is expected to close on February 12, 2018. The transaction is all about creating leadership and scale in the markets that we know best and with the product lines that have defined our companies for decades. With scale, we believe we can drive both synergies and efficiencies as we build best-of-class operating platforms in the most strategic markets in the country. We believe we can use technologies to innovate and improve our operations to drive down costs in our homebuilding operations.
In the first quarter of 2018, we expect to close on a strategic one-time, non-core, non Rialto transaction that shifted from the fourth quarter of 2017. This will result in a profit that will benefit from the lower federal tax rate passed in December 2017.
We expect that our Company’s main driver of earnings will continue to be our homebuilding and financial services operations as we believe we are currently positioned to deliver between 32,000 and 32,500 homes in fiscal 2018, excluding the impact from the CalAtlantic merger. We are also focused on our multiple platforms including Rialto and Multifamily, as such ancillary businesses continue to mature and expand their franchises providing opportunities that we expect will enhance shareholder value. Overall, we believe we are on track to achieve another year of strong profitability in fiscal 2018.

2017 versus 2016
Revenues from home sales increased 15% in the year ended November 30, 2017 to $11.0 billion from $9.6 billion in 2016. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 11% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 29,322 homes in the year ended November 30, 2017 from 26,481 homes last year. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year and by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The average sales price of homes delivered, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to $376,000 in the year ended November 30, 2017 from $361,000 in the year ended November 30, 2016, primarily due to product mix (selling at different price points) and increased pricing in certain of our markets due to favorable market conditions. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $22,700 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2017, or 5.7% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $22,500 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2016, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were $2.4 billion, or 22.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $2.2 billion, or 23.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2016. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 billion in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $898.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 9.2% in the year ended November 30, 2017, from 9.4% in the year ended November 30, 2016 due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.
Gross profits on land sales were $29.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $44.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2016.
Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $61.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $49.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of net operating losses from our unconsolidated entities which were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses and valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by profits from land sales. In the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination as well as our share of net operating losses associated with the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity formed as the result of this combination. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties.
Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $22.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $52.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2016, other income, net included management fee income and a profit participation related to Lennar Homebuilding's strategic joint ventures and gains on the sale of several clubhouses.
Lennar Homebuilding loss due to litigation of $140 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, was related to litigation regarding a contract we entered into in 2005 to purchase property in Maryland. As a result of the litigation, we purchased the property for $114 million, which approximated our estimate of fair value for the property. In addition, we paid approximately $124 million in interest and other closing costs and have accrued for the amount we expect to pay as reimbursement for attorney's fees.
Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $277.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 ($260.7 million was included in costs of homes sold, $10.0 million in costs of land sold and $7.2 million in other interest expense), compared to $245.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2016 ($235.1 million was included in costs of homes sold, $5.3 million in costs of land sold and $4.6 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.
Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $155.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $163.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. Operating earnings decreased due to lower profitability in the segment's mortgage operations as a result of a decrease in refinance transactions, which led to both lower origination volume and profit per loan. This was partially offset by higher profit per transaction in the segment's title operations and earnings from the real estate brokerage business which was acquired as part of the WCI acquisition in February 2017.
Operating earnings for our Rialto segment were $23.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 (which included $22.5 million of operating loss and an add back of $46.1 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings in the year ended November 30, 2016 were $2.1 million (which included $16.7 million of operating loss and add back

of $18.8 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). The increase in operating earnings was primarily related to an increase in incentive income related to carried interest distributions from the Rialto real estate funds, as well as an increase in management fee income and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by an increase in REO and loan impairments and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the year ended November 30, 2016 included a $16.0 million write-off of uncollectible receivables related to a hospital, which was acquired through the resolution of one of Rialto's loans from a 2010 portfolio.
Operating earnings for our Lennar Multifamily segment were $73.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to operating earnings of $71.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the segment's $96.7 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities, compared to the segment's $91.0 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities in the year ended November 30, 2016.
Corporate general and administrative expenses were $285.9 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $232.6 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to personnel and related expenses and professional expenses related to technology investments.
Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were ($38.7) million and $1.2 million in the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC in 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures, partially offset by a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC.
In the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, we had a tax provision of $417.9 million and $417.4 million, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rates were 34.02% and 31.40% for the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is primarily the result of the new energy efficient home credits expiring during the year ended November 30, 2017, which increased our effective tax rate by 1.74%. For the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the impact of this tax credit was (0.73%) and (2.47%), respectively.
In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted which will have a positive impact on our effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years. The tax reform bill will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 from 34% to approximately 25%. Excluded from our 2018 effective tax rate is a one-time non-cash write-down of our deferred tax assets of approximately $70 million which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of our lower federal tax rate.
2016 versus 2015
Revenues from home sales increased 15% in the year ended November 30, 2016 to $9.6 billion from $8.3 billion in 2015. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 5% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 26,481 homes in the year ended November 30, 2016 from 24,209 homes in 2015. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2015 and by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $361,000 in the year ended November 30, 2016 from $344,000 in the year ended November 30, 2015, primarily due to product mix and increased pricing in certain of our markets due to favorable market conditions. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $22,500 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2016, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $21,400 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2015, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue.
Gross margins on home sales were $2.2 billion, or 23.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $2.0 billion, or 24.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2015. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $898.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $831.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 9.4% in the year ended November 30, 2016, from 10.0% in the year ended November 30, 2015 due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries and benefits from our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales were $44.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $30.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015.

Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was ($49.3) million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $63.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2015. In the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination and operational net losses from the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity, totaling $42.6 million. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties. In the year ended November 30, 2015, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities included $82.8 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to sales of homesites and a commercial property to third parties, sales of homesites to another joint venture in which we have a 50% investment, and a gain on debt extinguishment.
Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $52.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $6.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2015. In the year ended November 30, 2016, other income, net, included management fee income and a profit participation related to Lennar Homebuilding's strategic joint ventures and gains on the sale of several clubhouses. In the year ended November 30, 2015, other income, net included $10.2 million aggregate gains on sales of an operating property and a clubhouse.
Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $245.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2016 ($235.1 million was included in costs of homes sold, $5.3 million in costs of land sold and $4.6 million in other interest expense), compared to $220.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015 ($205.2 million was included in costs of homes sold, $2.5 million in costs of land sold and $12.5 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.
Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $163.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $127.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2015. The increase in profitability was primarily due to increased transactions and higher profit per transaction in the segment's mortgage and title operations.
Operating earnings for our Rialto segment were $2.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2016 (which included a $16.7 million operating loss and an add back of $18.8 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings in the year ended November 30, 2015 were $28.8 million (which included $33.6 million of operating earnings, partially offset by $4.8 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests).The decrease in operating earnings was primarily attributable to a $16.0 million write-off of uncollectible receivables related to a hospital, which was acquired through the resolution of one of Rialto's loans from a 2010 portfolio, a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of REO, an increase in REO and loan impairments, and general and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by an increase in operating earnings related to RMF as a result of higher securitization margins. The hospital is managed by a third party management company.
Operating earnings for our Lennar Multifamily segment were $71.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to an operating loss of $7.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2015. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the segment's $91.0 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities. In the year ended November 30, 2015, the operating loss in Lennar Multifamily primarily related to general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the segment's $22.2 million share of gains as a result of the sale of two operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities, management fee income and general contractor income, net.
Corporate general and administrative expenses were $232.6 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2016, compared to $216.2 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2015. As a percentage of total revenues, corporate general and administrative expenses improved due to increased operating leverage.
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $1.2 million and $16.3 million in the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures, partially offset by a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures and net earnings related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC.
In the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a tax provision of $417.4 million and $390.4 million, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rates were 31.40% and 32.72% for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The reduction is primarily the result of the reversal of an accrual due to a settlement with the IRS in the year ended November 30, 2016, which reduced our effective tax rate by (1.02%). During the year ended November 30, 2016, tax legislation was passed extending the new energy efficient home credit through 2016, as well as extending the 30% investment

tax credit for solar energy property through 2022. For the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the impact of these tax credits was (3.46%) and (1.92%), respectively.

Homebuilding Segments
Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and attempt to minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures.
As of and for the year ended November 30, 2017, we have aggregated our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, and Homebuilding West, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography, and product type. Information about homebuilding activities in states that do not have economic characteristics that are similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not a reportable segment. References in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those three reportable segments.
At November 30, 2017 our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in:
East: Florida(1), Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia
Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas
West: California and Nevada

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.

2017 versus 2016
Homebuilding East: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Florida and the Carolinas, partially offset by a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Georgia and Virginia. Revenues from home sales also increased as a result of the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas, partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Georgia and Virginia. The increase in the number of deliveries in Florida was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year primarily related to the WCI acquisition. The increase in the number of deliveries in the Carolinas was primarily driven by an increase in active communities. The decrease in the number of deliveries in Georgia and Virginia was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries per active community as a result of timing of opening and closing of communities. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced communities and favorable market conditions. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Georgia and Virginia was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher-priced communities and opening lower-priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2017. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Homebuilding Central: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Texas and Arizona and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries in Texas was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased and the number of active communities increased. The increase in the number of deliveries in Arizona was primarily driven by an increase in the number of active communities. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in land and direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Homebuilding West: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and average sales price in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of home deliveries is primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix and favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in direct construction and land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Homebuilding Other: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in Minnesota and Tennessee, partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all states in Homebuilding Other except Washington. The increase in the number of deliveries in Minnesota and Tennessee was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all states in Homebuilding Other, except Washington, was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher-priced communities and opening lower-priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2017. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Washington was primarily due to favorable market conditions and a change in product mix. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 increased compared to the same period last year primarily due to a decrease in construction costs per home delivered as the average sales price of homes delivered decreased as well.
2016 versus 2015
Homebuilding East: Revenues from home sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment, except Virginia and Georgia, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment, except Florida. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2015 primarily in Florida and/or driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in home deliveries in Virginia and Georgia was primarily driven by a decrease in active communities that had a high volume of home deliveries in 2015. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix as there was an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced communities in 2016 compared to 2015 and/or because we have been able to increase the sales price in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in Florida was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher-priced communities in 2015 and opening lower-priced communities in 2016. In addition, we have also been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in land and direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in average sales price of homes delivered.

Table of Contents

Homebuilding Central: Revenues from home sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix driven by an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced close out communities in 2016 compared to 2015 and/or because we have been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales slightly decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Homebuilding West: Revenues from home sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in California, partially offset by a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Nevada and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries in California was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2015 and/or by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the number of deliveries in Nevada was primarily driven by lower demand as the number of deliveries per active community decreased due to a change in product mix (selling at different price points) from 2015. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix (selling at different price points) and/or because we have been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in land costs per home and an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.
Homebuilding Other: Revenues from home sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in Homebuilding Other and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all states in Homebuilding Other, except Minnesota. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2015 and/or by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced communities in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Minnesota was primarily due to the lower average sales price of the homes acquired in backlog. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and a decrease in construction and land costs per home (prior year's land costs per home included a valuation adjustment of $9.6 million in our Northeast Urban operations).
Lennar Financial Services Segment
Our Lennar Financial Services reportable segment provides mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of our homes and others. Our Lennar Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Several claims of this type have been asserted against us. We do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business.
As part of the WCI acquisition in February 2017, Lennar Financial Services acquired a real estate brokerage business

Rialto Segment
Our Rialto reportable segment is a commercial real estate investment, investment management, and finance company focused on raising, investing and managing third-party capital, originating and selling into securitizations commercial mortgage loans as well as investing our own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Rialto utilizes its vertically-integrated investment and operating platform to underwrite, perform diligence, acquire, manage, workout and add value to diverse portfolios of real estate loans, properties and securities as well as providing strategic real estate capital. Rialto's primary focus is to manage third-party capital and to originate and sell into securitizations commercial mortgage loans. Rialto has continued the workout and/or oversight of billions of dollars of real estate assets across the United States, including commercial and residential real estate loans and properties as well as mortgage backed securities with the objective of generating superior, risk-adjusted returns. To date, many of the investment and management opportunities have arisen from the dislocation in the United States real estate markets and the restructuring and recapitalization of those markets.

Rialto Mortgage Finance
RMF originates and sells into securitizations five, seven and ten year commercial first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing properties. This business has become a significant contributor to Rialto's revenues.
During the year ended November 30, 2017, RMF originated loans with a total principal balance of $1.7 billion, of which $1.6 billion were recorded as loans held-for-sale and $98.4 million as accrual loans within loans receivable, net, and sold $1.5 billion of loans into 12 separate securitizations. During the year ended November 30, 2016, RMF originated loans with a total principal balance of $1.8 billion of which $1.7 billion were recorded as loans held-for-sale and $81.2 million were recorded as accrual loans within loans receivable, net, and sold $1.9 billion of loans into 11 separate securitizations. As of November 30, 2017, there were no unsettled transactions. As of November 30, 2016, originated loans with an unpaid principal balance of $199.8 million were sold into a securitization trust but not settled and thus were included as Rialto's receivables, net.
FDIC Portfolios
In 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies ("LLCs") in partnership with the FDIC ("FDIC Portfolios"). The LLCs met the accounting definition of VIEs and since we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, we consolidated the LLCs. In February 2017, the FDIC exercised its “clean-up call rights” under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. As a result, Rialto had until July 10, 2017 to liquidate and sell the assets in the FDIC Portfolios. On July 10, 2017, Rialto and the FDIC entered into an

37

Table of Contents

agreement which extended the original agreement date to January 10, 2018. At November 30, 2017, the consolidated LLCs had total combined assets of $48.8 million, which primarily included $23.8 million in cash, $20.0 million of real estate owned, net and $1.6 million of loans held-for-sale. As of January 11, 2018, (1) the FDIC can, at its discretion, sell any remaining assets, or (2) Rialto has the option to purchase the FDIC's interest in the portfolios. As of January 19, 2018, there were only four assets with a carrying value totaling $0.3 million which were not under contract to sell.
Investments
Rialto is the sponsor of and an investor in private equity vehicles that invest in and manage real estate related assets and other related investments. These include:

---------------------------------- -------------- -------------------------------------------

Private Equity Vehicle Inception Year Commitment
Rialto Real Estate Fund, LP 2010 $700 million (including $75 million by us)
Rialto Real Estate Fund II, LP 2012 $1.3 billion (including $100 million by us)
Rialto Mezzanine Partners Fund, LP 2013 $300 million (including $34 million by us)
Rialto Capital CMBS Funds 2014 $119 million (including $52 million by us)
Rialto Real Estate Fund III 2015 $1.9 billion (including $140 million by us)
Rialto Credit Partnership, LP 2016 $220 million (including $20 million by us)

Rialto also earns fees for its role as a manager of these vehicles and for providing asset management and other services to those vehicles and other third parties.
At November 30, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of Rialto's commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") was $179.7 million and $71.3 million, respectively. These securities were purchased at discount rates ranging from 9% to 84% with coupon rates ranging from 1.3% to 5.0%, stated and assumed final distribution dates between November 2020 and October 2027, and stated maturity dates between November 2043 and March 2059. The Rialto segment reviews changes in estimated cash flows periodically to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on its CMBS. Based on the Rialto segment’s assessment, no impairment charges were recorded during any of the years ended November 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Rialto segment classified these securities as held-to-maturity based on its intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity.
During 2017, Rialto purchased a 5% vertical strip in three separate CMBS transactions. A vertical interest is an equal interest in each class of securities issued in the securitization (e.g., 5.0% of each class) or a single vertical security entitling the holder to a specific percentage of the amounts paid on each class of those securities. As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act that came into effect in December 2016, originators that contribute loans to a CMBS trust are required to satisfy risk retention rules. Some risk retention rules permit the retention of risk by third parties, and the risk may be held by purchasing vertical, horizontal or other combined strips in a securitization.
Lennar Multifamily Segment
We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.
As of November 30, 2017 and 2016, our balance sheet had $710.7 million and $526.1 million, respectively, of assets related to our Lennar Multifamily segment, which included investments in unconsolidated entities of $407.5 million and $318.6 million, respectively. Our net investment in the Lennar Multifamily segment as of November 30, 2017 and 2016 was $561.0 million and $412.9 million, respectively. During the year ended November 30, 2017, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold seven operating properties through its unconsolidated entities resulting in the segment's $96.7 million share of gains. During the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold seven and two operating properties, respectively, through its unconsolidated entities resulting in the segment's $91.0 million and $22.2 million share of gains, respectively. During the year ended November 30, 2016, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold land to third parties generating gross profit of $5.6 million.
Our Lennar Multifamily segment had equity investments in 27 and 28 unconsolidated entities (including the Lennar Multifamily Venture, the "Venture") as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of November 30, 2017, our Lennar Multifamily segment had interests in 53 communities with development costs of $5.1 billion, of which 13 communities were completed and operating, 12 communities were partially completed and leasing, 22 communities were under construction and the remaining communities were either owned or under contract. As of November 30, 2017, our Lennar Multifamily segment also had a pipeline of potential future projects totaling $4.0 billion in assets across a number of states that would be developed primarily by future unconsolidated entities.

The Venture is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets with $2.2 billion in equity commitments, including a $504 million co-investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs.

Financial Condition and Capital Resources
At November 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents related to our homebuilding, financial services, Rialto and multifamily operations of $2.7 billion, compared to $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At November 30, 2017, cash included $1.16 billion, which will be paid to CalAtlantic stockholders in connection with the acquisition of CalAtlantic.
We finance all of our activities including Homebuilding, financial services, Rialto, multifamily and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and equity offerings as well as cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit and our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility").
Operating Cash Flow Activities
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, cash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $996.9 million, $507.8 million and ($419.6) million, respectively. During 2017, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings, a decrease in receivables, an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by an increase in other assets and an increase in loans held-for-sale of $108.9 million related to Rialto. In addition, cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases, land development and construction costs. For the year ended November 30, 2017, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities were (1) $35.0 million from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $12.9 million from Rialto unconsolidated entities, and (3) $89.7 million from Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities.
During 2016, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net earnings, a net decrease in loans held-for-sale primarily related to RMF due to the timing of the securitizations and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a smaller increase in inventories than in 2015 due to our soft-pivot strategy, and an increase in receivables and other assets. For the year ended November 30, 2016, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities were (1) $86.3 million from Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, (2) $14.0 million from Rialto unconsolidated entities, and (3) $1.7 million from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.
During 2015, cash used in operating activities was impacted by an increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases and land development costs, an increase of $213.5 million in Rialto loans held-for-sale related to RMF and an increase of $105.2 million in Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale, partially offset by our net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities. For the year ended November 30, 2015, distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities were (1) $26.3 million from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $21.1 million from Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, and (3) $13.3 million from Rialto unconsolidated entities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities

In addition, we had cash contributions to unconsolidated entities of $430.3 million, which included (1) $261.9 million to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities primarily for working capital and paydowns of joint venture debt, including $120.7 million to Five Point, (2) $119.7 million to Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities primarily for working capital and (3) $48.7 million to Rialto unconsolidated entities comprised primarily of $32.9 million contributed to Rialto Real Estate Fund III ("Fund III"), $8.8 million contributed to the Rialto Credit Partnership, LP ("RCP") and $7.0 million contributed to other investments. In addition, cash used in investing activities was impacted by purchases of CMBS bonds by our Rialto segment. This was partially offset by the receipt of $165.4 million of principal payments on loans receivable and other, $86.6 million of proceeds from the sales of REO and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $207.3 million, which primarily included (1) $83.0 million from Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, of which $26.8 million was distributed by the Venture, (2) $80.9 million from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, and (3) $41.6 million from Rialto unconsolidated entities comprised primarily of $21.2 million distributed by Rialto Real Estate Fund II, LP (" Fund II"), $5.4 million distributed by Fund III, $7.0 million distributed by the Rialto Mezzanine Partners Fund, LP ("Mezzanine Fund"), and $5.4 million distributed by the CMBS Funds.

impacted by purchases of CMBS by our Rialto segment and origination of loans receivable primarily related to floating rate loans originated by RMF. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of (1) $251.2 million from Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, of which $193.7 million was distributed by the Venture, (2) $44.6 million from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, and (3) $27.4 million from Rialto unconsolidated entities comprised of $12.8 million distributed by Fund II, $11.7 million distributed by the Mezzanine Fund and $2.9 million distributed by the CMBS Funds; by the receipt of $97.9 million of proceeds from the sales of REO; and receipt of $84.4 million of principal payments on loans receivable and settlement of accrual loans.

Financing Cash Flow Activities
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, our cash provided by (used in) financing activities totaled $1.2 billion, ($250.9) million and $394.7 million, respectively. During 2017, our cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the receipt of proceeds related to the (1) issuance of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2022 (the "4.125% Senior Notes"), (2) issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2024 (the "4.50% Senior Notes"), (3) issuance of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% senior notes due 2020 (the "2.95% Senior Notes"), (4) issuance of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2027 (the "4.750% Senior Notes"), (5) $31.2 million of proceeds from other borrowings, (6) $99.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of Rialto notes payable and (7) $195.5 million of proceeds from other liabilities. This was partially offset by (1) the retirement of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 12.25% senior notes due 2017 (the "12.25% Senior Notes"), (2) the redemption of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due 2017 (the "4.75% Senior Notes"), (3) the redemption of $250 million principal amount of our 6.875% senior notes due 2021 that had been issued by WCI, (4) $199.7 million of net repayments under our warehouse facilities, which was comprised of $139.8 million of net repayments under our Lennar Financial Services warehouse repurchase facilities and $59.9 million of net repayments under our Rialto warehouse facilities, (5) $74.4 million of payments related to noncontrolling interests, and (5) $139.7 million of principal payments on other borrowings. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2.95% Senior Notes and the 4.750% Senior Notes will be used primarily to pay the cash portion of the consideration related to the merger with CalAtlantic.
During 2016, our cash used in financing activities was primarily impacted by (1) the redemption of $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% senior notes due April 2016 (the "6.50% Senior Notes"), (2) $234.0 million of cash payments in connection with exchanges or conversions of our 2.75% convertible senior notes due December 2020 (the "2.75% Convertible Senior Notes"), (3) $211.0 million of principal payments on other borrowings, (4) $111.3 million of net repayments under our Rialto's warehouse repurchase facilities, and (5) $127.4 million of payments related to noncontrolling interests.

During 2015, our cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the receipt of proceeds related to the sale of (1) $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, (2) an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due November 2019, and (3) $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.750% senior notes due 2025; proceeds of $101.6 million from other borrowings; and net borrowings of $366.3 million under our Lennar Financial Services' and Rialto's warehouse repurchase facilities. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the redemption of $500 million principal amount of our 5.60% senior notes due 2015, exchanges and conversions of $212.1 million principal amount of our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes, principal payments of $258.1 million on other borrowings, and payments of $133.4 million related to noncontrolling interests.

(1) Lennar Homebuilding net debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). We believe the ratio of net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our Lennar Homebuilding operations. However, because net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results.

At November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of net increase in Lennar Homebuilding debt due to the issuance of senior notes in order to fund the cash portion of the CalAtlantic merger as noted below. This was partially offset by an increase in stockholders' equity primarily related to our net earnings.
We are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, the buyback of shares of common stock, and/or pursuing other financing alternatives. In connection with some of our more recently formed businesses, such as Rialto and Lennar Multifamily, we may also consider other types of transactions such as restructurings, joint ventures, spin-offs or initial public offerings as we intend to move back to being a pure play homebuilding company over time. If any of these transactions are implemented, they could materially impact the amount and composition of our indebtedness outstanding, increase or decrease our interest expense, dilute our existing stockholders and/or affect the net book value of our assets. At November 30, 2017, we had a merger agreement with CalAtlantic discussed below that included the cash consideration portion that caused us to issue the 2.95% Senior Notes and 4.750% Senior Notes as noted in the financing cash flow activities above.
On October 29, 2017, Lennar and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar (“Merger Sub”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with CalAtlantic, a Homebuilding company. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, CalAtlantic will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). CalAtlantic builds well-crafted homes in thoughtfully designed communities that meet the desires of customers across the homebuilding spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in over 43 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 19 states. CalAtlantic also provides mortgage, title and escrow services.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, CalAtlantic’s stockholders will receive 0.885 shares of our Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic’s common stock. CalAtlantic’s stockholders will also have the option to exchange all or a portion of their shares of common stock for cash in an amount of $48.26 per share (the "Cash Election Option") in lieu of receiving our Class A common stock, subject to a maximum cash amount of $1.16 billion. The Cash Election Option will be subject to proration to the extent they exceed the maximum cash amount. A major stockholder of CalAtlantic has agreed that it will be deemed to elect to exercise the Cash Election Option to the extent actual exercises are less than the maximum amount. Therefore, we will pay the maximum amount in cash regardless of how many CalAtlantic stockholders exercise the Cash Election Option. No fractional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued in the Merger. Any holder of CalAtlantic’s common stock who would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of our Class A common stock will instead receive cash equal to the market value of a share of such Class A common stock (based on the last sale price reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day before the closing date). On a pro forma basis, CalAtlantic stockholders are expected to own

41

Table of Contents

approximately 26% of the combined company. The transaction, which must be approved by both CalAtlantic and our stockholders, is expected to close on or shortly after February 12, 2018.
The transaction will make us the largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of revenues. We expect that the transaction will result in significant savings in the cost of producing homes and reductions of general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues. When our Board of Directors was considering the transaction, our management estimated that we expected to achieve cost savings and other synergy benefits from the transaction of approximately $100 million in fiscal year 2018 and $365 million per year after that.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, CalAtlantic had an average of 565 selling communities, had delivered 14,602 homes at an average sales price of $450,000 and had net new orders of 15,205 homes at an average sales price of $459,000. At December 31, 2017, CalAtlantic had a backlog of 6,420 home sale contracts with a total backlog dollar value of $3.2 billion.

Our Lennar Homebuilding average debt outstanding was $5.7 billion with an average rate for interest incurred of 4.8% for the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $5.1 billion with an average rate for interest incurred of 5.1% for the year ended November 30, 2016. Interest incurred related to Lennar Homebuilding debt for the year ended November 30, 2017 was $290.3 million, compared to $281.4 million in 2016. The majority of our short-term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations, proceeds from debt as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility.

(1) Interest is payable semi-annually for each of the series of senior notes. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, but are guaranteed by substantially all of the our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) We generally uses the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, which can include the repayment or repurchase of other outstanding senior notes, except the proceeds from issuance of our 2.95% senior notes due 2020 and our 4.750% senior notes due 2027 will be used primarily for the Cash Election Option in connection with the merger of CalAtlantic.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100% and $100 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100.5%.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) We issued $350 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100% and $250 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100.25%.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) We issued $350 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100%, $175 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 98.073% and $50 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 98.250%.

In November 2017, we redeemed the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Senior Notes due 2017. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
In November 2017, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Notes and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes at a price of 100% in a private placement. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of initial purchaser’s discount and certain expenses, were $1.19 billion. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the portion of cash consideration payable by us in connection with the Merger, to pay expenses related to the Merger and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2.95% Senior Notes and 4.750% Senior Notes is due semi-annually beginning May 29, 2018.
In August 2017, we redeemed the $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due 2021 that we assumed as a result of our WCI acquisition in February 2017. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 103.438% of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. There was no gain or loss recorded on redemption as it had been recorded at fair value on the acquisition date.
In March 2017, we retired our 12.25% Senior Notes for 100% of the $400 million aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Currently, substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing all our senior notes (the "Guaranteed Notes"). The guarantees are full and unconditional. The principal reason our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect with regard to a guarantor subsidiary only while it guarantees a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporation’s debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries’ obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporation’s debt, the guarantor subsidiary’s guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Therefore, if the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporation’s obligations under our Credit Facility and our letter of credit facilities and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries’ guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporation’s debt other than the Guaranteed Notes.

Table of Contents

If our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporation’s borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. A subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of.
In May 2017, we amended our Credit Facility to increase the maximum borrowings from $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion and extended the maturity on $1.4 billion of the Credit Facility from June 2020 to June 2022, with another $160 million maturing in June 2018 and the remaining $50 million maturing in June 2020. As of November 30, 2017, the Credit Facility included a $403 million accordion feature, subject to additional commitments. The proceeds available under our Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement also provides that up to $500 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. As of both November 30, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We may from time to time, borrow and repay amounts under our Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at the end of a period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during the period. In addition, we had $330 million letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions at November 30, 2017.
Under the amended Credit Agreement executed in May 2017, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of approximately $4.2 billion plus the sum of 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income from February 28, 2017, if positive, and 50% of the net cash proceeds from any equity offerings from and after February 28, 2017, minus the lesser of 50% of the amount paid after May 18, 2017 to repurchase common stock and $100 million. We are required to maintain a leverage ratio that shall not exceed 65% and may be reduced by 2.5% per quarter if our interest coverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters. The leverage ratio will have a floor of 60%. If our interest coverage ratio subsequently exceeds 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters, the leverage ratio we will be required to maintain will be increased by 2.5% per quarter to a maximum of 65%. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are also required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. We believe that we were in compliance with our debt covenants at November 30, 2017
The following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2017:

(Dollars in thousands) Covenant Level Level Achieved as of November 30, 2017
Minimum net worth test $ 4,498,214 6,476,907

(1) We are only required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio of equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. Although we are in compliance with our debt covenants for both calculations, we have only disclosed our liquidity test.

The terms minimum net worth test, maximum leverage ratio, liquidity test and interest coverage ratio used in the Credit Agreement are specifically calculated per the Credit Agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable GAAP or common usage terms.
Our performance letters of credit outstanding were $384.4 million and $270.8 million at November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $127.4 million and $210.3 million at November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the performance of certain development and construction activities. Financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of $1.3 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds.

364-day warehouse repurchase facility that matures March 2018 (3) 150,000
364-day warehouse repurchase facility that matures June 2018 600,000
364-day warehouse repurchase facility that matures September 2018 300,000
Total $ 1,450,000

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of $250 million.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Subsequent to November 30, 2017, the warehouse repurchase facility maturity was extended to December 2018.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of $75 million.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. Borrowings under the facilities and their prior year predecessors were $937.2 million and $1.1 billion, at November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold to investors but not yet paid for with outstanding principal balances of $974.1 million and $1.1 billion, at November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2017 was 3.6%. If the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be paid off by selling the mortgage loans held-for-sale to investors and by collecting on receivables on loans sold but not yet paid. Without the facilities, the Lennar Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities.
At November 30, 2017, our Rialto warehouse facilities were as follows:

Warehouse repurchase facility that matures August 2018 (two - one year extensions) (3) 100,000
Totals $ 1,150,000

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Subsequent to November 30, 2017, the warehouse repurchase facility maturity date was extended to December 2019.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Subsequent to November 30, 2017, the warehouse repurchase facility maturity date was extended to December 2018 and the maximum aggregate commitment of the facility was reduced to $200 million.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Rialto uses this warehouse repurchase facility to finance the origination of floating rate accrual loans, which are reported as accrual loans within loans receivable, net. There were no borrowings under this facility as of November 30, 2017. Borrowings under this facility were $43.3 million as of November 30, 2016.

Borrowings under the facilities that finance RMF's loan originations and securitization activities were $162.1 million and $180.2 million as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were secured by a 75% interest in the originated commercial loans financed. The facilities require immediate repayment of the 75% interest in the secured commercial loans when the loans are sold in a securitization and the proceeds are collected. These warehouse repurchase facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature.
As of November 30, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount, net of debt issuance costs, of Rialto's 7.00% Senior Notes was $349.4 million and $348.7 million, respectively. Under the indenture, Rialto is subject to certain covenants limiting, among other things, Rialto’s ability to incur indebtedness, to make investments, to make distributions to, or enter into transactions with Lennar or to create liens, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. Rialto also has quarterly and annual reporting requirements, similar to an SEC registrant, to holders of the 7.00% Senior Notes. We believe Rialto was in compliance with its debt covenants at November 30, 2017.
Changes in Capital Structure
We have a stock repurchase program adopted in 2001, which originally authorized us to purchase up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended November 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. As of November 30, 2017, the remaining authorized shares that can be purchased under the stock repurchase program were 6.2 million shares of common stock.

Table of Contents

During the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, treasury stock increased by 0.6 million shares and 0.1 million shares of Class A common stock, respectively, primarily due to activity related to our equity compensation plan.
During the years ended November 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Class A and Class B common stockholders received a per share annual dividend of $0.16.
On November 27, 2017, we paid a stock dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock to holders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2017, as declared by our Board of Directors on October 30, 2017.
Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Lennar Homebuilding - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
At November 30, 2017, we had equity investments in 38 homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 3 had recourse debt, 10 had non-recourse debt and 25 had no debt), compared to 38 homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2016. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners.
Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures' partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and/or sell specific assets during a limited life-time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non-corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro-rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third-party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment guarantees generally is required.
Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro-rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro-rata share of joint ventures’ earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures or reduce the investment in certain cost sharing unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures’ earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.
In many instances, we are designated as the manager of a venture under the direction of a management committee that has shared power among the partners of the unconsolidated entity and we receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option or purchase contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts, in some instances, require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits are generally negotiated on a case by case basis.
We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments may be subject to a variety of financial and non-financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment.

Table of Contents

Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.
As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third-party debt to finance their activities. In some instances, the debt financing is non-recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment guarantees.
Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market-based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes.
The joint ventures often enter into option or purchase agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off-balance sheet arrangements.
As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity-by-entity basis depending on each entity’s purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint venture’s members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint venture’s activities and the stage in the joint venture’s life cycle.
We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities.
Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuilding’s unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:

(1) Our share of profit and cash distributions from operations could be higher compared to our ownership interest in unconsolidated entities if certain specified internal rate of return or cash flow milestones are achieved.

For the year ended November 30, 2017, one of our unconsolidated entities had equity in earnings of $11.9 million relating to an equity method investee selling 475 homesites to a third-party land bank. Simultaneous with the purchase by the land bank, we entered into an option contract to purchase all 475 homesites from the land bank. Due to our involvement with respect to the homesites sold from the investee entity, we deferred all of our equity in earnings from the unconsolidated entity relating to the sale transaction, which amounted to $4.9 million.

Table of Contents

For the year ended November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of net operating losses from our unconsolidated entities, which were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses and valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by the profits from land sales.
For the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination and operational net losses from the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity, totaling $42.6 million. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties by one of our unconsolidated entities.
For the year ended November 30, 2015, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings included $82.8 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to (1) sales of approximately 800 homesites to a joint venture in which we have a 50% investment and for which our portion of the gross profit from the sale was deferred, (2) sales of approximately 700 homesites and a commercial property to third parties and (3) a gain on debt extinguishment. In addition, for the year ended November 30, 2015, net earnings of unconsolidated entities included sales of approximately 300 homesites to us by one of our unconsolidated entities that resulted in $49.3 million of gross profit, of which our portion was deferred.

The fair values of the assets contributed to this FivePoint entity are included within the unconsolidated entities summarized condensed balance sheet presented above. A portion of the assets of one of the three strategic joint ventures transferred to a new unconsolidated entity was retained by us and our venture partner. The transactions did not have a material impact to our financial position or cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2016. For the year ended November 30, 2016, we recorded $42.6 million of our share of combination costs and operational net losses in equity in loss from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statement of operations.
In May 2017, FivePoint completed its initial public offering ("IPO"). Concurrent with the IPO, we invested an additional $100 million in FivePoint in a private placement. As of November 30, 2017, we own approximately 40% of FivePoint and the carrying amount of our investment is $359.2 million.
As of November 30, 2017 and 2016, our recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were $900.8 million and $811.7 million, respectively, while the underlying equity in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners’ net assets as of November 30, 2017 and 2016 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The basis difference is primarily as a result of us contributing our investment in three strategic joint ventures with a higher fair value than book value for an investment in the FivePoint entity and deferring equity in earnings on land sales to us.
The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities.

Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. Some unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt of different unconsolidated entities. We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt of another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.
In connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender, either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from "bad boy acts" of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of an unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and/or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee).
The total debt of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, including Lennar's maximum recourse exposure, were as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- ---- ------- ------- -

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Non-recourse land seller debt and other debt as of November 30, 2016 included a $320 million non-recourse note related to a transaction between one of our unconsolidated entities and another unconsolidated joint venture, which was settled in December 2016.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) As of November 30, 2017, the increase in our maximum recourse exposure was primarily related to us providing repayment guarantees on one new unconsolidated entity's debt.

During the year ended November 30, 2017, our maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities increased by $16.7 million, as a result of us providing a repayment guarantee on unconsolidated entities' debt of $24.9 million on Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities debt and an increase in recourse debt due to additional borrowings of $7.1 million, partially offset by a decrease due to $13.9 million primarily related to the joint ventures selling assets and a debt repayment of $1.4 million.

Table of Contents

The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guarantees.
In addition, in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral.
In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, we and our joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.
If we are required to make a payment under any guarantee, the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes.
As of both November 30, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of the repayment and completion guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2017, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, the collateral is expected to be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, we have placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for our joint ventures (see Note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).
In view of credit market conditions during the past several years, it is not uncommon for lenders and/or real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, to assert non-monetary defaults (such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts) or technical monetary defaults against the real estate developers. In most instances, those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms, additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers. In addition, in some instances, real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms, which are often, but not always obtained. However, in some instances developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders, and are thus declared in default. Because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests, when these joint ventures default on their obligations, lenders may or may not have claims against us. Normally, we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders. When it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment, we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability. Although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them, at any point in time it is possible that we will have some balance of unpaid guarantee liability. At both November 30, 2017 and 2016, we had no liabilities accrued for unpaid guarantees of joint venture indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities ("JVs") debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2017 and it does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

As manager of real estate funds, Rialto is entitled to receive additional revenue through carried interests if the funds meet certain performance thresholds. Rialto also periodically receives advance distributions related to Rialto's carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to its carried interests in its real estate funds. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks but will reduce future carried interest payments to which Rialto becomes
entitled from the applicable funds and have been recorded as revenues. The amounts presented in the table below include advance and carried interest distributions received as follows:

(1) Net of interests of participating employees (refer to paragraph below).

During 2015, Rialto adopted a Carried Interest Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), under which participating employees in the aggregate may receive up to 40% of the equity units of a limited liability company (a "Carried Interest Entity") that is entitled to distributions made by a fund or other investment vehicle (a "Fund") managed by a subsidiary of Rialto. As such, those employees receiving equity units in a Carried Interest Entity may benefit from distributions made by a Fund to the extent the Carried Interest Entity makes distributions to its equity holders. The units issued to employees are equity awards and are subject to vesting schedules and forfeiture or repurchase provisions in the case of termination of employment.

Lennar Multifamily - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
At November 30, 2017, Lennar Multifamily had equity investments in 27 unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 13 had non-recourse debt and 14 had no debt), compared to 28 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2016. We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.
The Venture is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets with $2.2 billion in equity commitments, including a $504 million co-investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. The Venture is currently seeded with 35 undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased or under contract by the Lennar Multifamily segment totaling approximately 10,600 apartments with projected project costs of $3.9 billion as of November 30, 2017. There are four completed and operating multifamily assets with 1,062 apartments. During the year ended November 30, 2017, $586.4 million in equity commitments were called, of which we contributed $134.9 million representing our pro-rata portion of the called equity. During the year ended November 30, 2017, we received $26.8 million of distributions as a return of capital from the

53

Table of Contents

Venture, except for distributions of capital related to land contributions. As of November 30, 2017, $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion in equity commitments had been called, of which we had contributed $350.7 million representing our pro-rata portion of the called equity, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for us of $153.3 million. As of November 30, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our investment in the Venture was $323.8 million and $198.2 million, respectively.
The joint ventures are typically structured through non-corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro-rata cash contributions to the joint venture except for cost over-runs relating to the construction of the project. In all cases, we have been required to provide guarantees of completion and cost over-runs to the lenders and partners. These completion guarantees may require us to complete the improvements for which the financing was obtained. Therefore, our risk is limited to our equity contribution, draws on letters of credit and potential future payments under the guarantees of completion and cost over-runs. In certain instances, payments made under the cost over-run guarantees are considered capital contributions.
Additionally, the joint ventures obtain third-party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of the rental projects. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, the joint venture debt does not have repayment or maintenance guarantees. Neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In some cases, we agree to provide credit support in the form of a letter of credit provided to the bank.
We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. We believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at November 30, 2017.
Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro-rata basis based on our ownership percentages. Most joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return).
In many instances, we are designated as the development manager and/or the general contractor and/or the property manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we do not plan to enter into option and purchase contracts to acquire properties from our Lennar Multifamily joint ventures.
Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.
Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us or the other partners, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market-based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them.
As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity-by-entity basis depending on each entity’s purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition, development and construction of multifamily rental properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated will be available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint venture’s members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint venture’s activities and the stage in the joint venture’s life cycle.

Option Contracts
We often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options.
The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties ("optioned") or unconsolidated JVs (i.e., controlled homesites) at November 30, 2017 and 2016:

We evaluate all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or make a significant deposit for optioned land, we may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land.
During the year ended November 30, 2017, consolidated inventory not owned increased by $272.3 million with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a transaction in which one of our unconsolidated entities sold 475 homesites to a third-party land bank and simultaneous with the purchase by the land bank, we entered into an option contract to purchase all 475 homesites from the land bank. We consolidated the option contract with the land bank due to an amount that we would have to pay if we default under the option contract. The consolidation resulted in a $320.1 million increase in consolidated inventory not owned and liabilities related to consolidated not owned. The increase from the land bank transaction was partially offset by us exercising our option to acquire land under previously consolidated contracts. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, we had a net reclass related to option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2017. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits.
Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling $137.0 million and $85.0 million at November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, we had posted $51.8 million and $45.1 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(5) Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling $62.0 million as of November 30, 2017, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.

We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2017, we had access to 37,527 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2017, we had $137.0 million of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $51.8 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts.
At November 30, 2017, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $511.8 million (which included the $51.8 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of $1.3 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2017, there were approximately $570.4 million, or 44%, of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds or letters of credit, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Our Lennar Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $2.4 billion at November 30, 2017. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $500 million as of November 30, 2017. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and the option contracts. At November 30, 2017, we had open commitments amounting to $1.1 billion to sell MBS with varying

settlement dates through February 2018 and open futures contracts in the amount of $332.0 million with the settlement dates through September 2024.
The following sections discuss market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business:

Market and Financing Risk
We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities, Lennar Multifamily activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, debt and equity issuances, as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility and warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options. We try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until recent years, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered in the prior economic downturn.

Seasonality
We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.

Interest Rates and Changing Prices
Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense.

Table of Contents

A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by us based on the consolidation of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.
We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results, which may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events.
In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted which will have a positive impact on our effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years. The tax reform bill will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 from 34% to approximately 25%. Excluded from our 2018 effective tax rate is a one-time non-cash write-down of our deferred tax assets of approximately $70 million that will be recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of our lower effective tax rate.

Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Operations
Lennar Homebuilding Revenue Recognition
Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowner’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowner’s receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.
Lennar Multifamily Revenue Recognition
Our Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments. As a result, our Lennar Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are included in Lennar Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, our Lennar Multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method. We believe that the accounting policy related to Lennar Multifamily revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our Lennar Multifamily's revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment builds more rental properties.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 761 and 693 active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.
In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, we identify communities in which to assess if the carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. Although gross margin percentages for the year ended November 30, 2017 have decreased compared

59

Table of Contents

to the year ended November 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in direct construction and land costs, revenues have increased for all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of our Homebuilding segments, but not in Homebuilding Other.
We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above.
Each of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. Our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basis.
In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales and the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow model, we analyze our historical absorption pace and historical sales prices in the community and in other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, we consider internal and external market studies and place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics and forecasts on population demographics and on sales prices in neighboring communities, unemployment rates and availability and sales price of competing product in the geographical area where the community is located as well as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters and the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities.
Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace and sales prices in the cash flow model for a community.
In order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes, we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Those costs assumed are used in our cash flow models for our communities.
Since the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future.
Using all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each asset’s fair value depends on the community’s projected life and development stage. We generally use a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory.
We estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause us to re-evaluate our strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and/or additional write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts.
We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. A majority of our option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. In determining whether to walk-away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property under option.
Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that

60

Table of Contents

the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re-evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options.
If we intend to walk-away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.
We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, management’s projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and/or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future.
Product Warranty
Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment.
At November 30, 2017, the reserve for warranty costs was $164.6 million, which included $16.0 million of adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates during the current year primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other adjustments as well as $6.3 million of warranties assumed related to the WCI acquisition. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.
Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties, (2) for construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers or (3) for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Our Lennar Multifamily partners are all financial partners.
Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de-facto agent, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities" and our pro-rata share of the entities’ earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities," as described in Note 5 and Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For most unconsolidated entities, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro-rata basis based upon ownership percentages. However, certain Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance.

Table of Contents

Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence.
As of November 30, 2017, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2017, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $5.8 billion and total liabilities of $1.6 billion. At November 30, 2017, the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $3.0 billion and total liabilities of $1.1 billion.
We evaluate the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors.
Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities or operating assets by the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities. Such long-lived assets are also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities. The unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of between 10% and 20% in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived.
Additionally, we evaluate if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management and other factors such as age of the venture, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.
We believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIE’s executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.
Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JV’s assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.
Generally, our unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. The accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination of whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment.

Lennar Financial Services Operations
Revenue Recognition
Title premiums on policies issued directly by us are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by us. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.
Loan Origination Liabilities
Substantially all of the loans our Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. Over the last several years there has been an industry-wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers’ representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. A number of claims of that type have been brought against us. We do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While we believe that we have adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. This allowance requires management’s judgment and estimates. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate.

Rialto Operations
Management Fee Revenue
Our Rialto segment provides services to a variety of legal entities and investment vehicles such as funds, joint ventures, co-invests, and other private equity structures to manage their respective investments. As a result, Rialto earns and receives management fees, underwriting fees and due diligence fees. These fees are included in Rialto revenues and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rialto receives investment management fees from investment vehicles based on 1) a percentage of committed or called capital during the commitment period and called capital after the commitment period ends and 2) a percentage of invested capital less the portion of such invested capital utilized to acquire investments that have been sold (in whole or in part) or liquidated. Fees

63

Table of Contents

earned for underwriting and due diligence services are based on actual costs incurred. In certain situations, Rialto may earn additional fees when the return on assets managed exceeds contractually established thresholds. Such revenue is only booked when the contract terms are met, the contract is at, or near, completion and the amounts are known and collectability is reasonably assured. Since such revenue is recognized during the latter half of the life of the investment vehicle, after substantially all of the assets have been sold and investment gains and losses realized, the possibility of claw backs is limited. In addition, Rialto may also receive tax distributions in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income due to Rialto's carried interests in the Funds. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks and therefore are recorded as revenue when received.
We believe the way we record Rialto management fee revenue is a significant accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our Rialto segment's revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment manages more assets.
Rialto Mortgage Finance - Loans Held-for-Sale
The originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We elected the fair value option for RMF's loans held-for-sale in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in securitizations on a servicing released, non-recourse basis; although, we remain liable for certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. We recognize revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished.
We believe this is a critical accounting policy due to the significant judgment involved in estimating the fair values of loans held-for-sale during the period between when the loans are originated and the time the loans are sold and because of its significance to our Rialto segment.
Real Estate Owned
REO represents real estate that our Rialto segment has taken control, or has effective control of, in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale or at fair value if classified as held-and-used, which becomes the property’s new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third-party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third-party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for anticipated date of sale, location, property size, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, we analyze historical trends, including trends achieved by our local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, we then calculate our best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams.
Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by our Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale), is recorded as an unrealized gain on foreclosure in our consolidated statement of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale) is recorded as a provision for loan losses in our consolidated statement of operations.
Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying value or current fair value, less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale. Held-and-used assets are tested for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recorded for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any subsequent impairment losses, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto other income (expense), net. REO assets classified as held-and-used are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. REO assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated. Occasionally, an asset will require certain improvements to yield a higher return. Construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development of the asset may be capitalized.

We believe that the accounting related to REO is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices of comparable properties in the proximate vicinity used to estimate the fair value of REOs.
Consolidations of Variable Interest Entities
In 2010, our Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two LLCs, in partnership with the FDIC. We determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, Consolidations, ("ASC 810-10-65-2"), we identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance and determined that we have the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs’ portfolios of assets, which consist primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans.
The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate our role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolios. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions (i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without the FDIC’s approval), the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs’ activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, we can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans (e.g. REO) and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but we can decide not to follow the FDIC’s suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDIC’s voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance.
In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, we determined that we had an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Rialto/Lennar owns 40% of the equity of the LLCs and has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact their economic performance through loan resolutions and the sale of REO.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which we earn a 0.5% servicing fee.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to $10 million.

We are aware that the FDIC, as the owner of 60% of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810-10-65-2 are met, we consolidated the LLCs. We believe that our assessment that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLCs is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in evaluating all of the key factors and circumstances in determining the primary beneficiary.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

approximately 26% of the combined company. The transaction, which must be approved by both CalAtlantic and our stockholders, is expected to close on or shortly after February 12, 2018.
The transaction will make us the largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of revenues. We expect that the transaction will result in significant savings in the cost of producing homes and reductions of general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues. When our Board of Directors was considering the transaction, our management estimated that we expected to achieve cost savings and other synergy benefits from the transaction of approximately $100 million in fiscal year 2018 and $365 million per year after that.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, CalAtlantic had an average of 565 selling communities, had delivered 14,602 homes at an average sales price of $450,000 and had net new orders of 15,205 homes at an average sales price of $459,000. At December 31, 2017, CalAtlantic had a backlog of 6,420 home sale contracts with a total backlog dollar value of $3.2 billion.

[" as described in Note 5 and Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence.
As of November 30, 2017, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2017, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $5.8 billion and total liabilities of $1.6 billion. At November 30, 2017, the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $3.0 billion and total liabilities of $1.1 billion.
We evaluate the amount over its estimated fair value.
The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors.
Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities or operating assets by the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities. Such long-lived assets are also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities. The unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of between 10% and 20% in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived.
Additionally, we evaluate if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management and other factors such as age of the venture, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.
We believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a to the VIE.

Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.
Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JV’s assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.
Generally, entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment.

Revenue Recognition
Title premiums on policies issued rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.
Loan Origination Liabilities
Substantially all of the loans our Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain claims of that type have been brought against us. We do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While we believe that we For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
