EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Business Overview
CME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol "CME."
Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. We also clear futures, options on futures and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities.
We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial derivatives institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members.
We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. We also clear interest rate swaps and credit default swaps contracts. In September 2017, we announced we will exit the credit default swaps business by mid-2018.
Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers.
Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platform. This execution facility offers our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house.
Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies.
In addition, CME serves as a swap execution facility, which is a regulated platform for swap trading, and serves as a swap data repository, which provides public data on swap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes.

Business Trends
Economic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the United States and European credit crises, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment.
Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our services; depth and liquidity of our markets; breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability and anonymity of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; efficient and innovative technology and connectivity, as well as transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; clearing organizations; swap execution facilities; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers.
Regulatory Environment. Exchange-traded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation. As a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over the last several years, various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have passed laws and regulations that apply to our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability.
Our U.S. futures exchanges and our clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). We believe that the regulations provide opportunities for our business. Our U.S. clearing house has been designated by the CFTC as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization, which imposes various procedural and substantive requirements. Our U.S. swap data repository service swap execution facility is also subject to the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations of the CFTC. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of Dodd-Frank and any new regulations. In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the current U.S. presidential administration to review U.S. financial laws and regulations to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order. Some areas identified as subject to potential change, amendment or repeal include the Dodd-Frank Act and the authorities of the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. We cannot predict, which, if any, of these or other actions will be taken or, if taken, their effect on our business.
As a global company with operations and locations around the world, we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business. The financial services industry in Europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a re-organization of its regulatory framework. Our European operations are overseen by several regulators, including the European Securities Market Authority (ESMA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters decided in favor of withdrawal from the European Union. The ultimate impact of this referendum in regards to the laws and regulations applicable to our European operations remains unclear and is contingent on the terms of the withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in Europe as well as the effects of this referendum.
Business Strategy
Our strategy focuses on building upon our benchmark products, globalizing our company, expanding our customer base, extending our risk management and post trade offerings, and establishing ourselves as the leading exchange company provider of information products and index services as well as enhancing our intellectual property portfolio. We focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to

develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in "Item 1. Business" on page 5.
Revenues
Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and cleared swaps contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty.
While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue:

- ---------------
• rate structure;

- ------------
• product mix;

- ----------
• venue, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.

Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment.
Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options on futures contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate and credit default swap contracts. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products.
Venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves.
Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Privately negotiated transactions include block trades, which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on CME Globex or the trading floor. Privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through CME ClearPort and Exchange for Related Positions (EFRPs).
Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases.
Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services, access and communication fees and other various services related to our exchange operations.
Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors.
Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.
Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services.

Access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers.
Other revenues. Other revenues include fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.
Expenses
The majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume.
Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category.
The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities.
Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices.
Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software.
Other expenses. We incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Communications expense includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access our electronic platforms directly.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Technology support services expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings, Inc. and NYMEX Holdings, Inc. as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in Chicago, New York, India and the United Kingdom as well as other smaller offices located throughout the world.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other expenses include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign deposits.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses as well as dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms as well as other various income and expenses outside our core operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs.
Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at level 3 fair value generally include assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.

For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions, and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant

 33

Table of Contents

assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.
We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.
Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives.
Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests.
Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses.
Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud. The costs associated with these cloud-based hosting arrangements do not qualify for capitalization and are expensed as incurred.

Clearing and Transaction Fees
The following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude credit default swaps and interest rate swaps.

Table of Contents

Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives, product mix, trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.
Contract Volume

Overall contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016. Interest rate volatility remained high in 2017 as the markets continued to experience uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. In December, the Federal Open Markets Committee raised the federal funds rate for the third time in 2017 and also raised the expectation for additional rate increases in 2018. The equity markets experienced lower volatility in 2017 due to fewer market-moving geopolitical events, which resulted in lower equity contract volume. Crude oil volumes continued to grow throughout 2017 as crude oil market volatility remained high, which contributed to an increase in energy contract volume. There was a shift in crude oil supplies caused by an increase in United States crude oil production following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In 2016 when compared with 2015, overall contract volume remained high throughout 2016 due to periods of high volatility. Throughout 2016, we believe that global market concerns, considerable uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy and the anticipation of the United Kingdom's European Union membership referendum contributed to considerable volatility. In the second half of 2016, volume across most of our products lines spiked as the U.S. presidential and congressional elections injected considerable uncertainty into the markets. The crude oil markets continued to show considerable uncertainty in early 2016 regarding the direction of future oil prices as global supplies continued to remain high, which resulted in an increase in energy contract volume.

Overall interest rate contract volume from 2015 to 2017 increased due to volatility caused by continued uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, including volatility resulting from the Federal Open Markets Committee raising the federal funds rate three times during 2017. The increase in short-term interest rate contract volume was also due to the uncertainty surrounding other global events, including the 2017 elections throughout Europe and the U.S. presidential and congressional elections in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, we believe the increase in long-term interest rate contract volume was due to the volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the policies of the political administration in the United States, concern regarding future rates of inflation, and potential for changes in fiscal policy.

The decrease in overall equity contract volume in 2017 when compared with 2016 resulted from periods of lower equity market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index. The comparatively low volatility is believed to be caused by fewer market-moving geopolitical and macro-level events that impacted these indexes in 2017. During 2016, there were periods of higher volatility within the equity markets due to uncertainty regarding whether the Federal Open Markets Committee would begin to raise the federal funds rate in 2016, the deceleration of the Chinese economy, the results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections, and declining global crude oil prices.
Overall equity contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 as the equity markets experienced periods of higher volatility due to the continued ambiguity surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's European Union membership referendum and declining global crude oil prices. The results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections injected new uncertainty into the markets in the fourth quarter of 2016, which we believe led to additional volatility.

Australian dollar 102 106 98 (4 ) 8
Canadian dollar 84 80 74 5 9

Foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016, primarily due to higher Euro contract volume due to uncertainty surrounding the European Central Bank policy. We believe the Japanese yen contract volume increased as market participants turned to the yen as a safe-haven currency as currency rates steadied.
In 2016 when compared with 2015, the overall foreign exchange contract volume remained relatively flat. The decline in Euro contract volume resulted from low volatility, which we believe was due to a lack of global macroeconomic drivers meaningfully affecting the Euro in 2016. The decline in Euro contract volume was partially offset by an increase in British pound contract volume, which we believe was caused by volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in mid-2016.

Agricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to higher corn and wheat volumes resulting from greater uncertainty related to weather conditions in 2017. The increase was partially offset by lower soybean volume due to lower uncertainty related to crop production versus 2016.
In 2016 when compared with 2015, agricultural commodity contract volume increased due to higher price volatility in the first half of 2016, which we believe was caused by greater uncertainty related to weather conditions and crop production for the 2016 growing season.

Refined products 392 363 328 8 11
Brent crude oil 94 98 108 (4 ) (10 )

In 2017 when compared with 2016, overall energy contract volume increased largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility in 2017. We believe the increased volatility was caused by a shift in crude oil supplies as United States crude oil production rose along with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016. Natural gas and refined products contract volumes also increased in 2017 due to higher price volatility caused by shifts in supply and demand in the underlying markets.
Overall energy contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 largely due to an increase in WTI crude oil trading, which we believe resulted from continued price volatility caused by excess global crude oil supplies and the marketplace's increased weighting of WTI pricing as a global benchmark price for crude oil.

Copper 108 86 67 26 27
Silver 98 78 58 25 34

The overall increase in metal contract volume from 2015 to 2017 was due to investors using gold and other precious metals as safe-haven alternative investments to other markets. The increase in metal contract volume was driven by consistent periods of high price volatility caused by the uncertainties surrounding the policies of the political administration in the United States and future rates of inflation.
Average Rate per Contract
The average rate per contract decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 as interest rate, energy, and metal contract volumes collectively increased by 3 percentage points, as a percentage of total volume, while agricultural commodity and equity contract volumes collectively decreased by 3 percentage points. Agricultural commodity and equity contracts have a higher average rate per contract compared with interest rate contracts. The overall decreases in average rates per contract were partially offset by a rate increase that was effective in the first quarter of 2017.
In 2016 when compared with 2015, the average rate per contract decreased due to an increase in trades executed by members, as a percentage of total trading volume, as well as higher volume-based incentives. This decrease was partially offset by the impact from a rate increase in early 2016.
Concentration of Revenue
We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 11% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016, and one firm represented 13% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm.
Other Sources of Revenue
Market data and information services. Beginning in 2016, the partial fee waivers that existed in 2015 ended, contributing to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2016 when compared with 2015. The increase was partially offset in 2016 and fully offset in 2017 due to declines in screen counts from cost-cutting initiatives at member firms and some rationalization as customer firms transitioned into full-priced offerings.
The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, 45%, 40% and 43% of our market data and information services revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.

Decreases in operating expenses in 2017 when compared with 2016 were as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2017, we recognized a net gain of $9.4 million due to a favorable change in exchange rates on foreign cash balances, compared with a net loss of $24.5 million in 2016. Gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations result when subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the first quarter of 2016, we sold and leased back our datacenter in the Chicago area. The transaction was recognized under the financing method under generally accepted accounting principles. We recognized total losses and expenses of $28.6 million, including a net loss on write-down to fair value of the assets and certain other transaction fees of $27.1 million within other expenses and $1.5 million of legal and other fees.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional fees and outside services expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, largely due to higher legal and regulatory fees in 2016 related to our business activities and product offerings as well as higher professional fees related to a greater reliance on consultants for security and systems enhancement work.

The overall decrease in operating expenses in 2017 when compared with 2016 was partially offset by the following increases:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Licensing and other fee sharing agreements expense increased due to higher expense resulting from incentive payments made to facilitate the transition of the Russell contract open interest, as well as increased costs of revenue sharing agreements for certain licensed products. The overall increase in 2017 was partially offset by lower expense related to revenue sharing agreements for certain equity and energy contracts due to lower volume for these products compared to 2016.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Compensation and benefits expense increased as a result of higher average headcount primarily in our international locations as well as normal cost of living adjustments.

Overall operating expenses increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to the following reasons:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized total losses and expenses of $28.6 million, including a net loss on write-down to fair value of the assets and certain other transaction fees of $27.1 million within other expenses and $1.5 million of legal and other fees as a result of our sale and leaseback of our datacenter.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional fees and outside services expense increased in 2016 largely due to an increase in legal and regulatory efforts related to our business activities and product offerings as well as an increase in professional fees related to a greater reliance on consultants for security and systems enhancement work.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized a net loss of $24.5 million due to an unfavorable change in exchange rates on foreign cash balances, compared with a net loss of $11.3 million in 2015.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Licensing and other fee sharing agreements expense increased due to higher expense related to revenue sharing agreements for certain equity and energy contracts due to both higher volume and an increase in license rates for certain equity and energy products.

The increase in overall operating expenses in 2016 when compared with 2015 was partially offset by the following decreases:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Severance and other costs related to the reorganization announced in October 2014 and the reduction of our trading floors in mid-2015 were recognized in the first quarter of 2015, in addition to costs related to a reorganization in the third quarter of 2015. At the end of 2016, our CEO announced his retirement, leading to additional compensation and stock-based compensation expense in 2016. We also recognized additional severance and other costs related to the reduction of our New York trading floors in 2016. These factors resulted in a net decrease in compensation and benefits expense in 2016 when compared with the same period in 2015.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2015, we recognized additional real estate taxes and fees related to the transfer of the ownership of the NYMEX building.

Investment income. The increase in investment income from 2015 to 2017 was largely due to an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested, which resulted primarily from higher average reinvestment balances and higher rates of interest earned in the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. In addition, the increase in investment income from 2015 to 2017 was also due to higher net gains on sales of investments. In 2017, we sold our remaining ownership interest in BM&FBOVESPA S.A. (BM&FBOVESPA) and recognized a gain of $86.5 million, net of transaction costs. We also sold our 2% interest in Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V. and recognized a gain of $2.3 million, net of transaction costs. In 2016, we recognized a net gain of $48.4 million on sales of 28.0 million shares of our investment in BM&FBOVESPA compared with a net loss of $8.5 million on sales of 41.0 million shares of BM&FBOVESPA in 2015. The increases in investment income were partially offset by decreases in dividend income from 2015 to 2017.
Interest and other borrowing costs. Interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2016 when compared with 2015 and 2017 due to an increase in line of credit commitment fees in 2016.
Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S&P/DJI business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2015 through 2017.
Other income (expense). From 2015 to 2017, we recognized higher expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms. These expenses are included in other non-operating income (expense).
In April 2015, we repurchased the $612.5 million 4.40% notes due 2018 and paid a call premium of $60.5 million. As a result of the transaction, we recognized debt prepayment costs of $61.8 million, including the call premium, as other non-operating income (expense). In the first quarter of 2015, we received a termination fee of $22.5 million, net of the portion paid to outside advisers, related to our proposed acquisition of GFI Group, which also was classified as other non-operating income (expense).

The overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 when compared with 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recent U.S. income tax reform. The decrease was partially offset by expense from a state and local tax law change recorded in the third quarter of 2017 as well as from reclassifying income tax expense from other comprehensive income for the sale of the remaining BM&FBOVESPA shares in the first quarter of 2017.
The overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 when compared with 2015 was due to an implementation of strategies to realize additional income tax benefits from the investment in BM&FBOVESPA stock. The overall decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by additional tax expense recognized from the remeasurement of tax positions resulting from a state and local income tax law change in the second quarter of 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Requirements
We have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper, future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.

Operating leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago, New York and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The operating lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in 2032. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $12.5 million to $19.7 million. We also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces and datacenter spaces in Chicago, which expire in November 2023, April 2027 and March 2031. Annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from $5.7 million to $6.2 million, $3.4 million to $4.3 million, and $16.8 million to $18.3 million, respectively. The operating lease for our office space in New York expires in December 2028. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $13.1 million to $14.5 million.
Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations. Other long-term liabilities include funding obligations for other post-retirement benefit plans.
Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2018, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future.
We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, which is set at between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend; however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. CME Group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation, which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 7, 2018, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 26, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $237.0 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $3.50 per share on December 6, 2017 paid on January 16, 2018 to the shareholders of record on December 28, 2017. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capitalization expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year.

Operating activities
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was largely attributable to higher investment income related to our reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund collateral, net of the distribution of interest earned to the clearing firms, as well as an increase in trading volumes and the reduction of restricted cash related to the CME Clearing Europe Limited (CMECE) guaranty fund.
The increase in 2016 when compared with 2015 was attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees and market data revenue.
Investing activities
The increases in cash provided by investing activities from 2015 through 2017 were due to proceeds from the sale of BM&FBOVESPA shares as well as declines in purchases of property and equipment. The increase in 2017 when compared with 2016 was also attributable to the sale of the remaining Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V. shares.
Financing activities
The increases in cash used by financing activities from 2015 through 2017 were attributable to higher cash dividends declared in 2017 and 2016. The increase in 2016 was partially offset by proceeds from a finance lease obligation related to the sale leaseback of the datacenter in the first quarter of 2016.

We maintain a $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2022. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.0 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2017, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid

during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility.
We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2017, guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled $7.8 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility.
The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends.
In March 2016, we sold our datacenter in the Chicago area for $130.0 million. At the time of the sale, we leased back a portion of the property. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the transaction has been accounted for under the financing method instead of a sale leaseback arrangement because our participation in future revenues and development work constitute continuing involvement in the datacenter. Under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds of $130.0 million from the transaction are recognized as a finance lease obligation within other liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. A portion of the lease payments will be recognized as a reduction of the finance lease obligation and a portion will be recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate.
At December 31, 2017, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.3 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facilities.
At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities.
CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders.
To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. dollars in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, we had pledged letters of credit totaling $285.0 million.
The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2017:

------------------------- --------------------- -------------------- -------

Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating Outlook
Standard & Poor’s A1+ AA- Stable
Moody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 Stable

Given our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.

Liquidity and Cash Management
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.9 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available

Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2018 as we have exceeded our funding goal by $74.1 million in 2017. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2018 and the December 31, 2018 discount rate.

Regulatory Requirements
CME is regulated by the CFTC as U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organizations (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important DCO under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank. As a result, CME must comply with the requirements for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.
CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs.
Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 include assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.

For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant

assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.
We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.
Intangible assets subject to amortization assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives.
Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer']:

Revenues
Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and cleared swaps contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty.
While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue:

- ---------------
• rate structure;

- ------------
• product mix;

- ----------
• venue, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.

Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment.
Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options on futures contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate and credit default swap contracts. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products.
Venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves.
Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Privately negotiated transactions volume submitted through CME ClearPort and Exchange for Related Positions (EFRPs).
Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases.
Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services, access and communication fees and other various services related to our exchange operations.
Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors.
Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.
Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services.

Access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers.
Other revenues. Other revenues include fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.
Expenses
The majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume.
Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category.
The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities.
Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices.
Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software.
Other expenses. We incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 market data. This expense may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access our electronic platforms directly.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
