Overview(1)
The Company’s net income for 2017 was $521.8 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to $692.2 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, in 2016. Operating income from the Motorcycles segment was down $157.4 million compared to 2016 primarily due to a 7.9% decrease in wholesale motorcycle shipments. Operating income from the Financial Services segment in 2017 was slightly lower than the prior year, decreasing $0.2 million, or 0.1%.
Worldwide independent dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles decreased 6.7% in 2017 compared to the prior year. U.S. retail sales fell 8.5% and international retail sales decreased 3.9% compared to 2016. In the U.S., the 601+cc motorcycle industry continued to face significant challenges and international retail sales finished below the Company's expectations.

In 2017, the Company remained committed to a disciplined supply management approach focused on allowing U.S. dealers to achieve the right quantity and model-year mix of motorcycle inventory. The Company also focused on positioning its cost structure to better compete in the current environment. At the same time, the Company remained grounded in its long-term strategy and made good progress on its long-term objective to build riders globally. In 2017, the Company finished the year with a net increase of over 32,000 Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S. compared to the prior year. (Source: IHS Markit Motorcycles in Operation (MIO) data for On-Highway and Dual Purpose bikes in the U.S. as of January 1, 2018)

In 2018, the Company expects new Harley-Davidson motorcycle retail sales to grow internationally, but continues to expect challenges in the U.S. The Company's global retail expectations and disciplined supply strategy are reflected in its expectation for reduced wholesale shipments in 2018. In addition, to further improve its cost structure and maintain its world-class manufacturing operations, the Company is commencing a significant, multi-year manufacturing optimization plan anchored by the consolidation of its final assembly plant in Kansas City, Missouri into its plant in York, Pennsylvania. As the operations are consolidated, the Company expects approximately 800 jobs will be eliminated with the closure of Kansas City operations and approximately 450 jobs will be added in York by 2019. As part of this manufacturing optimization plan the Company will also close its wheel operations in Adelaide, Australia. Refer to the "Manufacturing Optimization Costs and Savings" below for further information.

As the Company looks forward, it will continue to focus on its long-term strategy of growing ridership in the U.S. and growing its reach and impact internationally, while growing market share and profitability globally. In 2018, the Company will continue to expand its independent dealer network outside the U.S. In addition, operations will begin at the Company's new facility in Thailand. This plant, like the Company's facility in Brazil, will support more competitive retail pricing in some of the

23

emerging markets that this plant will serve by reducing the tax and tariff burden that fully assembled imports carry in those markets.

In 2018, the Company will also continue to invest in new products. A portion of the benefit from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) enacted in the U.S. in late 2017 will support the Company's objective to invest in high-impact product by redefining product in traditional spaces and expanding into new spaces such as the rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape. The Company plans to bring Project Livewire, an electric Harley-Davidson motorcycle, to market within 18 months and will increase its investment in electric motorcycle technology, products and infrastructure in 2018 and beyond. The Company expects its increased commitment and investment will help accelerate the development of this market and assure its leadership in electric motorcycles.

Outlook(1)
On January 30, 2018 the Company announced the following expectations for 2018.

The Company expects to ship between 231,000 and 236,000 motorcycles to dealers in 2018, which is down approximately 2% to 4% from 2017. The Company's shipment expectation assumes that U.S. dealer retail sales will be down, partially offset by growth in international retail sales. The Company expects 2018 year-end U.S. retail inventory to be flat to 2017 and flat to up in international markets as it continues to add new dealers.

During 2018, the Company expects retail sales to be positively impacted by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• Increased focus and investment on growing global ridership

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• New product momentum with model-year 2018 motorcycles and the addition of new high-impact models yet to be introduced

- -----------------------------------------------------
• A rebound in emerging-market retail sales performance

- ---------------------------------------------
• Expansion of the international dealer network

However, these positive impacts are expected to be more than offset by strong headwinds including:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A very weak U.S. industry for new motorcycles driven by flat to declining total demand for combined new and used motorcycles and soft, but improving, Harley-Davidson used motorcycle prices

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Competitive pressure from continued new product introductions throughout markets globally, particularly in lower price, smaller displacement motorcycles

Operating income as a percent of revenue for the Motorcycles segment is expected to be approximately 9.5% to 10.5% for the full year 2018. This reduction of approximately 2 to 3 percentage points compared to 2017, is primarily due to expected manufacturing optimization plan costs of $120 to $140 million. Also, operating margin will be reduced by approximately 0.2 percentage points due to the adoption of an accounting standard update that will require the Company to present the non-service cost components of its pension and postretirement plan expense as non-operating income. The Company estimates this will result in approximately $10 million of non-operating income in 2018 that would have been included in operating income under existing accounting standards. The new presentation will be applied retrospectively to prior periods in the Company's results for 2018 and forward.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2018 is expected to benefit from pricing on model-year 2018 and 2019 motorcycles, a more favorable foreign currency exchange environment than 2017 and positive mix. However, the Company expects these positive impacts to be more than offset by rising steel and aluminum costs and increased manufacturing expense.

Manufacturing expense is expected to be higher than in 2017, due in part to increased depreciation from recent capital investments related to the new model-year 2018 Softail motorcycles. However, the larger driver of increased manufacturing costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, will be higher costs of $20 to $25 million due to temporary inefficiencies related to the manufacturing optimization plan.

The Company expects selling, administrative and engineering expense to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017, but level with 2017 when expressed as a percent of revenue. The Company expects selling, administrative and engineering expense to be up behind increased investments in marketing and product development as the Company works to grow ridership globally.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to ship 60,000 to 65,000 motorcycles to dealers, which is down approximately 8% to 15% percent from 2017. While the Company expects U.S. retail inventory will be tighter than in the first quarter of 2017, it believes the composition of previous and current model-year motorcycles will be considerably improved from last year. The Company expects Motorcycles segment operating income as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of

24

2018 to be down approximately 5 percentage points due to approximately $57 million of restructuring expense related to the manufacturing optimization plan, lost absorption from lower production and higher selling, administrative and engineering expense as marketing and product development expenses increase.

Additionally, as the Company increases its investment in electric motorcycle technology, products and infrastructure it expects to spend an incremental $25 to $50 million per year over the next several years.

The Company expects operating income from Financial Services to be down in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower net interest income, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses.

Capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be $250 to $270 million, which includes approximately $50 million to support the manufacturing optimization plan. The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2018 with cash flows generated by operations.

Finally, the Company expects its full year effective tax rate will be approximately 23.5% to 25%, down approximately 10 percentage points from the rate that would have been expected excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance excludes the effect of potential future adjustments associated with revisions to the $53.1 million tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Act, other new tax legislation or audit settlements. Given the complexity and timing of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company has recorded the impact of the 2017 Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on reasonable estimates and considers these estimates to be provisional under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118). Future guidance, interpretations and pronouncements may add clarity to the numerous aspects of the 2017 Tax Act. This future clarification may give rise to additional unanticipated considerations and revisions to the Company’s provisional estimates related to the 2017 Tax Act included in the Company’s 2017 income tax provision. Any such adjustments will be recorded as discrete income tax expenses or benefits in future periods.

Manufacturing Optimization Plan Costs and Savings(1)

The following table summarizes the expected costs and savings associated with the Company's manufacturing optimization plan which is described in more detail in the "Overview" above. The restructuring costs relate to employee termination benefits, accelerated depreciation and other project implementation costs.

Diluted earnings per share $ 3.02 $ 3.83 $ (0.81 ) (21.1 )%

Consolidated operating income was down 15.0% in 2017 driven by a decrease in operating income from the Motorcycles segment which was down $157.4 million compared to 2016. Operating income for the Financial Services segment decreased by $0.2 million during 2017 as compared to 2016. Please refer to the “Motorcycles and Related Products Segment” and “Financial Services Segment” discussions following for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating income.
The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 39.6% compared to 32.4% for 2016. The higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act enacted in December 2017. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate beginning in 2018 from 35% to 21%; however, because the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in 2017, the Company was required to remeasure its net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. The impact of remeasuring the deferred tax asset balances combined with other adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a non-cash income tax charge of $53.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.02 in 2017, down 21.1% compared to 2016. Diluted earnings per share were adversely impacted by the 24.6% decrease in net income, but benefited from lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased from 180.5 million in 2016 to 172.9 million in 2017 driven by the Company's repurchases of common stock. Please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information concerning the Company's share repurchase activity.

In the U.S., retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were lower than in 2016 driven by ongoing industry weakness and limited availability of model-year 2018 product. The Company believes the industry for new motorcycles continued to be adversely impacted by soft used motorcycle prices, although prices did improve in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. In addition, retail sales of used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S., which the Company believes is an important indicator of overall demand for the Company's motorcycles, were up through November 2017 year-to-date. Combined retail sales of new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. were down slightly on a year-to-date basis through November 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. However, the Company's 2017 November year-to-date share of combined new and used motorcycles registered increased for the ninth consecutive year. (Source for used data: IHS Markit Used Registrations for On-Highway and Dual Purpose motorcycles with engines 601 and greater in the U.S. from 2008 through November 2017).

Strong prices for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. are key to the Company's focus on driving value for its riders, dealers and the brand. In the fourth quarter of 2017, positive momentum in used motorcycle pricing continued from the third quarter. Used Harley-Davidson motorcycle wholesale prices at auction remained above year-ago levels, and third-party pricing services continued to publish higher retail values year-over-year for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Finally, for the second consecutive quarter, dealership data in the fourth quarter indicated that prices for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the broader used motorcycle market were up in aggregate, particularly in the Harley-Davidson dealer network.

The Company's U.S. market share of 601+cc motorcycles for 2017 was 50.7%, down 0.5 percentage points compared to 2016 (Source: Motorcycle Industry Council).
International retail sales in 2017 were below expectations; however, the Company continues to believe that its strong brand, products and expanded distribution will drive growth in international markets over time. In EMEA, retail sales in Europe were down slightly from 2016 while other EMEA markets decreased 12.4% behind softness in emerging markets including Russia, Middle East and South Africa. In Asia Pacific, retail sales were down compared to 2016 on softness in Japan and Australia and lower retail sales in emerging markets compared to 2016. Retail sales in Latin America during 2017 were down on softness in Mexico partially offset by an increase in Brazil. Canada retail sales were down slightly from the prior year.

27

Despite the difficult year in international markets, there were positive developments. The Company believes its new model-year 2018 Softail motorcycles are being very well received by customers internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company experienced strong sell-through rates with limited availability throughout the quarter. The Company believes the strong customer response to the new Softail models, coupled with the fact that international retail sales generally include a greater mix of Softail models than in the U.S., is a good early indicator of the potential impact of these new models.(1) Additionally, in line with the Company's strategy to increase brand access internationally, it continued to expand the international dealer network. The Company added 57 and 40 new international dealers during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company plans to add a total of 150 to 200 new international dealerships from 2016 through 2020.(1) The Company remains committed to its long-term international growth strategy and expects to return to international retail sales growth in 2018.(1)

During 2017, wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 7.9% compared to the prior year, slightly more than the 6.7% decrease in dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. International shipments as a percentage of the total were up slightly in 2017 as compared to 2016. Shipments of Cruiser motorcycles increased as a percentage of total shipments in 2017 behind the launch of the new model-year 2018 Softail motorcycles. The Softail motorcycle platform was completely redesigned for model-year 2018 and merged the former Softail and Dyna platforms.
Dealer inventory of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. at the end of 2017 was down approximately 3,000 motorcycles compared to the end of 2016. The Company believes its supply management discipline delivered the intended results and the dealer network is well-positioned for 2018.(1)

Total (357 ) (158 ) (199 )
 2017 $ 4,915 $ 3,262 $ 1,653

The following factors affected the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from 2016 to 2017:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The decrease in volume was due to lower wholesale motorcycle shipments, as well as lower P&A and general merchandise sales. P&A and general merchandise sales were down due in large part to lower motorcycle shipments and lower retail motorcycle sales.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On average, wholesale prices for motorcycles shipped in 2017 were higher than in the prior year resulting in a favorable impact on revenue. The positive impact on revenue was partially offset by increased costs related to the additional content added to motorcycles shipped in 2017 as compared to last year.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue was positively impacted by slightly stronger weighted-average foreign currency rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, as compared to last year. In addition, cost was favorably impacted by a higher net gain resulting from the remeasurement of foreign-denominated balance sheet accounts net of losses incurred on hedging activities, as compared to last year.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Shipment mix changes resulted in a negative impact on gross profit resulting from unfavorable changes in the mix of

models within motorcycle families as well as changes in P&A product mix.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Raw material prices were higher due primarily to increased steel and aluminum costs.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Manufacturing costs were negatively impacted by lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes, higher model-year startup costs and higher depreciation.

Operating expense which consists of selling, administrative and engineering expenses, was down compared to 2016. The decrease in spending was due in large part to aggressive cost management, lower employee costs following a 2016 reorganization and the non-recurrence of related employee termination costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.

29

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $29.4 million charge associated with the previously disclosed NHTSA investigation opened in 2016 related to certain motorcycles equipped with anti-lock breaking systems. In January 2018, the Company announced a voluntary recall of model-year 2008-2011 Touring and V-ROD® motorcycles which the Company believes addresses the NHTSA investigation. Despite this charge, overall warranty and recall costs in 2017 were favorable compared to 2016 driven by lower year-over-year warranty expense.

Interest income was favorable in 2017 due to higher average retail receivables partially offset by lower average wholesale receivables and lower average yields across the portfolios. Other income was favorable due to increased licensing revenue and investment income. Securitization and servicing income was lower primarily due to a $9.3 million gain on the sale of finance receivables recognized as a result of the second quarter 2016 off-balance sheet asset-backed securitization. There was no comparable transaction in the current year.
Interest expense increased due to a higher cost of funds, partially offset by lower average outstanding debt.
The provision for credit losses decreased $4.2 million compared to 2016. The retail motorcycle provision decreased $6.5 million during 2017 as a result of a smaller increase in the retail reserve rate and lower receivables partially offset by higher retail credit losses. Credit losses were higher as a result of unfavorable performance across the retail motorcycle portfolio. The wholesale provision increased $1.0 million due to a smaller decrease in the wholesale reserve rate compared to 2016.
Annual losses on the Company's retail motorcycle loans were 1.90% during 2017 compared to 1.83% in 2016. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2017 decreased to 4.21% from 4.25% at December 31, 2016.

Consolidated operating income was down 9.2% in 2016 driven by a decrease in operating income from the Motorcycles segment which decreased by $102.1 million compared to 2015. Operating income for the Financial Services segment decreased by $4.7 million during 2016 as compared to 2015. Please refer to the “Motorcycles and Related Products Segment” and “Financial Services Segment” discussions following for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating income.

Corporate interest expense was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the issuance of corporate debt in the third quarter of 2015. The Company issued $750.0 million of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2015 and utilized the proceeds to fund the repurchase of common stock in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 32.4% compared to 34.6% for 2015. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily driven by the successful closure of various tax audits in 2016.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.83 in 2016, up 3.8% compared to 2015. Diluted earnings per share were adversely impacted by the 8.0% decrease in net income, but benefited from lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased from 203.7 million in 2015 to 180.5 million in 2016 driven by the Company's repurchases of common stock. Please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information concerning the Company's share repurchase activity.

Worldwide independent dealer retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles decreased 1.6% during 2016 compared to 2015. Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles decreased 3.9% in the United States and increased 2.3% internationally in 2016. The Company believes its spending to drive demand mitigated the effects of the intense global competitive environment, including the expanded price gaps to the competition in the U.S. and the impact of new product introductions. For example, the positive response to its Milwaukee-EightTM engine drove significantly improved touring motorcycle sales and U.S. Harley-Davidson market share gains in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The Company believes 2016 U.S. retail sales of its motorcycles were negatively impacted by intense competitive activity behind discounting and new competitor products. The Company believes the U.S. industry was also adversely affected by weakness in oil-dependent areas and soft used motorcycle values, compounded by economic uncertainty. The Company also believes 2016 retail sales in the U.S. were negatively impacted by lower wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the fourth quarter. The Company's shipments of its model-year 2017 motorcycles were limited during the fourth quarter as U.S. dealers focused on selling model-year 2016 motorcycles.
The Company's U.S. market share of 601+cc motorcycles for 2016 was 51.2%, up 1.0 percentage point compared to 2015 (Source: Motorcycle Industry Council). The Company believes its U.S. market share growth was driven by its demand driving spending focused on growing product awareness and ridership and the favorable response to its model-year 2016 S-model cruisers and its new model-year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-EightTM engine.

In EMEA, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles for 2016 increased 5.9% compared to the prior year due in part to a positive reception to its model-year 2016 S-model cruisers and its new model-year 2017 motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-EightTM engine.

In Asia Pacific, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles for 2016 increased 2.0% compared to the prior year. Overall growth in Asia Pacific was partially offset by lower sales in India and Indonesia. In India, the Company believes retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were negatively impacted by India's currency demonetization in the fourth quarter of 2016. In

32

Indonesia, retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were lower as the Company is reestablishing its dealer network in that market.

Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Latin America for 2016 decreased 13.2% compared to the prior year. The Company believes retail sales in Brazil continued to be negatively impacted by a price increase on its motorcycles initiated in the first quarter of 2016 and by a slowing economy, consumer uncertainty and aggressive price competition.

Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Canada increased 5.5% in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company believes the market responded favorably to the change to a direct distribution model implemented in July 2015 and pricing adjustments that were implemented with the model-year 2016 motorcycles.

International retail sales as a percent of total retail sales in 2016 were 37.9% compared to 36.4% in 2015.

During 2016, wholesale shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 1.6% compared to the prior year in line with the 1.6% decrease in dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. International shipments as a percentage of the total were up in 2016 as compared to 2015. In addition, shipments of Cruiser motorcycles as a percentage of total shipments increased in 2016 compared to the prior year driven by the strong acceptance of the model-year 2016 S-model motorcycles. Touring motorcycle shipments were down in 2016; however, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the shipment mix of Touring motorcycles increased reflecting the high demand for the new 2017 Touring motorcycles featuring the Milwaukee-EightTM engine. Dealer retail inventory of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. at the end of 2016 was approximately flat compared to the end of 2015.

 2016 $ 5,272 $ 3,420 $ 1,852

The following factors affected the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from 2015 to 2016:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Volume decreases were driven by lower wholesale motorcycle shipments, as well as decreases in sales of parts and accessories and general merchandise.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On average, wholesale prices on the Company’s 2016 and 2017 model-year motorcycles are higher than the prior model-years resulting in the favorable impact on revenue during the period. The impact of revenue favorability resulting from model-year price increases on gross profit was partially offset by increases in cost related to the additional content added to the 2016 and 2017 model-year motorcycles.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross profit was negatively impacted by foreign currency due to lower hedge gains, given the significant gains experienced in the prior year, and lower revenues behind a slightly stronger U.S. dollar relative to its foreign currency exposures.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Shipment mix changes negatively impacted gross profit primarily due to changes in motorcycle family mix, driven by strong customer demand for the Company's model-year 2016 S-model cruiser motorcycles, and model mix within its motorcycle families.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Manufacturing costs for 2016 were negatively impacted by higher costs related to retooling and start-up costs at its Pilgrim Road manufacturing facility associated with the Milwaukee-EightTM engine, the implementation of the Company's ERP system at the Company's Kansas City manufacturing facility and a higher fixed cost per unit due to lower volumes, partially offset by favorable costs related to parts and accessories.

Operating expense, which consists of selling, administrative and engineering expenses, was largely flat in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2016, the Company significantly increased spending on marketing and product development to drive demand.

34

However, these expense increases were mostly offset by decreases related to other items, including lower employee costs on fewer employees and lower reorganization costs. Reorganization costs, included in selling and administrative expenses, in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, were $18.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively.

Operating income from Financial Services $ 275,530 $ 280,205 $ (4,675 ) (1.7 )%

Interest income was favorable in 2016 due to higher average receivables in the retail and wholesale portfolios. Other income was favorable primarily due to increased revenue from credit card licensing, insurance and protection products and international licensing revenue. Securitization and servicing income was higher primarily due to a $9.3 million gain on the sale of finance receivables with a principal balance of $301.8 million through an off-balance sheet asset-backed securitization during the second quarter of 2016. There was no comparable transaction in the prior year.

Interest expense increased due to a higher cost of funds and higher average debt outstanding, partially offset by a lower loss on the extinguishment of a portion of the Company's 6.80% medium-term notes than in 2015.

The provision for credit losses increased $35.3 million compared to 2015. The retail motorcycle provision increased $39.8 million during 2016 as a result of higher credit losses and increases in the retail reserve rate. Credit losses were higher as a result of deteriorating performance across the portfolio, lower used motorcycle values at auction, and continued unfavorable performance in oil-dependent areas.

Annual losses on the Company's retail motorcycle loans were 1.83% during 2016 compared to 1.42% in 2015. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2016 increased to 4.25% from 3.78% at December 31, 2015.

Other Matters

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards that will become effective for the Company in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company’s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Finance Receivables – The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables portfolio.
The retail portfolio consists of a large number of small balance, homogeneous finance receivables. The Company performs a periodic and systematic collective evaluation of the adequacy of the retail allowance. The Company utilizes loss forecast models which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss trends, origination or vintage analysis, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral, recovery rates and current economic conditions including items such as unemployment rates.
The wholesale portfolio is primarily composed of large balance, non-homogeneous finance receivables. The Company's wholesale allowance evaluation is first based on a loan-by-loan review. A specific allowance is established for wholesale finance receivables determined to be individually impaired when management concludes that the borrower will not be able to make full payment of contractual amounts due based on the original terms of the loan agreement. The impairment is determined based on the cash that the Company expects to receive discounted at the loan’s original interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent. Finance receivables in the wholesale portfolio that are not individually evaluated for impairment are segregated, based on similar risk characteristics, according to the Company’s internal risk rating system and collectively evaluated for impairment. The related allowance is based on factors such as the Company’s past loan loss experience, the specific borrower’s financial performance as well as ability to repay, current economic conditions as well as the value of the underlying collateral.
Product Warranty and Recalls – Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale and are based on a combination of historical claim cost data and other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The estimated costs associated with voluntary recalls are accrued in the period that management approves and commits to the recall. The accrued cost of a recall is based on an estimate of the cost to repair each affected motorcycle and the number of motorcycles expected to be repaired based on historical data concerning the percentage of affected customers that take advantage of recall offers. In the case of both warranty and recall costs, as actual experience becomes available it is used to update the accruals.
The factors affecting actual warranty and recall costs can be volatile. As a result, actual warranty claims experience and recall costs may differ from estimates, which could lead to material changes in the Company’s accrued warranty and recall costs. The Company’s warranty and recall liabilities are discussed further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pensions and Other Postretirement Healthcare Benefits – The Company has a defined benefit pension plan and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans, which cover employees of the Motorcycles segment. The Company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements (SERPA) with certain employees, which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the Tax Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993.
U.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in their statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans that are overfunded.

36

Pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, mortality, long-term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates.
The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high-quality long-term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the Company decreased the weighted-average discount rate for pension and SERPA obligations from 4.30% as of December 31, 2016 to 3.71% as of December 31, 2017. The Company decreased the weighted-average discount rate for postretirement healthcare obligations from 4.03% to 3.52%. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Company’s assessment of this data as of December 31, 2017, the Company set its healthcare cost trend rate at 7.00% as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of 5.00% by 2026.(1) These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods.
Plan assets are measured at fair value and are subject to market volatility. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted to reflect the current view of the long-term investment market.
Changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans resulting from the difference between assumptions and actual results are initially recognized in other comprehensive income and amortized to expense over future periods. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands):

------------------------------- ---------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------- ------- ------------------------------------------------------ --- ------ --- ------ -----

 Amounts basedon currentassumptions Impact of a 1%decrease in thediscount rate Impact of a 1%decrease in theexpectedreturn on assets Impact of a 1%increase in thehealthcarecost trend rate
2017 Net periodic benefit costs
Pension and SERPA $ 20,286 $ 27,460 $ 19,507 n/a
Postretirement healthcare $ 9,615 $ 1,162 $ 1,741 $ 1,687

Pension and SERPA $ 2,201,021 $ 358,953 n/a n/a
Postretirement healthcare $ 338,488 $ 31,824 n/a $ 11,984

This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The analysis of the impact of a 1% change in the table above does not take into account the cost related to special termination benefits. The calculation of pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes – The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These tax laws and regulations are complex and significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted into law introducing significant changes to the U.S. tax code including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In accordance with Topic 740, the Company's 2017 financial statements reflect the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act based on reasonable estimates, and the Company considers these estimates to be provisional under SAB 118. Future guidance, interpretations and pronouncements may add clarity to the numerous aspects of the 2017 Tax Act that may impact the Company. Future clarifications may give rise to additional unanticipated impacts on the Company's tax liabilities or effective tax rate and revisions to the Company’s provisional estimates related to the 2017 Tax Act included in the Company’s 2017 income tax provision. Any such adjustments will be recorded as discrete income tax expenses or benefits in future periods. The provisional amount recorded in the 2017 provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act was $53.1 million.

In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of Topic 740. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The unrecognized tax benefit is included within other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a liability for interest and penalties on exposure items, if applicable, which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly audited by tax authorities as a normal course of business. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.

Contractual Obligations
A summary of the Company’s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):

-------------------------- ------- --------- --------- ------- --------- --------- ---------- ----- --------- ------- --------- - ---------

 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter Total
Principal payments on debt $ 2,405,569 $ 2,693,007 $ 1,159,715 $ 750,000 $ 7,008,291
Interest payments on debt 160,265 182,093 79,803 366,375 788,536
Operating lease payments 15,074 23,826 14,715 8,379 61,994
 $ 2,580,908 $ 2,898,926 $ 1,254,233 $ 1,124,754 $ 7,858,821

Interest for floating rate instruments assumes December 31, 2017 rates remain constant.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company generally had no significant purchase obligations, other than those created in the ordinary course of business. Purchase orders issued for inventory and supplies used in product manufacturing generally do not become firm commitments until 90 days prior to expected delivery and can be modified to a certain extent until 30 days prior to expected delivery.
The Company has long-term obligations related to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans at December 31, 2017. The Company’s retirement plan obligations and expected future contributions and payments related to these plans are provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $72.2 million and accrued interest and penalties of $30.9 million as of December 31, 2017. However, the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for either the liability for unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining costs to accrue related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. Any amounts accrued for these matters are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information as it becomes available for each matter.

Environmental Protection Agency Notice:
In December 2009, the Company received formal, written requests for information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding: (i) certificates of conformity for motorcycle emissions and related designations and labels, (ii) aftermarket parts, and (iii) warranty claims on emissions related components. The Company promptly submitted written responses to the EPA’s inquiry and has engaged in information exchanges and discussions with the EPA. In August 2016, the Company entered into a consent decree with the EPA regarding these issues, and the consent decree was subsequently revised in July 2017 (the Settlement). In the Settlement, the Company agreed to, among other things, pay a fine, and not sell tuning products unless they are approved by the EPA or California Air Resources Board. In December 2017, the EPA filed the Settlement with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for the purpose of obtaining court approval of the Settlement. Three amicus briefs opposing portions of the Settlement were filed with the court by the deadline of January 31, 2018. The Company anticipates the court will make a decision whether or not to finalize the Settlement in the following months. The Company has an accrual associated with this matter which is included in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and as a result, if it is finalized, the Settlement would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The Settlement is not final until it is approved by the court, and if it is not approved by the court, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of any remedies the EPA might seek beyond the Company's current reserve for this matter.
York Environmental Matters:
The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties related to a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including a site-wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS).
In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy, and the parties amended the Agreement in 2013 to address ordnance and explosive waste. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement.
The Company has an accrual for its estimate of its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility which is included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While much of the work on the RI/FS is complete, it is still under agency review and given the uncertainty that exists concerning the nature and scope of additional environmental investigation and remediation that may ultimately be required under the RI/FS that is finally approved or otherwise at the York facility, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of those additional costs, if any, that may result.
The estimate of the Company's future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities.
Product Liability Matters:
The Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability suits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.(1)
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Matters:
In July 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began an investigation into certain of the Company's motorcycles equipped with anti-lock braking systems (ABS). NHTSA’s investigation is in response to rider complaints related to brake failures and applies to model-year 2008-2013 Touring and model-year 2008-2017 V-ROD® motorcycles. NHTSA noted that Harley-Davidson has a two-year brake fluid replacement interval that owners either are unaware of or ignore. During 2017, the Company estimated and recorded a $29.4 million accrual associated with the NHTSA matter which is included in accrued liabilities. On January 30, 2018, the Company announced a voluntary recall, which offers a free brake fluid flush for model-year 2008-2011 Touring and V-ROD® motorcycles. The Company believes the accrued liability it has recorded will adequately cover the cost of the recall.

39

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company participates in asset-backed financing both through asset-backed securitization transactions and through asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities. In the Company's asset-backed financing programs, the Company transfers retail motorcycle finance receivables to special purpose entities (SPE), which are considered Variable Interest Entities (VIE) under U.S. GAAP. Each SPE then converts those assets into cash, through the issuance of debt. The Company retains servicing rights for all of the retail motorcycle finance receivables transferred to SPEs as part of an asset-backed financing.
The SPEs are separate legal entities that assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the retail motorcycle finance receivables they hold. The assets of the VIEs are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Company’s creditors. The Company’s economic exposure related to the VIEs is generally limited to restricted cash reserve accounts, retained interests and ordinary representations and warranties and related covenants. The VIEs have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to investors.
The accounting treatment for asset-backed financings depends on the terms of the related transaction and the Company’s continuing involvement with the VIE. Most of the Company’s asset-backed financings do not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale for accounting purposes because, in addition to retaining servicing rights, the Company retains a financial interest in the VIE in the form of a debt security. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings. As secured borrowings, the retail motorcycle finance receivables remain on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation reflected as debt.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company sold finance receivables with a principal balance of $301.8 million into a securitization VIE. The transaction met the criteria to be treated as a sale for accounting purposes and resulted in an off-balance sheet arrangement because the Company did not retain any financial interest in the VIE beyond servicing rights and ordinary representations and warranties and related covenants. Upon sale, the retail motorcycle finance receivables were removed from the Company’s balance sheet and a gain of $9.3 million was recognized in Financial Services Revenue. For more information see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2017
Over the long-term, the Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders.(1) The Company believes the Motorcycles operations will continue to be primarily funded through cash flows generated by operations.(1) The Company’s Financial Services operations will continue to be funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities, committed unsecured bank facilities and asset-backed securitizations.
The Company’s strategy is to maintain a minimum of twelve months of its projected liquidity needs through a combination of cash and cash equivalents and availability under credit facilities. The following table summarizes the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and availability under credit and conduit facilities (in thousands):

----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ---------

 December 31, 2017
Cash and cash equivalents $ 687,521

Credit facilities (a) 291,518
Asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduit facilities (a) 620,543
Asset-backed Canadian commercial paper conduit facility (a) 491
Total availability under credit and conduit facilities 912,552
Total $ 1,600,073

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Includes facilities expiring in the next twelve months some of which the Company expects to renew prior to expiration.(1)

The Company recognizes that it must continue to adjust its business to changes in the lending environment. The Company intends to continue with a diversified funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles and to pursue a variety of sources to obtain cost-effective funding.(1) The Financial Services operations could be negatively affected by higher costs of funding and the increased difficulty of raising, or potential inability to raise, funding in the short-term and long-term capital markets.(1) These negative consequences could in turn adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital, reduced funds available through its Financial Services

40

operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers, and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital.

Cash Flow Activity
The following table summarizes the cash flow activity of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------ -------- --------- ---- -------- ---- --------- -------- - - --------- -

 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,005,061 $ 1,174,339 $ 1,100,118
Net cash used by investing activities (562,468 ) (392,731 ) (915,848 )
Net cash used by financing activities (541,803 ) (734,390 ) (354,064 )
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 26,747 (9,443 ) (14,677 )
Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (72,463 ) $ 37,775 $ (184,471 )

Operating Activities
The decrease in operating cash flow in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to lower net income, unfavorable changes in working capital and higher retirement plan contributions. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower net cash outflows for wholesale lending.
The increase in operating cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower net cash outflows from wholesale lending and favorable changes in working capital driven by a reduction in inventory during 2016. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the impact of a retirement plan contribution and lower net income.
During 2017, the Company voluntarily contributed $25.0 million to its qualified pension plan and $15.0 million to its postretirement healthcare plans. This compares to a qualified pension plan contribution of $25.0 million in 2016 and no contributions in 2015. The Company expects that no qualified pension contributions will be required in 2018.(1) The Company also expects that 2018 postretirement healthcare plan benefits and benefits due under the SERPA will be paid by the Company or funded with plan assets.(1) The Company’s expected future contributions and benefit payments related to these plans are provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(1)

Investing Activities
The Company’s investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in retail finance receivables and short-term investment activity. Capital expenditures were $206.3 million, $256.3 million and $260.0 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net cash outflows for finance receivables in 2017, which consisted primarily of retail finance receivables, were $125.8 million lower than 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in retail motorcycle loan originations during 2017. Similarly, 2016 net cash outflows for finance receivables were $125.5 million lower than 2015 primarily due to lower retail motorcycle loan originations during 2016.
Cash inflows from maturities of marketable securities were $6.9 million, $40.0 million and $11.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During 2016, the Company completed a sale of finance receivables through an off-balance sheet asset-backed securitization. The proceeds from the sale of finance receivables, which positively impacted cash flow, were $312.6 million. There were no comparable transactions in 2017 or 2015.
During 2015, the Company purchased certain assets and liabilities from Fred Deeley Imports, Ltd. resulting in a $59.9 million cash outflow. There were no business acquisitions in 2017 or 2016.

Financing Activities
The Company’s financing activities consist primarily of dividend payments, share repurchases and debt activity.
The Company paid dividends of $1.46 per share totaling $251.9 million during 2017, $1.40 per share totaling $252.3 million during 2016 and $1.24 per share totaling $249.3 million during 2015.
Cash outflows from share repurchases were $465.3 million, $465.3 million and $1,537.0 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Share repurchases during 2017, 2016 and 2015 included 8.8 million, 9.9 million and 28.0 million shares of

41

common stock, respectively, related to discretionary share repurchases and shares of common stock that employees surrendered to satisfy withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards. In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors separately authorized the Company to buy back up to an additional 20.0 million shares of its common stock with no dollar limit or expiration date of which 10.6 million shares remained available at December 31, 2017. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15.0 million additional shares of its common stock with no dollar limit or expiration date.
Financing cash flows related to debt activity resulted in net cash inflows / (outflows) of $155.5 million , ($78.3) million and $1.40 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company’s total outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- ---- --------- --------- - ---------

 2017 2016 2015

Total debt $ 6,988,009 $ 6,807,567 $ 6,872,198

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Generally, lower credit ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw the Company’s ratings based on its assessment of the Company’s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. The Company’s short-term debt ratings affect its ability to issue unsecured commercial paper. The Company’s short- and long-term debt ratings as of January 2018 were as follows:

----------------- ---------- --------- --------

 Short-Term Long-Term Outlook
Moody’s P2 A3 Stable
Standard & Poor’s A2 A- Negative
Fitch F1 A Stable

Credit Facilities – In May 2017, the Company entered into a $100.0 million 364-day credit facility which matures in April 2018. The Company also has a $675.0 million five-year credit facility which matures in April 2019 and a $765.0 million five-year credit facility which matures in April 2021. The new 364-day credit facility and the five-year credit facilities (together, the Global Credit Facilities) bear interest at variable interest rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on certain criteria, such as credit ratings. The Global Credit Facilities also require the Company to pay a fee based on the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the Global Credit Facilities. The Global Credit Facilities are committed facilities primarily used to support the Company's unsecured commercial paper program. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company renewed its $25.0 million credit facility which had expired in May 2017. The $25.0 million credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates, and the Company must pay a fee based on the unused portion of the $25.0 million commitment. The credit facility expires in May 2018.
Unsecured Commercial Paper – Subject to limitations, the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper of up to $1.54 billion as of December 31, 2017 supported by the Global Credit Facilities, as discussed above. Outstanding unsecured commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. The Company intends to repay unsecured commercial paper as it matures with additional unsecured commercial paper or through other means, such as borrowing under the Global Credit Facilities, borrowing under its asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduit facilities or through the use of operating cash flow and cash on hand.(1)

(a)    Floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus 35 bps.
The Notes provide for semi-annual interest payments and principal due at maturity.
Senior Unsecured Notes – In July 2015, the Company issued $750.0 million of senior unsecured notes in an underwritten offering. The senior unsecured notes provide for semi-annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. $450.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature in July 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.50%, and $300.0 million of the senior unsecured notes mature in July 2045 and have an interest rate of 4.625%. The Company used the proceeds from the debt to repurchase shares of its common stock in 2015.
 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed Canadian Commercial Paper Conduit Facility – The Company has a revolving facility agreement (Canadian Conduit) with a Canadian bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Under the agreement, the Canadian Conduit is contractually committed, at the Company's option, to purchase from the Company eligible Canadian retail motorcycle finance receivables for proceeds up to C$220.0 million. The transferred assets are restricted as collateral for the payment of the debt. The terms for this facility provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing market interest rates plus a specified margin. The Canadian Conduit also provides for a program fee and an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment of C$220.0 million. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the Canadian Conduit, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, as of December 31, 2017, the Canadian Conduit has an expiration date of June 30, 2018. The contractual maturity of the debt is approximately 5 years.

During 2017 and 2016, the Company transferred $105.4 million and $71.1 million, respectively, of Canadian retail motorcycle finance receivables to the Canadian Conduit for proceeds of $87.0 million and $62.4 million, respectively.
On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed U.S. Commercial Paper Conduit Facilities VIE – On December 13, 2017, the Company renewed its existing $300.0 million and $600.0 million revolving facility agreements with a third-party bank-sponsored asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduit. Availability under the revolving facilities (together, the U.S. Conduit Facilities) is based on, among other things, the amount of eligible U.S. retail motorcycle receivables held by the relevant SPE as collateral.
During 2017, the Company transferred $429.7 million of U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to an SPE which, in turn, issued $383.3 million of debt under the U.S. Conduit Facilities. The VIE did not borrow under the U.S. Conduit Facilities during 2016 and did not have an outstanding balance at December 31, 2016. The contractual maturity of the debt is approximately 5 years.
The terms for this debt provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates or LIBOR to the extent the advance is not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper plus, in each case, a program fee based on outstanding principal. The U.S. Conduit Facilities also provide for an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment of $900.0 million. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt will be reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the U.S. Conduit Facilities, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, the U.S. Conduit Facilities have an expiration date of December 12, 2018.

Asset-Backed Securitization VIEs – For all of its asset-backed securitization transactions, the Company transfers U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to separate VIEs, which in turn issue secured notes with various maturities and interest rates to investors. All of the notes held by the VIEs are secured by future collections of the purchased U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables. The U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables included in the asset-backed securitization transactions are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Company's creditors until the associated debt and other obligations are satisfied. Restricted cash balances held by the VIEs are used only to support the asset-backed securitizations.

The accounting treatment for asset-backed securitizations depends on the terms of the related transaction and the Company’s continuing involvement with the VIE. Most of the Company’s asset-backed securitizations do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a sale because, in addition to retaining servicing remain on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation reflected as debt. There is no amortization schedule for the secured notes; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related retail motorcycle finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. The secured notes’ contractual lives have various maturities ranging from 2019 to 2022.
There were no on or off-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions during 2017. During the second quarter 2016, the Company sold U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables with a principal balance of $301.8 million into an asset-backed securitization VIE, and the transaction met the criteria to be accounted for as a sale because the Company did not retain any financial interest in the VIE beyond servicing rights and ordinary representations and warranties and related covenants. Upon the sale, the retail motorcycle finance receivables were removed from the Company’s balance sheet and a gain of $9.3 million was recognized in Financial Services revenue.
For more information see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Support Agreement - The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support to maintain HDFS’ fixed-charge coverage at 1.25 and minimum net worth of $40.0 million. Support may be provided at the Company’s option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Company’s ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement.
Operating and Financial Covenants – HDFS and the Company are subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the credit facilities and various operating covenants under the Notes and the U.S. and Canadian asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities. The more significant covenants are described below.
The operating covenants limit the Company’s and HDFS’ ability to:

- ------------------------------
• assume or incur certain liens;

- -----------------------------------------------------
• participate in certain mergers or consolidations; and

- ------------------------------
• purchase or hold margin stock.

Under the current financial covenants of the Global Credit Facilities, the consolidated debt to equity ratio of HDFS cannot exceed 10.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the ratio of the Company's consolidated debt to the Company's consolidated debt and equity, in each case excluding the debt of HDFS and its subsidiaries, cannot exceed 0.70 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. No financial covenants are required under the Notes or the U.S. or Canadian asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities.
At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, HDFS and the Company remained in compliance with all of the then existing covenants.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company’s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

The retail portfolio consists of a large number of small balance, homogeneous finance receivables. The Company performs a periodic and systematic collective evaluation of the adequacy of the retail allowance. The Company utilizes loss forecast models which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss trends, origination or vintage analysis, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral, recovery rates and current economic conditions including items such as unemployment rates.

Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties.
