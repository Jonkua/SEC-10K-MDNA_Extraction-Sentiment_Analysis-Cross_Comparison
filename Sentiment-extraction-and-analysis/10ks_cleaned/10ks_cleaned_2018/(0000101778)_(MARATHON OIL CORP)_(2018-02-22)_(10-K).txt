Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Each of our segments is organized and managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• United States E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

Executive Summary
During 2017, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, transform our portfolio and manage our capital and operating costs. Through multiple financing transactions in 2017, we have reduced total debt by approximately $1.75 billion which will result in a reduction to our future annual interest expense of approximately $115 million. Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business for approximately $2.5 billion and acquired acreage in the Permian basin, including over 70,000 net acres in Northern Delaware for approximately $1.9 billion.
As discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business, which has been reflected as discontinued operations and is excluded from operations in all periods presented.
Key highlights include the following:
Liquidity and corporate financing

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ended 2017 with liquidity of $4.0 billion, comprised of $563 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $3.4 billion revolving credit facility, which was increased from $3.3 billion in July 2017. Remaining proceeds of $750 million from the sale of our Canadian business are scheduled to be received in the first quarter of 2018.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In third quarter 2017, we issued $1 billion of 4.4% senior unsecured notes due in 2027 and redeemed approximately $1.75 billion of debt due in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This offering and redemption reduced our future annual interest expense by approximately $64 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In December 2017, we redeemed $1 billion of 5.125% municipal revenue bonds due in 2037 in a refunding transaction that preserved our ability to remarket up to $1 billion of tax-exempt municipal bonds prior to 2037. This redemption reduced our future annual interest expense by approximately $51 million.

Simplifying our portfolio

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We closed on the sale of our Canadian business for approximately $2.5 billion with over $1.8 billion in proceeds received to date and $750 million to be received in first quarter 2018.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We closed on multiple Permian basin acquisitions for approximately $1.9 billion of cash on hand.

Financial and Operational results

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total 2017 net sales volumes from continuing operations are 379 mboed, including Libya, which is 10% higher compared to 2016. This includes a 12% increase in sales volumes from the U.S resource plays to 217 mboed within our United States E&P segment.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Due to improved cost structure and higher sales volumes, our production expense rate in our United States E&P segment decreased 7% to $5.57 per boe in 2017 compared to last year. In our International E&P segment, our production expense rate decreased 14% to $4.33 per boe in 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales volumes in E.G. and Libya.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Added proved reserves of 193 mmboe for a reserve replacement ratio from continuing operations of 140%.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $2.0 billion, compared to $901 million in 2016 primarily as a result of improved price realizations, increased sales volumes and lower unit production expenses.

28

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our net loss per share from continuing operations was $0.97 in 2017 as compared to a net loss per share of $2.55 last year. Included in the 2017 net loss are:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in sales and other operating revenues of over 40% to $4.2 billion primarily due to improved price realizations and increased sales volumes.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Our sales volumes from continuing operations increased 10% while production expense remained flat during 2017 as a result of improved cost structure.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased 10% to $2.4 billion due to our increase in sales volumes from continuing operations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Exploration and impairment expenses increased by $248 million to $638 million, year over year, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on proved and unproved properties primarily as a result of the anticipated sales of certain non-core international assets and due to lower forecasted long-term commodity prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Our provision for income taxes was $376 million in 2017 primarily as a result of our full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets throughout 2017 and the effects of our foreign operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of U.S. Tax Reform Legislation.

Outlook
Capital Development Program
Our $2.3 billion 2018 Capital Development Program will be over 90% allocated to our U.S. resource plays. Almost 60% of this development budget will be allocated to the high-return Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which have demonstrated step-change performance improvements while operating at scale. Approximately one-third of the development budget will be allocated to our Northern Delaware and Oklahoma assets, where the majority of drilling activity will be transitioning to multi-well pads, while continuing strategic delineation and appraisal.
Our 2018 Capital Development Program is broken down by reportable operating segment in the table below:

----------------------------------------- --------------------------- -----

(In millions) Capital Development Program
United States E&P
Eagle Ford $ 710
Bakken 590
Oklahoma 410
Northern Delaware 380

Operations
Our net sales volumes from continuing operations, including Libya, averaged 379 mboed, 345 mboed and 385 mboed for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This 10% increase in 2017 was primarily due to new wells to sales in our U.S. resource plays, our acquisitions in Northern Delaware and the resumption of sales in Libya.
The following table presents a summary of our sales volumes for each of our segments. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a price-volume analysis for each of the segments.

• Eagle Ford – Our net sales volumes were 101 mboed in 2017, 4% lower compared to 2016. We brought fewer wells to sales in 2017, while we increased well productivity through completion optimization and efficiency gains.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Bakken – Our net sales volumes were 56 mboed in 2017 compared to 54 mboed in 2016. In 2017, we improved well performance with continued application of high intensity completions. During the year, we set a new record in the Williston Basin for the highest 30-day initial production oil rate.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Oklahoma – Our net sales volumes in 2017 increased by 54% to 54 mboed compared to year ended 2016. Our activity during 2017 was concentrated in the STACK and was focused on leasehold capture, delineation drilling and infill spacing pilots.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Northern Delaware – Our net sales volumes were 6 mboed in 2017 which reflected a partial year of production following the second quarter 2017 closing of the BC Operating and Black Mountain assets. During 2017 we focused our activity on delineation and leasehold capture across our position in Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico.

(a)     Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Equatorial Guinea – Net sales volumes in 2017 were higher than 2016 as a result of the completion and start-up of our Alba field compression project in mid-2016 and lower volumes in first quarter 2016 due to a planned turnaround. Additionally, in April 2017 we received host government approval to develop Block D offshore E.G. through unitization with the Alba field.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• United Kingdom – Net sales volumes in 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily as a result of planned turn-around activity at the Brae and Foinaven complexes and the temporary shut-down of the outside-operated Forties Pipeline System during fourth quarter 2017.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Libya – While civil and political unrest has interrupted operations in recent years, our production resumed in October 2016. During December 2016, liftings resumed from the Es Sider crude oil terminal. During 2017, sales volumes and production continued, except for a brief interruption in March 2017 due to civil unrest.

Market Conditions
Crude oil, natural gas and NGL benchmarks increased in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. As a result, we experienced increased price realizations associated with those benchmarks. We continue to expect crude oil, natural gas and NGLs benchmark prices to remain volatile based on global supply and demand, which will result in increases or decreases in our price realizations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition – Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of how declines in commodity prices could impact us. Additional detail on market conditions, including our average price realizations and benchmarks for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas relative to our operating segments, follows.

(a) Average of monthly prices obtained from the United States Energy Information Agency website.

Our U.K. liquid hydrocarbon production is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Our production from the Alba field in E.G. is condensate and gas. Condensate is sold at market prices and the gas is shipped to the onshore Alba Plant. The Alba Plant extracts NGLs and secondary condensate, which have been supplied under a long-term contract at a fixed price, leaving dry natural gas. The extracted NGLs and secondary condensate are sold by Alba Plant at market prices, with our share of its income/loss reflected in income from equity method investments, and the dry natural gas from Alba Plant is supplied to AMPCO and EGHoldings under long-term contracts at fixed prices. Therefore, our reported average realized prices for condensate, NGLs and natural gas will not fully track market price movements. Because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in E.G., we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, EGHoldings and AMPCO to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances. EGHoldings and AMPCO process the gas into LNG and methanol, which are sold at market prices, with our share of their income/loss reflected in the income from equity method investments line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although uncommon, any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and re-injected into the Alba field for later production.

(a) Year ended December 31, 2016 includes sales volumes of 14 mboed on an annualized basis relating to assets sold when compared to 2017, primarily consisting of the disposition of Wyoming and certain non-operated CO2 and waterflood assets in West Texas and New Mexico in 2016.
Marketing revenues decreased $78 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily as a result of lower marketed volumes in the United States E&P segment due to non-core asset dispositions. Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period.
Income from equity method investments increased $81 million primarily due to higher price realizations from LPG at our Alba plant and methanol at our AMPCO methanol facility. Also contributing to the increase was improvement in net sales volumes primarily driven by the completion of the Alba field compression project in E.G. during the second half of 2016.
Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $331 million in 2017 from 2016. This decrease was primarily related to the sale of non-core assets in the first half of 2016 in Wyoming, West Texas and New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.
Other income increased $25 million in 2017 from 2016. This increase was primarily a result of a downward revision in U.K. estimated asset retirement costs as well as timing of abandonment activities in the U.K. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for detail about our asset retirement obligation.
Production expenses remained nearly flat during 2017 while our sales volumes from continuing operations increased. During 2017, our production expense rate (expense per boe) for United States E&P was lower primarily due to the disposition of higher cost non-core assets in Wyoming. The International E&P expense rate decreased in the year of 2017 primarily due to

33

an increase in sales volumes in E.G. and Libya, combined with lower maintenance costs in E.G.

----------------------- ---- ----- -----

($ per boe) 2017 2016
Production Expense Rate
United States E&P $5.57 $5.96
International E&P $4.33 $5.05

Marketing expenses decreased $77 million in 2017 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above.
Other operating expenses decreased $53 million compared to 2016 which included the termination payment of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling commitment in 2016.
 Exploration expenses increased $86 million during 2017 versus the comparable 2016 period, due primarily to charges taken as a result of lower forecasted long-term commodity prices and the anticipated sales of certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment. In 2017, we recorded non-cash charges of $159 million comprised of $95 million in unproved property impairments in our International E&P segment and $64 million in dry well costs related to our Diaba License G4-223 in the Republic of Gabon. Additionally, our decision not to develop the Tchicuate offshore Block in the Republic of Gabon resulted in an increase to exploration expenses of $43 million during 2017. Unproved property impairments during 2016 primarily consist of non-cash charges related to our decision to not drill our remaining Gulf of Mexico leases.
The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses:

----------------------------- ----------------------- ---- -- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016
Exploration Expenses
Unproved property impairments $ 246 $ 195
Dry well costs 77 25
Geological and geophysical 25 5
Other 61 98
Total exploration expenses $ 409 $ 323

Exploration expenses are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $216 million in 2017 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase of $176 million in the United States E&P due to a 5% increase in net sales volumes, and an increase in the DD&A rates within our U.S. resource plays. Also contributing to this higher expense was an increase of $52 million in our International E&P segment resulting from increased sales volumes due to the completion and start-up of our E.G. Alba field compression project in mid-2016, and the resumption of sales volumes and production in Libya. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense.
The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in sales volumes, reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The DD&A rate for United States E&P increased primarily due to the sales volume mix between our U.S. resource plays, and the outside-operated Gunflint field achieving first production in mid-2016. Also contributing to the increase was a reduction to the Eagle Ford proved developed reserve base in the fourth quarter of 2016. The DD&A rate for International E&P remained relatively consistent with the 2016 rate. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment.

----------------- ---- ------ ------

($ per boe) 2017 2016
DD&A rate
United States E&P $23.51 $22.49
International E&P $6.19 $6.21

 Impairments increased $162 million in 2017 from the comparable 2016 period. This increase was primarily consisting of $136 million of proved property impairments in certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment as a result of our anticipated sales and lower forecasted long-term commodity prices. Additionally, included in proved property impairments was $89 million in 2017 and $67 million in 2016, both relating to lower forecasted commodity prices in conventional properties in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico.

 See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail.
Taxes other than income includes production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $32 million in the current year as a result of increased revenue and sales volumes, and due to a reserve being established for non-income tax examinations relating to open tax years. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income:

------------------------ ----------------------- ---- -- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016
Taxes other than income
Production and severance $ 121 $ 91
Ad valorem 13 23
Other 49 37
Total $ 183 $ 151

General and administrative expenses decreased $81 million in 2017 primarily due to reduced pension settlement charges of $32 million in 2017 compared to $103 million in 2016.
Net interest and other decreased $62 million during 2017 primarily as a result of the termination of our forward starting interest rate swaps, which resulted in a gain of $47 million. Additionally, during 2017 we reduced total long term debt by approximately $1.75 billion which resulted in a reduction to our net interest and other. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $51 million in 2017 primarily due to make-whole call provisions of $46 million paid upon the redemption of approximately $1.75 billion in senior unsecured notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate from continuing operations of 83% and 79% for 2017 and 2016. In 2017, our tax expense was primarily a result of our full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets throughout 2017 and the effects of our foreign operations.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate.
Discontinued operations are presented net of tax. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information concerning our discontinued operations.

Segment income (loss) represents income (loss) from operations excluding certain items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes, attributable to the operating segments. A portion of our corporate and operations support general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. Gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments, pension settlement losses, or other items that affect comparability also are not allocated to operating segments.
The following table reconciles segment income (loss) to net income (loss):

(b) We sold our Canadian business in the second quarter of 2017. The Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented.
 United States E&P segment loss decreased $267 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher price realizations and higher sales volumes. Partially offsetting this revenue increase was an increase in DD&A and a decrease in the income tax benefit, as we did not realize a tax benefit on any net federal deferred tax assets generated in 2017 due to the full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets in the prior year.
 International E&P segment income increased $146 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher price realizations, and an increase in sales volumes in E.G. and Libya. This was partially offset by an increase in DD&A and income tax expense as a result of the increase in sales volumes.

Marketing revenues decreased $259 million in 2016 from 2015. Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate can fluctuate from period to period. The decreases are primarily related to lower marketed volumes in the United States, which were further compounded by a lower commodity price environment.
Income from equity method investments increased $30 million primarily due to higher net sales volumes in the second half of 2016 in E.G. as a result of the completion of the Alba field compression project. Additionally, a partial impairment of our investment in an equity method investee in 2015 of $12 million contributed to the increase in the current year.
Net gain on disposal of assets increased $269 million in 2016 from 2015. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.
Production expenses decreased $267 million in 2016 from 2015. United States E&P declined $238 million primarily due to lower operational, maintenance and labor costs, coupled with lower net sales volumes resulting from the impact of our non-core asset dispositions and lower activity levels. International E&P declined $29 million largely due to lower operational and maintenance costs as well as a more favorable exchange rate on expenses.
The 2016 production expense rate (expense rate per boe) for United States E&P declined primarily due to cost reductions that occurred at a rate faster than our production decline. The International E&P expense rate decreased in 2016 primarily due to reduced maintenance and project costs in the U.K. and benefited from the favorable exchange rate. The following table provides production expense rates for each segment:

----------------------- ---- ----- -----

($ per boe) 2016 2015
Production Expense Rate
United States E&P $5.96 $7.38
International E&P $5.05 $5.99

Marketing expenses decreased $255 million in 2016 from the prior year, consistent with the decrease in marketing revenues discussed above.
Other operating expenses increased $74 million primarily as a result of the termination payment of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling commitment.
 Exploration expenses decreased $648 million in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting our strategic decision to transition out of conventional exploration. In 2016, unproved property impairments primarily consisted of non-cash charges related to our decision to not drill our remaining Gulf of Mexico leases and also included certain other unproved properties in the United States. In 2015, unproved property impairments are due to changes in our conventional exploration strategy (Gulf of Mexico and the Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq), and the sale of certain properties in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as our unproved property in Colorado.
Dry well costs in 2015 included the operated Solomon exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico and our operated Sodalita West #1 exploratory well in E.G.
The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses:

----------------------------- ----------------------- ---- --- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2016 2015
Exploration Expenses
Unproved property impairments $ 195 $ 655
Dry well costs 25 212
Geological and geophysical 5 31
Other 98 73
Total exploration expenses $ 323 $ 971

Exploration expense are also discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $565 million in 2016 from the prior year primarily as a result of net sales volume decreases in the United States E&P segment, including the impact of non-core asset dispositions, and volume declines due to base declines and lower completion activity. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore, volumes have an impact on DD&A expense.
The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by field-level changes in sales volumes, reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment. The DD&A rate for United States E&P decreased primarily due to a higher proved reserve base. The DD&A rate for International E&P declined primarily due to sales volume mix changes in E.G. and the U.K. for 2016.

----------------- ---- ------ ------

($ per boe) 2016 2015
DD&A rate
United States E&P $22.49 $24.24
International E&P $6.21 $6.95

 Impairments decreased $654 million in 2016 versus 2015. Impairments in 2016 were primarily the result of lower forecasted commodity prices in conventional properties in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico, and were also the result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs. Impairments in 2015 included $340 million for the goodwill impairment of the United States E&P reporting unit, and $335 million related to proved properties (primarily in Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico) as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, and $44 million associated with our disposition of natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma.
 See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail.

38

 Taxes other than income includes production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. The decline in revenue and sales volumes during 2016 resulted in a decline of $65 million compared to 2015. The following table summarizes the components of taxes other than income:

----------------------------- ----------------------- ---- -- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2016 2015
Taxes other than income
Production and severance $ 91 $ 131
Ad valorem 23 39
Other 37 46
Total taxes other than income $ 151 $ 216

General and administrative expenses decreased $107 million primarily due to cost savings realized from the 2015 workforce reductions including corresponding severance expenses.
Net interest and other increased $46 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the increase in long-term debt in the second quarter of 2015. The components of net interest and other are detailed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 79% and a benefit of 30% for 2016 and 2015. The increase in the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance increase of $1,346 million related to our U.S. benefits on foreign taxes and other federal deferred taxes.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective income tax rate.
Discontinued operations are presented net of tax. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information concerning our discontinued operations.

(b) We sold our Canadian business in the second quarter of 2017. The Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented.
 United States E&P segment loss decreased $37 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of lower DD&A expense, production costs, taxes other than income, and exploration expense, with these expense reductions more than offsetting the lower revenues as a result of decreases in both price realizations and net sales volumes.
 International E&P segment income increased $116 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was largely due to lower exploration expenses in 2016, as our 2015 expense included costs relating to our transition out of our conventional exploration program. The remainder of the increase was due to lower production costs and DD&A as a result of lower asset retirement costs and sales mix, and an increase in income from equity method investments, partially offset by lower price realizations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into the business. In 2017, we experienced an increase in operating cash flows primarily due to improvements in the commodity price environment which resulted in an increase to consolidated average liquid hydrocarbons price realizations by over 30% to $42.59. Additionally, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business and other non-core assets resulting in net proceeds of $1.79 billion, which allowed us to be opportunistic with our high quality acquisitions in the Permian basin. Beyond the proceeds the non-core asset sales generated, the portfolio changes enhanced our profitability by disposing of higher unit cost operations and allowing for a more efficient allocation of our Capital Development Program to the higher return opportunities in the U.S. resource plays.
Steps taken in 2017 to continue our operating cash flow growth include the following actions:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Improved cost structure by reducing production expense per boe in 2017.

◦United States E&P - 7% reduction to $5.57 per boe
◦International E&P - 14% reduction to $4.33 per boe

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total 2017 net sales volumes from continuing operations increased 10% compared to 2016.

Other 2017 cash flow highlights include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Divested certain non-core assets resulting in net proceeds of $1.79 billion.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We closed on multiple Permian basin acquisitions for $1.89 billion with cash on hand.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Through multiple financing transactions we have reduced total debt by approximately $1.75 billion which will result in a reduction to our future annual interest expense of approximately $115 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expect to receive $750 million in remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business by March 1, 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expanded the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion.

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.0 billion of liquidity consisting of $563 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion available under our revolving credit facility. As previously discussed in our Outlook section, we are targeting a $2.3 billion Capital Development Program for 2018. We believe our current liquidity level and balance sheet, along with our non-core asset disposition program and ability to access the capital markets provides us with the flexibility to fund our business throughout the different commodity price cycles. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environment and our spending throughout 2018.

Cash flows generated from operating activities in 2017 were higher as commodity prices and price realizations improved compared to 2016. This increase in price realization coupled with our increased sales volumes and continued focus on cost reductions resulted in an increase to cash flows generated from operating activities.
Proceeds from the disposals of assets for 2017 are primarily a result of the disposal of our Canadian business, and proceeds from disposals of assets in 2016 are primarily from the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets, as well as the sale of certain other non-operated CO2 and waterflood assets in West Texas and New Mexico. Disposals of assets in 2015 pertain to the sale of certain of our operated and non-operated producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico as well as natural gas assets in East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma. Disposition transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Issuance of common stock reflects net proceeds received in March 2016 from our public sale of common stock. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Borrowings in 2017 are a result of the issuance of $1 billion of 4.4% senior unsecured notes due in 2027. Our 2015 borrowings reflect net proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in June 2015. Financing transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Additions to property, plant and equipment reflect a significant use of cash and cash equivalents. The following table shows capital expenditures related to continuing operations by segment and reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2017, 2016 and 2015:

acquired; see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning acquisitions.
In December 2017, we redeemed $1 billion of 5.125% municipal revenue bonds due in 2037 in a refunding transaction. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2017, we used the net proceeds of the borrowing disclosed above plus existing cash on hand to redeem $1.76 billion in senior unsecured notes resulting in a recognized loss on early extinguishment of debt of $46 million, primarily due to make-whole call provisions. In November 2015, we repaid our $1 billion 0.90% senior notes upon maturity. Financing transactions are discussed in further detail in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
During 2017, the Board of Directors approved a $0.05 per share quarterly dividend. See Capital Requirements below for additional information about the fourth quarter dividend. During 2015 we announced an adjustment to our quarterly dividend starting in third quarter 2015, with the full-year impact resulting in a decrease of dividends paid in 2017 and 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In June 2017, we extended the maturity date of our Credit Facility from May 28, 2020, to May 28, 2021. In July 2017, we increased our $3.3 billion unsecured Credit Facility by $93 million to a total of $3.4 billion. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender, as well as the borrowing options under the Credit Facility, remain unaffected by the increase and term extension. We have the ability to request two additional one-year extensions and an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $107 million, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders.  The sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit remain unchanged allowing up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively.
Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, sales of non-core assets, capital market transactions, and our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.0 billion of liquidity consisting of $563 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.4 billion available under our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter of 2018, we expect to receive $750 million in remaining proceeds from the sale of our Canadian business. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. Our corporate credit ratings as of December 31, 2017 are: Standard & Poor's Ratings Services BBB- (stable); Fitch Ratings BBB (stable); and Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Ba1 (stable). A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and result in additional collateral requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.
In December of 2017, we redeemed $1 billion of 5.125% municipal revenue bonds due in 2037 in a refunding transaction that preserved our ability to remarket up to $1 billion of tax-exempt municipal bonds prior to 2037. We may incur additional debt in order to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities, or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us.
Capital Resources
Credit Arrangements and Borrowings
At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility.
At December 31, 2017, we had $5.5 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020.
We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.

42

Asset Disposals
We closed on $1.8 billion of non-core asset sales during 2017, with the largest transaction being the disposal of our Canadian business. During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into separate agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment for combined proceeds of $53 million, before closing adjustments. We have closed on one of these agreements in 2017, and we expect the remainder of the agreements to close during 2018.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these dispositions.
Debt-To-Capital Ratio
The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 32% at December 31, 2017 and 29% at December 31, 2016.

Other Expected Cash Outflows
On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend is payable on March 12, 2018 to shareholders on record on February 21, 2018.
We plan to make contributions of up to $65 million to our funded pension plans during 2018. Cash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $6 million and $21 million in 2018.

(c) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Some contracts may be canceled at an amount less than the contract amount. Were we to elect that option where possible at December 31, 2017 our minimum commitment would be $14 million.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding requirements through 2027. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,483 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Transactions with Related Parties
We own a 63% working interest in the Alba field offshore E.G. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 60% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba field to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.
We will issue stand-alone letters of credit when required by a business partner. Such letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 aggregated $89 million, $166 million and $53 million. Most of the letters of credit are in support of obligations recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. For example, they are issued to counterparties to support firm transportation agreements and future abandonment liabilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.
We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business – Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves
We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The amount of estimated proved reserve volumes affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Refer to the applicable sections below for further discussion of these accounting estimates.

The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by our engineers and geoscientists for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which is based upon several underlying assumptions. The reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.

45

Reserve estimates are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices during the 12-month period, using the closing prices on the first day of each month, as defined by the SEC. The table below provides the 2017 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices:

--------------------------------- ---------------- -----

 SEC Pricing 2017
WTI Crude oil (per bbl) $ 51.34
Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 2.98
Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 54.39
Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 22.03

When determining the December 31, 2017 proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences.
Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing proved reserves at the end of the year. If commodity prices were to decrease by approximately 10%, below average prices used to estimate 2017 proved reserves (see table above), we would not expect price related reserve revisions to have a material impact on proved reserve volumes. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors.
Depreciation and depletion of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas producing properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. While revisions of previous reserve estimates have not historically been significant to the depreciation and depletion rates of our segments, any reduction in proved reserves, could result in an acceleration of future DD&A expense. The following table illustrates, on average, the sensitivity of each segment's units-of-production DD&A per boe and pretax income to a hypothetical 10% change in 2017 proved reserves based on 2017 production.

----------------------------- ------------------------------------------- ----- ------------------------------------------- ------------ --- ------------- - ---- - ---- -

 Impact of a 10% Increase in Proved Reserves Impact of a 10% Decrease in Proved Reserves
(In millions, except per boe) DD&A per boe Pretax Income DD&A per boe Pretax Income
United States E&P $ (2.14 ) $ 183 $ 2.61 $ (224 )
International E&P $ (0.56 ) $ 30 $ 0.69 $ (36 )

Asset Retirement Obligations
We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method or the straight line method (dependent on the underlying asset) and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs.
Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in future impairment charges or in the recognition of income. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates.
An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions.

Fair Value Estimates
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 2 – Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
Significant uses of fair value measurements include:

- --------------------------------------------
• impairment assessments of long-lived assets;

- ---------------------------------------
• impairment assessments of goodwill; and

- -----------------------------------------
• recorded value of derivative instruments.

The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our Capital Development Program, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located.
Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2017 lower forecasted long-term commodity prices and the anticipated sales of certain non-core proved properties in our International E&P segment triggered an assessment of certain of our long-lived assets related to oil and gas producing properties for impairment. We estimated the fair values using an income and market approach and recognized impairments. As of December 31, 2017 our estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to our remaining long-lived assets significantly exceeded their carrying values. Long-lived assets most at risk for future impairment had estimated undiscounted cash flows that exceeded their $66 million carrying value by $22 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the related fair value measurements.

47

Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital development programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts.

We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs.
Impairment Assessments of Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments, of which only International E&P includes goodwill. We performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2017 for the International E&P reporting unit and no impairment was required. As of the date of our last goodwill impairment assessment, our International E&P reporting unit fair value exceeded its book value by over 40%.
 We estimate the fair values of our International E&P reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The market approach referenced observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value, and valuation multiples of us and our peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows, which are based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long lived assets and are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in such assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill.
Derivatives
We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes.
Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. We provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform Legislation"), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. We expect that certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation will positively impact our future after-tax earnings in the U.S., primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The Tax Reform Legislation is a comprehensive bill containing several other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to have a material effect on our results. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding Tax Reform Legislation.
We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting standards, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets, to the expected realizable amount, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity.
We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. These assumptions are described in further detail above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures.
Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, as of December 31, 2017, we reflect a valuation allowance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $926 million against our gross deferred tax assets of $2.0 billion in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gross deferred tax assets consist primarily of federal U.S. operating loss carryforwards of $898 million, which will expire in 2035, 2036 and 2037. Since December 31, 2016, we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets. If objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as forecasted projections of taxable income in future years, we would adjust the amount of the federal deferred tax assets considered realizable and reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of adjustment.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;

- ---------------------------------------------
• the expected long-term return on plan assets;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and

- -----------------------------
• health care cost projections.

We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a

49

review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary's discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, only non-callable bonds are included and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group.
Of the assumptions used to measure obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. The hypothetical impacts of a 0.25% change in the discount rates of 3.55% for our U.S. pension plans and 3.54% for our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans is summarized in the table below:

--------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------- -- ------------------------------------------- ---------- - ------- - - - -

 Impact of a 0.25% Increase in Discount Rate Impact of a 0.25% Decrease in Discount Rate
(In millions) Obligation Expense Obligation Expense
U.S. pension plans $ (4 ) $ — $ 4 $ —
Other U.S. postretirement benefit plans $ (5 ) $ — $ 5 $ —

The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan's asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 55% equity and 45% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Decreasing the 6.50% asset rate of return assumption by 0.25% would not have a significant impact on our defined benefit pension expense.
Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification).

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

We have material legal, regulatory and contractual obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. A liability equal to the fair value of such obligations and a corresponding capitalized asset retirement cost are recognized on the balance sheet in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method or the straight line method (dependent on the underlying asset) and the discounted liability is accreted over the period until the obligation is satisfied, the impacts of which are recognized as DD&A in the consolidated statements of income. In many cases, the satisfaction and subsequent discharge of these liabilities is projected to occur many years, or even decades, into the future. Furthermore, the legal, regulatory and contractual requirements often do not provide specific guidance regarding removal practices and the criteria that must be fulfilled when the removal and/or restoration event actually occurs.
Estimates of retirement costs are developed for each property based on numerous factors, such as the scope of the dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, type of production and processing structures, depth of water (if applicable), reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available dismantlement and restoration procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rates are then applied to estimate the fair values of the obligations. To the extent these or other assumptions change after initial recognition of the liability, the fair value estimate is revised and the recognized liability adjusted, with a corresponding adjustment made to the related asset balance or income statement, as appropriate. Changes in estimated asset retirement obligations for late life assets could result in future impairment charges or in the recognition of income. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates.
An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions.

Fair Value Estimates
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

Valuation techniques See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
Significant uses of fair value measurements include:

- --------------------------------------------
• impairment assessments of long-lived assets;

- ---------------------------------------
• impairment assessments of goodwill; and

- -----------------------------------------
• recorded value of derivative instruments.

The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located.
Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets in use are assessed for is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2017 lower forecasted long-term commodity prices and the anticipated sales of the fair values using an income and market approach and recognized impairments. As of December 31, 2017 our estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to our remaining long-lived assets significantly exceeded their carrying values. Long-lived assets most at risk for future impairment had estimated undiscounted cash flows that exceeded their $66 million carrying value by $22 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the related fair value measurements.

47

 Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts.

We base our fair value estimates on projected financial affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs.
Impairment Assessments of Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the by over 40%.
 We estimate the fair values of our International E&P reporting unit using a combination of market and income approaches. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill.
Derivatives
We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes.
Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("]:
Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

["), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. We expect that certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation will positively impact our future after-tax earnings in the U.S., primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The Tax Reform Legislation is a comprehensive bill containing several other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to have a material effect on our results. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding Tax Reform Legislation.
We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting standards, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets, to the expected realizable amount, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity.
We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. These assumptions are described in further detail above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures.
Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, as of December 31, 2017, we reflect a valuation allowance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $926 million against our gross deferred tax assets of $2.0 billion in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our gross deferred tax assets consist primarily of federal U.S. operating loss carryforwards of $898 million, which will expire in 2035, 2036 and 2037. Since December 31, 2016, we have maintained a full valuation allowance on our net federal deferred tax assets. If objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as forecasted projections of taxable income in future years, we would adjust the amount of the federal deferred tax assets considered realizable and reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of adjustment.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;

- ---------------------------------------------
• the expected long-term return on plan assets;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and

- -----------------------------
• health care cost projections.

We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a

Executive Summary
During 2017, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, transform our portfolio and manage our capital and operating costs. Through multiple financing on the sale of our Canadian business for approximately $2.5 billion and acquired acreage in the Permian basin, including over 70,000 net acres in Northern Delaware for approximately $1.9 billion.
As discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business, which has been reflected as discontinued operations and is excluded from operations in all periods presented.
Key highlights include the following:
Liquidity and corporate financing

Market Conditions
Crude oil, natural gas and NGL benchmarks increased in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. As a result, we experienced increased price realizations associated with those benchmarks. We continue to expect crude oil, natural gas and NGLs benchmark prices to remain volatile based on global supply and demand, which will result in increases or decreases in our price realizations.

Marketing revenues decreased $78 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily as a result of lower marketed volumes in the United States E&P segment due to non-core flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period.
Income from equity method investments increased $81 million primarily due to higher price realizations from LPG at our Alba plant and methanol at our AMPCO methanol facility. Also contributing to the increase was improvement in net sales volumes primarily driven by the completion of the Alba field compression project in E.G. during the second half of 2016.
Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $331 million in 2017 from 2016. This decrease was primarily related to the sale of non-core assets in the first half of 2016 in Wyoming, West Texas and New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.
Other income increased $25 million in 2017 from 2016. This increase was primarily a result of a downward revision for detail about our asset retirement obligation.
