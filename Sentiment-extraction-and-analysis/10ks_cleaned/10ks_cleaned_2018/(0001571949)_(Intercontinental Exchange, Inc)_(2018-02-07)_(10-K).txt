ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer end-to-end data services and solutions to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world across all major asset classes.
Our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and market data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.
Recent Developments
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to revalue our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the TCJA and to include the rate change effect in the tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $764 million deferred tax benefit based on a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017. This significantly reduced the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the effective tax rates for the last two comparable periods. As part of U.S. international tax reform, the TCJA imposes a transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non-U.S. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits. As we are in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for U.S. tax purposes, we are not liable for the transition tax. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” below.
Divestiture of Trayport and the Acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy
On December 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. Trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, OTC brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets.
The CMA undertook a review of our acquisition of Trayport under the merger control laws of the U.K. In October 2016, the CMA issued its findings and ordered a divestment of Trayport to remedy what the CMA determined to be a substantial lessening of competition. In November 2016, we filed an appeal with the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, or the CAT, to challenge the CMA’s decision. In March 2017, the CAT upheld the CMA decision that we should divest Trayport. Following the CAT’s judgment, we asked for leave to appeal the CAT’s decision at the U.K. Court of Appeals. In May 2017, the U.K. Court of Appeals denied our request for leave to appeal and we were obligated to sell Trayport by January 2018.

On December 14, 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income within our Data and Listings segment in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net gain is equal to the $733 million in gross proceeds received less the adjusted carrying value of Trayport’s net assets of $607 million (which is equal to the $531 million carrying value of Trayport plus $76 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation) and less $16 million in costs to sell Trayport.
The gross proceeds included a combination of £350 million ($466 million) in cash and £200 million ($267 million) in value relating to our acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of TMX Group. Trayport was included in our Data and Listings segment and NGX and Shorcan Energy are included in our Trading and Clearing segment. NGX, headquartered in Calgary, provides electronic execution, central counterparty clearing and data services to the North American natural gas, electricity and oil markets. Shorcan Energy offers brokerage services for the North American crude oil markets.
The functional currency of Trayport was the pound sterling, as this was the currency in which Trayport operated. The $620 million in Trayport net assets were recorded on our December 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we translated the Trayport net assets into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling affected the value of the Trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. As a result of the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to the Trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $76 million. In connection with the divestiture on December 14, 2017, the $76 million in the Trayport foreign currency translation loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized as part of the net gain on the divestiture as discussed above.
As of June 30, 2017, we classified Trayport as held for sale and ceased depreciation and amortization of the property and equipment and other intangible assets. Subsequent to its divestiture on December 14, 2017, there are no longer any Trayport assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.
Acquisition of BondPoint
On January 2, 2018, we acquired 100% of BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a leading provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms.
Investment in Euroclear
On October 24, 2017, we acquired a 4.7% stake in Euroclear for €275 million in cash ($327 million based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.1903 as of October 24, 2017). During December 2017, we reached an agreement to buy an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for €243 million in cash ($292 million based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of December 31, 2017) and expect to receive necessary regulatory approval during the first quarter of 2018. Upon closing, we will own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of €518 million ($619 million based on the exchange rates above). Euroclear is a leading provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes.
Acquisition of Global Research Division’s Index Business from BofAML
On October 20, 2017, we acquired BofAML’s Global Research division’s index business. BofAML indices are the second largest group of fixed income indices as measured by AUM globally. The AUM benchmarked against our combined fixed income indices is nearly $1 trillion, and the indices have been re-branded as the ICE BofAML indices.
Purchase of Minority Interests
During June 2017, we purchased both N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie’s, or Gasunie, 21% minority ownership interest in ICE Endex and ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V.’s, or ABN AMRO Clearing, 25% minority ownership interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. Subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from several non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. See “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)” below.

Divestiture of NYSE Governance Services
On June 1, 2017, we sold NYSE Governance Services to Marlin Heritage, L.P. NYSE Governance Services provides governance and compliance analytics and education solutions for organizations and their boards of directors through dynamic learning solutions. We recognized a net loss of $6 million on the divestiture of NYSE Governance Services, which was recorded as amortization expense within our Data and Listings segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Acquisition of TMX Atrium
On May 1, 2017, we acquired 100% of TMX Atrium, a global extranet and wireless services business, from TMX Group. TMX Atrium provides low-latency access to markets and market data across 12 countries, more than 30 major trading venues, and ultra-low latency wireless connectivity to access markets and market data in the Toronto, New Jersey and Chicago metro areas. The wireless assets consist of microwave and millimeter networks that transport market data and provide private bandwidth. TMX Atrium is now part of ICE Data Services and is being integrated with our connectivity services.
Divestiture of Interactive Data Managed Solutions
On March 31, 2017, we sold Interactive Data Managed Solutions, or IDMS, a unit of Interactive Data, to FactSet. IDMS is a managed solutions and portal provider for the global wealth management industry. There was no gain or loss recognized on the sale of IDMS.
Cetip Investment Gain
Until March 29, 2017, we held a 12% ownership interest in Cetip, which we classified as an available-for-sale long-term investment. On March 29, 2017, Cetip and BM&FBOVESPA S.A. finalized a merger agreement. BM&FBOVESPA S.A., which changed its name to B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcao, or B3, following the merger with Cetip, is a stock exchange and operator of registration, clearing, custodial and settlement services for equities, financial securities, indices, rates, commodities and currencies and is located in São Paulo, Brazil. The merger valued our Cetip investment at $500 million. We received the proceeds in cash and in B3 common stock.
The cash component was valued at $319 million, which was subject to Brazilian capital gains tax of $28 million that was remitted to the Brazilian tax authorities in March 2017. We received net cash proceeds in April 2017 of $286 million, which is net of a foreign exchange loss of $6 million that was incurred in April 2017. We received 29,623,756 B3 common shares valued at their quoted market price of $181 million. In April 2017, we sold the B3 common shares for net proceeds of $152 million, which is net of a capital gain tax of $26 million that was remitted to the Brazilian tax authorities and further transaction expenses of $3 million that were incurred in April 2017. We used the $438 million in net cash and stock proceeds received from the merger and sale of B3 shares to pay down amounts outstanding under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and for share repurchases.
The $500 million fair value of our investment in Cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of $176 million, based on the $324 million cost basis. In connection with the sale of our equity investment in Cetip, the $176 million accumulated unrealized gain was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and was recognized in other income as a realized investment gain in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the Cetip investment gain.
Acquisition of National Stock Exchange
On January 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of National Stock Exchange, Inc., now named NYSE National. The acquisition gives the NYSE Group a fourth U.S. exchange license. NYSE National is distinct from NYSE Group’s three listings exchanges because NYSE National will only be a trading venue and will not be a listings market. NYSE Group’s three listings exchanges, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, have unique market models designed for corporate and ETF issuers. After closing the transaction, NYSE National ceased operations on February 1, 2017. Subject to regulatory approvals, NYSE Group anticipates re-launching operations on NYSE National, Inc. in the second quarter of 2018.

• Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and to a lesser extent, revenue increases in our exchange-related data services and Brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing. We recognized $1.1 billion in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in Interactive Data and Trayport data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. The increase in revenues includes $59 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating expenses decreased $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating expenses increased $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased operating expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $33 million relating to the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in September 2016. Excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we recognized $812 million in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in Interactive Data and Trayport operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Also partially offsetting the operating expense increases were favorable foreign exchange effects of $40 million arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments” above.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The lower effective tax rates and income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.S. income tax rate reductions of $764 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities of $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” below.

Business Environment and Market Trends
Our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ rising demand for speed, data capacity and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies.
Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business. Changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. For additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see Item 1(A) “- Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. Many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented on January 3, 2018 are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have

44

not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
In recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients’ activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.
Many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. We contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. In addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.

Segment Reporting
We operate two business segments: our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment. This presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. Our Trading and Clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. Our Data and Listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. Our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below.
While revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. Because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. We have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. Accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.
Certain prior year’s segment expenses for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year’s segment financial statement presentation. This reclassification increased the operating expenses for the Data and Listings segment by $55 million, while decreasing the operating expenses for the Trading and Clearing segment by the same amount.

Transaction and Clearing Revenues
Overview
Our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
Rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 20%, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $749 million, $674 million and $563 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
Commodities Markets
We operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ICE Brent, ICE WTI and ICE Gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 500 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts and other key price benchmarks. The ICE Brent crude contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ICE Gasoil is a key refined

47

oil benchmark in Europe and Asia. Total oil volume and revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Crude oil revenues grew at a slightly lower rate due to customer and product mix.
In 2017, ICE Brent crude futures and options contracts were traded at record levels for the twenty-first consecutive year. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 16% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ICE Brent crude and ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy.
Our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 1% and revenues decreased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, respectively, and volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively. Global natural gas revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation in our European natural gas products. Global natural gas volume declined in 2016 primarily due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix.
Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. The increases in agricultural volume in 2016 were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels.
Financial Markets
Interest rates and other financial futures and options volume and revenues increased 15% and 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Interest rate futures and options volume increased in 2017 primarily due to expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2017, and volume increased in 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the U.K.’s decision to exit the EU. Interest rate futures and options revenues increased less than traded volumes in 2017 and in 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels.
Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 compared to the prior year. Cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $196 million, $223 million and $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Equity options volume decreased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $90 million, $98 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility in 2017 and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. While revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from NYSE American Options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.
CDS clearing revenues were $113 million, $107 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.9 trillion, respectively. Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe.
CDS trade execution revenues were $27 million, $36 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. The

48

decrease in the CDS trade execution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our U.S. and U.K. CDS voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016.
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $6 million breakup fee received in the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with Euronext, under which ICE Clear Netherlands was to provide clearing of Euronext’s financial and commodity derivatives.

Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open — in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. The following charts and table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for

Handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.
For NYSE cash equities, market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark pools. For NYSE equity options, market share decreased due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.
Transaction-Based Expenses
Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. Activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted SEC Section 31 fees was $128 million.
We also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market

51

for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.
Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin
Our Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses decreased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and decreased $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the 2016 decrease being partially offset by the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in September 2016). See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.
Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 63%, 61% and 56% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.
Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $712 million, $715 million and $809 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 67%, 66% and 61% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Data and Listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ICE Data Services. Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of market data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops, connectivity and market data. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 10%, 12% and 4%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015.
Data Services Revenues
Our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. We also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. Our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, ETFs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of indices and benchmarks.
Our exchange data revenues primarily represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity on our exchanges, which is driven by the products and technology we develop to deliver real-time views of markets and related information. In our derivatives markets, exchange data revenues relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves, and end of day reports.
We also earn exchange data revenues relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data services. We collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data

53

products. Consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last trade prices and quotes in NYSE-listed, NYSE American-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.
Our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity solutions. These include trading applications, desktop solutions, data feeds and infrastructure to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. Our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. Through our consolidated feeds, clients receive market data from global exchanges, trading venues, news and data sources for exchange-traded and OTC markets. Our services offer clients a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides access to global exchanges and content service providers. Our infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data, and facilitates low latency, secure electronic market access.
Our data services revenues increased the last two years primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, the development of new and enhanced products serving the need for an expanded range of data, regulatory compliance and analytics solutions, and our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport in December 2015 and of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis in October 2016. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestitures of IDMS and Trayport in our desktop and connectivity business. We recognized $1.1 billion in data services revenues for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for Interactive Data and Trayport from the comparable period in 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates.
Organic Annual Subscription Value
Organic Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding twelve months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that twelve-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. ASV is adjusted for material acquisitions, divestitures or discontinued businesses to provide an organic view of comparable performance on a year over year basis at a beginning of the quarter. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next twelve months of data services revenues.
As of December 31, 2017, ASV was $1.8 billion, a 6% increase compared to ASV of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. Underpinning this growth is strength in both our pricing and analytics business and our connectivity services.
Listings Revenues
We recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the U.S. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year, and generally received as cash in the first quarter of the year.
In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.
Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin
Our Data and Listings segment operating expenses decreased $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $834 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. The increase in 2016 primarily relates to $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the comparable period in 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). See “- Consolidated Operating

54

Expenses” below for further details on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses and for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses.
Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $287 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Data and Listings segment operating margins were 41%, 37% and 47% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases in 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.
Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $556 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $720 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 49% and 56% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Consolidated Operating Expenses
The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance, as discussed below. The following chart and table present our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):

----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- --- ----------------------- ----- ---- ---- -- ------ - ----- - - ----- -- -

 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 Change

Selling, general and administrative 155 116 34 116 116 —
Depreciation and amortization 535 610 (12 ) 610 374 63
Total operating expenses $ 2,250 $ 2,332 (3 )% $ 2,332 $ 1,588 47 %

55

We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 14%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
Compensation and Benefits Expenses
Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.
As of December 31, 2017 we had 4,952 employees, compared to 5,631 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 5,549 employees as of December 31, 2015. Our employee headcount decreased as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by the acquisitions of NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. Our employee headcount increased as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily due to acquisitions of Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, Interactive Data and Trayport during 2016 and 2015, converting contractor roles to employees at NYSE, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. See “- Recent Developments” above.
Compensation and benefits expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the increases in our employee headcount. We recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
We recorded $17 million, $33 million and $20 million in NYSE and Interactive Data employee severance costs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. In addition, we incurred non-acquisition-related employee severance costs of $21 million, $10 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $135 million, $123 million and $111 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans, and the increase in 2016 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
Professional Services Expenses
This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
Professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016 and 2015. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE is a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015.
Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs
We incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of

56

BondPoint, TMX Atrium, BofAML indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
We incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., owner of Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc., or collectively MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. As of December 31, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs in the future.
We incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport and the integration of NYSE. Of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to the acquisition costs. We incurred $42 million for NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Technology and Communication Expenses
Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
Technology and communications expenses increased the last two years primarily due to technology expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. In addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.
Rent and Occupancy Expenses
This expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
The increase in rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to rent and occupancy expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis subsequent to their acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
This expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries during the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the ongoing investigations and inquiries. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $272 million, $323 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. The increase in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to amortization expenses recorded on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis intangible assets, following their acquisitions.
In addition, we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see “- Recent Developments” above), and we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. In August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. In connection with the divestiture of the voice brokerage business, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million.
We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $257 million, $254 million and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the increase in 2016 primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis.

Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)
Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):

--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ---- -- ----------------------- ---- ---- ---- -- ------ - ---- - --- --- - -- -

 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 Change
Other income (expense):
Interest expense $ (187 ) $ (178 ) 5 % $ (178 ) $ (97 ) 83 %
Other income, net 325 40 n/a 40 — n/a
Total other income (expense), net $ 138 $ (138 ) n/a $ (138 ) $ (97 ) 42 %

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $ (28 ) $ (27 ) 5 % $ (27 ) $ (21 ) 28 %

Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to the $1.0 billion in senior notes issued in August 2017, partially offset by the repayment of $850 million of the 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE Notes, in September 2017. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the Interactive Data acquisition in December 2015. See “- Debt” below.
On December 14, 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments - Divestiture of Trayport and the Acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy” above.
In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and we recognized $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments - Cetip

58

Investment Gain” above. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million, $17 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We no longer receive any dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.
 We account for our investments in MERS and The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, as equity method investments. We recognized $36 million, $25 million and $6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income.
We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.
We recognized interest income on our investments of $8 million, $3 million and $6 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded as other income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense.
For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, non-controlling interest included those related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ICE Endex in which Gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ICE Clear Netherlands in which ABN AMRO Clearing held a 25% ownership interest. For both ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands, in addition to the non-controlling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income, we reported redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company.
During June 2017, we purchased both Gasunie’s 21% minority ownership interest in ICE Endex and ABN AMRO Clearing’s 25% minority ownership interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. Subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from several non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017.

Consolidated Income Tax Provision
Consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $(25) million, $580 million and $358 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate was (1)%, 29% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable U.S. and U.K. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the U.K. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the U.S.
 During the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. reduced their corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and to 18% effective April 1, 2020. During the third quarter of 2016, the U.K. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective April 1, 2020. During December 2017, the TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. See “- Recent Developments” above. The reduction in U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. The impact of the deferred tax benefits for the U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 lowered the effective tax rates by 30%, 2% and 4%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million, $34 million and $60 million, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future U.S. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the U.K. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an Illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher U.S. mix of income in 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus U.S. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future U.K. income tax rate reductions, and greater favorable settlements with

59

various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.

Quarterly Results of Operations

(1) The increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” above.
(2) Other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes a $110 million gain on our sale of Trayport, and for the three months ended March 31, 2017, includes a $176 million realized investment gain in connection with the sale of our investment in Cetip. See “- Recent Developments” above.
(3) The decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future U.S. income tax reductions, the decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture, and the decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to a deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.

We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our technology platforms that support our businesses. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below.
Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $409 million, primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in Cetip, the sale of Trayport and cash flows from operations, partially offset by acquisitions and investments we made in 2017. See “- Debt” below.
See “- Recent Developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during the year ended December 31, 2017. These cash acquisitions and investments were funded from borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program, cash flows from operations and a portion of the proceeds received from our divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. See “- Debt” below.
Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $535 million and $407 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had $1.0 billion and $943 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $432 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2016 (relating to our investment in Cetip, which was sold in 2017). We consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are

61

not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
As of December 31, 2017, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $325 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the U.S., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. Such dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal tax under the TCJA and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations, guidance and regulations concerning U.S. tax reform. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further U.S. tax reform developments.
Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 14,966,616 shares, 902,920 shares and 14,343,845 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $949 million, $50 million and $660 million, respectively. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. These repurchases were completed on the open market and under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. In connection with our acquisition of Interactive Data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. Our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. The factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
In August 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. In September 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that becomes effective as of January 1, 2018. We expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our Commercial Paper Program.
Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. We have entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.
Cash Flow
The following presents the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):

62

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------ - ----- ------ - - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 2,085 $ 2,149 $ 1,311
Investing activities 92 (860 ) (3,004 )
Financing activities (1,971 ) (1,462 ) 1,976
Effect of exchange rate changes 12 (24 ) (14 )
Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 218 $ (197 ) $ 269

The FASB has issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-18 and reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities to the total change in beginning-of-year and end-of-year total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This new standard is a change in cash flow statement presentation only. Refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital.
The $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in September 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in September 2016. The pension contribution in September 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. For additional information on our pension plan, refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015).
Investing Activities
Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from divestitures, net cash received from the sale of our investment in Cetip, purchases of cost and equity method investments, proceeds from term deposits, and changes in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $423 million, $425 million and $3.8 billion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, primarily relating to the NGX, Shorcan Energy, BofAML indices and TMX Atrium acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, and the Interactive Data acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015. We received cash from our divestitures of $761 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, relating to the sales of Trayport, IDMS and NYSE Governance Services. We received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in Cetip of $438 million. We made purchases of cost and equity method investments of $327 million, $70 million and $60 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to our investments in Euroclear, MERS and OCC. See “- Recent Developments” above for more details on these acquisitions, divestitures and investments. We received proceeds from term deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of outstanding debt.
Capital expenditures were $220 million, $250 million and $190 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $137 million, $115 million and $87 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated

63

with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.
Financing Activities
Consolidated net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to $984 million in net proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offerings, $850 million in repayments of the NYSE Notes, $409 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $949 million in repurchases of common stock, $476 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $174 million in acquisitions of non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest and $88 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. See “- Recent Developments” above and “- Debt” below.
Consolidated net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to $949 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $409 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $54 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises and $50 million in repurchases of common stock.
Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to $2.5 billion in net proceeds received in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.7 billion in net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by $1.0 billion in net repayments under our debt facilities, $660 million in repurchases of common stock, $331 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $128 million for the purchase of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.

Amended Credit Facility
We had previously entered into a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with a maturity date of November 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. On August 18, 2017, we agreed with the lenders to, amongst other items, extend the maturity date to August 18, 2022, herein referred to as the Amended Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.

64

Other amendments within the Amended Credit Facility include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the step-up in the commitment fee ratings-based grid that was scheduled to take effect in April 2019, (ii) removing ICE Europe Parent Limited as a party to the credit agreement, (iii) removing the guaranty by ICE in respect of ICE Europe Parent Limited, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio to 3.50:1.00, and (v) up to two times, increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 for a period of one year following a material acquisition.
No amounts were outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. Of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Facility, $1.2 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 and $100 million is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.1 billion available under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.
Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a “base rate” plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The “base rate” equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin rate is based upon our public long-term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on LIBOR borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
The Amended Credit Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long-term debt rating. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long-term debt ratings.
Senior Notes
On August 17, 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $500 million principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due September 2022, or the 2022 Senior Notes, and $500 million principal amount of 3.10% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due September 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offering to fund the redemption of the NYSE Notes.
In November 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Interactive Data.
Commercial Paper Program
We have entered into our Commercial Paper Program, which is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
We repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in Cetip and the sale of Trayport. These repayments were partially offset by notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2017 for the cash acquisitions and investments and to repurchase our common stock. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2016 to finance part of the cash purchase price of the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Interactive Data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 with cash flows from operations.
Commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 under our Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program was 1.49% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.

65

Commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 68 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
NYSE Notes
The $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate NYSE Notes were due in October 2017. We redeemed the NYSE Notes in full in September 2017 using the majority of the proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offering.
Refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities.

Future Capital Requirements
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our Trading and Clearing and Data and Listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We currently expect to make aggregate capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $300 million and $330 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
Our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or the audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid cash dividends of $0.80 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2017 quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share, for an aggregate payout of $476 million in 2017, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. For the first quarter of 2018, we announced a $0.24 per share dividend, which is a 20% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt. We currently have a $3.4 billion Amended Credit Facility. After factoring in the $1.2 billion required to back-stop the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 and $100 million that is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments, $2.1 billion of our Amended Credit Facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “- Debt” above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
Adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts):

Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to Interactive Data and NYSE are included in non-GAAP adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. As of June 30, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs as non-GAAP

67

adjustments following this date. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the Cetip realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in Cetip, as the sale of our investment in Cetip is not part of our core business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the net gain on the divestiture of Trayport, the accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries, and the NYSE Governance Services net loss on its divestiture, as they are non-recurring items. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the Creditex U.K. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are non-recurring items. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we include as non-GAAP adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the Interactive Data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on November 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early December 2015 to the acquisition date of Interactive Data on December 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations or represent non-recurring items.
The income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-GAAP adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance.
The income tax effects of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 include tax benefits associated with the divestiture of NYSE Governance Services. The tax adjustments on U.S. tax reform mainly include the $764 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the enactment of TCJA in the last quarter of 2017, which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of U.S. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of $10 million, deferred tax expense of $12 million, and deferred tax benefits of $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million and $60 million deferred tax benefits due to U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on Singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our OCC equity method investment. Other tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period.
For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Except for certain clearing house collateral that is reported off-balance sheet, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on our clearing houses’ collateral.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $51.2 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract. This balance is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable.
We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2017, our cumulative UTBs were $115 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $35 million as of December 31, 2017. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our UTBs.
As of December 31, 2017, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
We have a 40% ownership in OCC. Under the OCC’s capital plan, the OCC shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE, which has also been excluded from the table above.

New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.

Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

69

We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $12.2 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.3 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We have identified four reporting units: our Futures reporting unit, our Data and Listings reporting unit, our Cash Equities reporting unit, and our CDS reporting unit.
Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through December 31, 2017.
We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.

In August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. After the sale and the discontinuance of the voice brokerage operations, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million. The impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the TCJA in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. The FASB Staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have not completed our analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under SAB 118.
We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

ITEM 7 (A).     QUANTITATIVE    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
Interest Rate Risk
We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of which $293 million and $272 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian

71

dollars. The remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million as of December 31, 2017, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt, of which $4.9 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $1.2 billion relates to the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $12 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program increased from 0.74% as of December 31, 2016 to 1.49% as of December 31, 2017. The increase in the Commercial Paper Program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in March 2017, in June 2017 and in December 2017 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 75 basis points to 1.50%. The Federal Reserve also signaled that they intend to continue to increase the federal fund short-term interest rate over the next several years, and if this occurs, this will continue to increase the weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

----------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ ---------------------------- - -------------- ------ ---- -- - ------ - - ------ -

Operating income $ (12 ) $ 3 $ (18 ) $ (1 )

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.

We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 15%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 14%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $3 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.

72

We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities.
We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- --- ---------------------------- ----- ----------------- ----- -- - ---

 As of December 31, 2017
 Position in pounds sterling Position in Canadian dollars Position in euros
Assets £ 829 C$ 1,654 € 145
of which goodwill represents 268 162 43
Liabilities 96 1,026 42
Net currency position £ 733 C$ 628 € 103
Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates $ 99 $ 50 $ 12

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $136 million and $345 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had net exposure of pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and euros of £733 million ($990 million), C$628 million ($500 million), and €103 million ($124 million), respectively. Based on these December 31, 2017 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $99 million, a hypothetical 10% decrease of Canadian dollar against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $50 million, and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $12 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of $209 million, ($300 million) and ($58 million), respectively, on our consolidated equity. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of December 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of December 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. The pound sterling decreased starting in June 2016 following the U.K. referendum that resulted in a vote for the U.K. to leave the EU. The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the EU and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
Credit Risk
We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements.
Clearing House Cash Deposit Risks
Our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits and delivery contracts, which were $51.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
Credit Risk
When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, CDS spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.

73

An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
Security Issuer Risk
Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
Investment Counterparty Risk
Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house.
Our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. Such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. Clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk
Each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
Impact of Inflation
We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92 ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").
