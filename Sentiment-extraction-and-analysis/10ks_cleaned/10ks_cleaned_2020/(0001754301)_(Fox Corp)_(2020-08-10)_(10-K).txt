ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Readers should carefully review this document and the other documents filed by Fox Corporation (“FOX” or the “Company”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This section should be read together with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated and combined financial statements are referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein.

INTRODUCTION

The Distribution

On March 19, 2019, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (now known as TFCF Corporation) (“21CF”) of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FOX to 21CF stockholders (other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21CF) (the “Distribution”) in accordance with the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and between 21CF and 21CF Distribution Merger Sub, Inc. Following the Distribution, 354 million and 266 million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”), respectively, began trading independently on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. In connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2019 (the “Separation Agreement”), with 21CF, which effected the internal restructuring (the “Separation”) whereby 21CF transferred to FOX a portfolio of 21CF’s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including FOX News Media (consisting of FOX News and FOX Business), FOX Entertainment, FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and Big Ten Network, and certain other assets, and FOX assumed from 21CF the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities. The Separation and the Distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018 (the “21CF Disney Merger Agreement”), by and among 21CF, The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) and certain subsidiaries of Disney, pursuant to which, among other things, 21CF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney.

Pursuant to the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company paid to 21CF a dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion (the “Dividend”). The final determination of the taxes in respect of the Separation and the Distribution for which the Company is responsible pursuant to the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures (collectively, the “Transaction Tax”) was $6.5 billion. Following the Distribution, on March 20, 2019 the Company received a cash payment in the amount of $2.0 billion from Disney, which had the net effect of reducing the Dividend the Company paid to 21CF. The Transaction Tax included a prepayment of the Company’s share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by Disney of certain assets, principally the FOX Sports Regional Sports Networks, which were sold by Disney during calendar year 2019. This prepayment was in the amount of approximately $700 million and is subject to adjustment in the future, when the actual amounts of all such tax liabilities are reported on the federal income tax returns of Disney or a subsidiary of Disney (See Note 22—Subsequent Events to the accompanying Financial Statements).

As a result of the Separation and the Distribution, which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of $5.8 billion was included in the Transaction Tax paid by the Company, FOX obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values. This resulted in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately $1.5 billion, principally over the next several years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis. This amortization is estimated to reduce the Company’s annual cash tax liability by $370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of approximately 25%. Such estimates are subject to revisions, which could be material, based upon the occurrence of future events including, among other things, a refund of the prepayment discussed above.

In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the Company’s relationship with 21CF and Disney following the Separation. These include the Separation Agreement, a tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses, employee matters, commercial arrangements and a studio lot lease (See Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “The Distribution” for additional information).

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented on a consolidated basis. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows as a standalone company, and the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 consist of the Company’s consolidated balances.

Prior to the Distribution, which occurred on March 19, 2019, the Company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis, derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21CF. The Company’s financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 are presented on a combined basis as the Company was not a separate consolidated group prior to the Distribution. These financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of 21CF’s domestic news, national sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities associated with such businesses.

The Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 include, for the periods prior to March 19, 2019, allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within 21CF prior to the Distribution and not recorded at the business unit level, such as certain expenses related to finance, legal, insurance, information technology, compliance and human resources management activities, among others. 21CF did not routinely allocate these costs to any of its business units. These expenses were allocated to FOX on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined revenues, headcount or other relevant measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21CF, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by FOX and may not reflect FOX’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the entirety of the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if FOX had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows:

 • Overview of the Company’s Business—This section provides a general description of the Company’s businesses, as well as developments that occurred either during the fiscal year ended June 30, (“fiscal”) 2020 or early fiscal 2021 that the Company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends.

 • Results of Operations—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated/combined and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed.

 • Liquidity and Capital Resources—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as a discussion of the Company’s outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of June 30, 2020. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company’s future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.

 • Critical Accounting Policies—This section discusses accounting policies considered important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in application. In addition, Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements summarizes the Company’s significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policy discussion found in this section.

 • Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements—This section provides a description of the use of forward-looking information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such information is based on management’s current expectations about future events which are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risk factors applicable to the Company.

OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS

The Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments:

 • Cable Network Programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of news and sports content distributed primarily through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies (“traditional MVPDs”) and online multi-channel video programming distributors (“digital MVPDs”), primarily in the U.S.

 • Television, which principally consists of the acquisition, marketing and distribution of broadcast network programming nationally under the FOX brand and the operation of 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the U.S. Of these stations, 18 are affiliated with the FOX Network, 10 are affiliated with MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station. The Television segment also includes Tubi, Inc. (“Tubi”), a free advertising-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) service.

 • Other, Corporate and Eliminations, which principally consists of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible Labs Inc. (“Credible”), corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance marketplace.

Cable Network Programming and Television

The cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly, with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content. Consumer preferences have evolved toward alternative offerings, such as subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) services, AVOD services, mobile and social media platforms. These changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to traditional MVPD services, and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future.

At the same time, technological changes have affected advertisers’ options for reaching their target audiences. There has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all. As consumers switch to digital consumption of video content, there is still to be developed a consistent, broadly accepted measure of audiences across the industry. Furthermore, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising.

Given these changes in technology and consumption habits, the Company believes its strength in “appointment-based” content provides the Company with a strategic advantage. FOX differentiates itself from its competitors by focusing on audiences at a meaningful scale watching premium content in real-time and by attracting sales from advertising customers who want to reach larger audiences within specified time parameters. As the share of live news and sports consumption has increased across television viewing overall from approximately 23% of all live viewership in calendar 2015 to approximately 31% in calendar 2019, FOX has strategically built one of the most-followed news and sports platforms in the country. Real-time consumption of live news and sports programming has increased approximately 6% from 2015 to 2019. FOX’s franchises are leaders in these growing categories, generating strong demand from both advertisers and traditional and digital MVPDs. As viewers increasingly move toward ad-free or delayed viewing, we believe the scale of our live audiences and premium nature of the content we deliver across our channels increasingly differentiate us from our competitors. Audiences engage with FOX’s content in real-time and, as a result, our offerings have become more valuable to distributors and advertisers, leading to higher revenues for FOX. In addition, we have expanded the distribution of our premium content across digital MVPDs. All of our key networks are offered in all major digital MVPD services and we are cultivating direct interactions between FOX brands and consumers outside of traditional linear television.

The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies, the sale of advertising on its cable and broadcast networks and television stations, maintenance, renewal and terms of its carriage, affiliation and content agreements and programming rights, the popularity of its content, general economic conditions (including financial market conditions), the Company’s ability to manage its businesses effectively, and its relative strength and leverage in the industry. For more information, see Item 1. “Business” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included herein.

33

The Company’s Cable Network Programming and Television segments derive a majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales. For fiscal 2020, the Company generated revenues of $12.3 billion, of which approximately 48% was generated from affiliate fees, approximately 43% was generated from advertising, and approximately 9% was generated from other operating activities.

Affiliate fees primarily include (i) monthly subscriber-based license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and (ii) fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. U.S. law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the Company to seek and obtain payment from traditional MVPDs who carry the Company’s broadcast signals.

Affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to MVPDs typically to facilitate the carriage of a cable network). The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Traditional MVPDs are currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company’s program services, while digital MVPDs have become an increasingly significant share of overall distribution.

Revenues are impacted by rate changes, changes in the number of subscribers to the Company’s content and changes in the expenditures by advertisers, which continue to be impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) as discussed below. In addition, advertising revenues are subject to seasonality and cyclicality as a result of the impact of state, congressional and presidential elections cycles and special events that air on the Company’s networks, including the National Football League’s (“NFL”) Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the FOX Network on a rotating basis with other networks, Major League Baseball’s (“MLB”) World Series, and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“FIFA”) World Cup, which occurs every four years (for each of women and men), and other regular and post-season sports events, including one NFL Divisional playoff game that is aired on a rotating annual basis with another network.

The most significant operating expenses of the Cable Network Programming segment and the Television segment are acquisition and production expenses related to programming, marketing and promotional expenses, and expenses related to broadcasting the Company’s programming. Marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming. Consistent with advertising revenues, sports programming and production expenses are subject to seasonality and cyclicality due to the timing of sports events as discussed above. Additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.

The Company’s advertising revenues and operating expenses are generally higher and operating cash flows are generally lower in the second quarter of each fiscal year due to the concentration of sports events in the fall, including the broadcast of MLB’s World Series and NFL and college football games.

The profitability of U.S. national sports contracts is based on the Company’s best estimates at June 30, 2020 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline materially from estimates applied at June 30, 2020, amortization of rights may be accelerated. Should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the Company may have improved results related to the applicable contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term.

Other, Corporate and Eliminations

The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations.

Other Business Developments

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the Company’s business. Weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the Company and its business partners, including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some of the Company’s advertisers (including, in particular, local market advertisers) to reduce their spending, and future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further. Depending on the duration and severity of the recession, it could lead to changes in consumer behavior, including increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to MVPD services, that adversely affect the Company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues. In addition, the Company’s business depends on the volume and

34

popularity of the content it distributes, particularly sports content. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, sports events to which the Company has broadcast rights have been cancelled or postponed and the production of certain entertainment content the Company distributes has been suspended. Although some of these sports events and productions have resumed or are expected to resume during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, there may be additional content disruptions in the future. Depending on their duration and severity, these disruptions could materially adversely affect the Company’s future advertising revenues and, over a longer period of time, its future affiliate fee revenues. To the extent the pandemic further negatively impacts the Company’s ability to air sports events, particularly MLB, NFL or college sports, it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations than the Company has experienced thus far. In addition, shifting sports schedules may negatively impact the Company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers to its sports and entertainment programming. Principally due to the impact of COVID-19, the Company’s Television segment experienced a 29% decline in advertising revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. If current trends in Television segment advertising demand continue for the entire first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company expects advertising revenue at the Television segment to decrease approximately $230 million to $250 million, or approximately 30%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2020. This is due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including continued weakness in the local advertising market in which the FOX Television Stations operate, fewer hours of original entertainment programming and fewer college football games, as well as certain comparative items including the timing of NFL games and the absence of the prior year broadcast of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, partially offset by higher cyclical political advertising and the impact of the consolidation of Tubi. If there is a significant decline in the Company’s estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming, it could lead to a downward revision in the value of, among other things, the Company’s reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets, programming rights and long-lived assets and result in a non-cash impairment charge that is material to the Company’s reported net earnings.

In April 2020, the Company acquired Tubi, an AVOD service, for approximately $445 million in cash (the “Tubi Acquisition”), net of cash acquired. Potential additional consideration, in the form of deferred consideration and unvested options, totaling approximately $45 million may be due over a three-year period following the closing of the transaction and will be recognized as compensation expense over that period. The Company financed the Tubi Acquisition principally with the net proceeds from the sale of its investment in Roku, Inc. (“Roku”), which was sold for approximately $340 million in March 2020 (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Roku” for further discussion).

In March 2020, the Company acquired three television stations (FOX-affiliate KCPQ and MyNetworkTV-affiliate KZJO located in Seattle, Washington and FOX-affiliate WITI located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) for approximately $350 million in cash from Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (“Nexstar”). As part of this transaction, the Company sold Nexstar two television stations (FOX-affiliate WJZY and MyNetworkTV-affiliate WMYT located in Charlotte, North Carolina) for approximately $45 million in cash (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Television Stations Acquisition and Divestiture” for further discussion).

On November 6, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program providing for the repurchase of $2 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company also announced that it had entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $350 million of Class A Common Stock and announced its intention to promptly repurchase $150 million of Class B Common Stock. At the same time, the Company announced that it had entered into a stockholders agreement with the Murdoch Family Trust (See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to the accompanying Financial Statements under the headings “Stock Repurchase Program” and “Stockholders Agreement” for further discussion).

In October 2019, Flutter Entertainment plc (“Flutter”) and The Stars Group Inc. (“The Stars Group”) announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share combination to create a global leader in sports betting and gaming (the “Combination”) and, in May 2020, the Combination was completed. As part of the agreement, FOX Sports received the right to acquire an approximately 18.5% equity interest in FanDuel Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter, at its market value in 2021 (structured as a 10-year option from 2021, subject to a carrying value adjustment). In May 2020, the Company invested an additional approximately $100 million in Flutter, which increased the Company’s equity interest in Flutter to approximately 3%.

In October 2019, the Company acquired 67% of the equity in Credible for approximately $260 million in cash, net of cash acquired (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Credible Acquisition” for further discussion).

** not meaningful

Overview—The Company’s revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of the NFL’s Super Bowl LIV, higher pricing and higher digital advertising revenue, including the impact of the consolidation of Tubi, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 (including a decline in the local advertising market and the postponement of live sports events), lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, the effect of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and one less NFL Divisional playoff game. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of Bento Box Entertainment, LLC (“Bento Box”) and Credible in fiscal 2020 and revenues generated from the operation of the FOX Studio Lot for third parties.

Operating expenses increased 7% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs at the Television segment, including Super Bowl LIV costs, the impact of the consolidation of Bento Box, Credible and Tubi, the recognition of a write-down of approximately $95 million related to programming rights as compared to approximately $55 million in the prior year (See Note 5—Inventories, net to the accompanying Financial Statements) and higher broadcast costs related to operating as a standalone public company. Partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses was the broadcast of fewer sports events as a result of COVID-19, fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and one less NFL Divisional playoff game.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company as compared to a partial year of allocated costs in fiscal 2019 (See Note 1—Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Basis of Presentation” for additional information), a full year of costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot for third parties, increased bad debt expense and the impact of the consolidation of Bento Box and Credible. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 were incremental equity-based compensation costs of approximately $40 million related to the grant of restricted stock units and stock options in connection with the Distribution under the Fox Corporation 2019 Shareholder Alignment Plan (See Note 12—Equity-Based Compensation to the accompanying Financial Statements).

36

Depreciation and amortization—Depreciation and amortization expense increased 22% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company following the Distribution as compared to a partial year of allocated costs in fiscal 2019 and the impact of the consolidation of Credible, Tubi and three television stations.

Impairment and restructuring charges—See Note 4—Restructuring Programs to the accompanying Financial Statements.

Interest expense—Interest expense increased 82% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 and $1.2 billion of senior notes in April 2020, partially offset by the effect of the bridge credit agreement commitment letter which was entered into in December 2017, including the write-off of unamortized costs as a result of the termination of the bridge credit agreement in March 2019 (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information).

Other, net—See Note 21—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Other, net.”

Income tax expense—The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2020 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items.

The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26% for fiscal 2019 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state taxes (See Note 16—Income Taxes to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Net income—Net income decreased 35% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to restructuring charges at the Cable Network Programming and Television segments reflecting contract termination costs related to a programming rights agreement with the United States Golf Association (“USGA”) (See Note 4—Restructuring Programs to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Fiscal 2020”), higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company, including interest expense, and lower net gains on investments in equity securities (See Note 21—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Other, net”). Partially offsetting these decreases was higher Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 17—Segment Information to the accompanying Financial Statements) at the Cable Network Programming segment and lower income tax expense.

** not meaningful

Overview—The Company’s revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across all networks, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of FOX’s inaugural season of NFL Thursday Night Football (“TNF”) and an additional NFL postseason game on the FOX Network, higher cyclical political advertising revenue due to the U.S. midterm elections at the FOX Television Stations and higher digital advertising revenue at FOX News. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network.

Operating expenses increased 13% for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including the additional NFL games, and the recognition of a write-down of approximately $55 million related to entertainment and syndicated programming rights (See Note 5—Inventories, net to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a standalone public company following the Distribution as compared to allocated costs in fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses were higher allocated costs of approximately $50 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, principally due to an increase in revenues which was the primary measure to allocate on a pro rata basis certain general corporate expenses from 21CF. In addition, fiscal 2019 includes equity-based compensation costs of approximately $15 million related to the initial grant of restricted stock units and stock options under the Fox Corporation 2019 Shareholder Alignment Plan (See Note 12—Equity-Based Compensation to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Depreciation and amortization—Depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a standalone public company following the Distribution as compared to a full year of allocated costs in fiscal 2018.

38

Interest expense—Interest expense increased $160 million for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 and the effect of the bridge credit agreement commitment letter which was entered into in December 2017, including the write-off of unamortized costs as a result of the termination of the bridge credit agreement in March 2019 (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information).

Interest income—Interest income increased $41 million for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher average cash balance and higher average interest rates.

Other, net—See Note 21—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Other, net.”

Income tax (expense) benefit—The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26% for fiscal 2019 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state taxes.

The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of (3)% for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 28% primarily due to a $607 million tax benefit which reflects the effects of the legislation in the U.S. passed on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) (See Note 16—Income Taxes to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Net income—Net income decreased 26% for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the absence of an income tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act in the prior year.

Segment Analysis

The Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.

Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax (expense) benefit. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s businesses.

Cable Network Programming (45% and 47% of the Company’s revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively)

 For the years ended June 30,
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ - ---- - ------ ------ -------------- -------- - --- - -
 2020 2019 Change % Change
(in millions, except %) Better/(Worse)
Revenues
Affiliate fee $ 3,870 $ 3,804 $ 66 2 %

Amortization of cable distribution investments 24 38 (14 ) (37 ) %
Segment EBITDA $ 2,706 $ 2,495 $ 211 8 %

Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher affiliate fee and other revenues, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in subscribers to traditional MVPDs, partially offset by an increase in digital MVPD subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of fewer sports events, including National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (“NASCAR”), MLB and Major League Soccer, and studio shows as a result of COVID-19, the effect of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) content, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenue at FOX News Media. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to higher sports sublicensing revenue and increased revenues generated from Premier Boxing Champions (“PBC”) pay-per-view events at FOX Sports and higher revenues at FOX News Media.

Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to the revenue increases noted above and lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by the postponement of live sports events as a result of COVID-19, the absence of UFC content and fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating expenses were higher sports programming rights amortization for content in the first half of fiscal 2020, including NASCAR and college football, higher costs at FOX News Media, including costs relating to newsgathering, FOX Nation and talent, and the recognition of a write-down of approximately $50 million related to sports programming rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company and increased bad debt expense.

Television (54% and 52% of the Company’s revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively)

 For the years ended June 30,

Selling, general and administrative (794 ) (662 ) (132 ) (20 ) %
Segment EBITDA $ 430 $ 470 $ (40 ) (9 ) %

Revenues at the Television segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to revenues resulting from the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February 2020 of approximately $500 million, including the post-game broadcast of The Masked Singer, higher pricing at the FOX Network, increased digital advertising revenue, including the impact of the consolidation of Tubi, and the broadcast of two additional MLB World Series games. Partially offsetting the increase in advertising revenue was the impact of COVID-19, including a decline in the local advertising market and the postponement of live sports events, lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, lower ratings at the FOX Network, fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and one less NFL Divisional playoff game. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the Company’s owned and operated television stations. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of Bento Box, partially offset by lower digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network.

Television Segment EBITDA decreased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher expenses, partially offset by the revenue increases noted above. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including Super Bowl LIV costs, the impact of the consolidation of Bento Box and Tubi, higher costs related to investments in scripted original programming and co-production arrangements with third party studios and costs related to the launch of WWE Friday Night SmackDown, partially offset by the postponement of live sports events and fewer hours of scripted original programming as a result of COVID-19, the effect of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of one NFL Divisional playoff game. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company and increased bad debt expense.

Revenues at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a full year of revenues generated from the operation of the FOX Studio Lot for third parties and the impact of the consolidation of Credible. Operating expenses increased principally due to the consolidation of Credible and a full year of costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot for third parties. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company, a full year of costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot for third parties and the consolidation of Credible.

 For the years ended June 30,
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ - ---- - ------ ------ -------------- -------- - --- - -
 2019 2018 Change % Change
(in millions, except %) Better/(Worse)
Revenues
Affiliate fee $ 3,804 $ 3,541 $ 263 7 %

Amortization of cable distribution investments 38 53 (15 ) (28 ) %
Segment EBITDA $ 2,495 $ 2,308 $ 187 8 %

Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across all networks, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers across almost all networks. The decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in subscribers to traditional MVPDs, partially offset by an increase in digital MVPD subscribers. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher digital advertising revenue at FOX News and higher ratings for the daily studio programming at FS1, partially offset by the broadcast of two fewer 2018 MLB postseason games at FS1 and the absence of UFC in the second half of fiscal 2019.

42

Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased principally due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including the impact of higher amortization for college sports, NASCAR and the FIFA World Cup events and the addition of PBC at FS1, partially offset by the absence of UFC in the second half of fiscal 2019 and the UEFA Champions League. Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses were launch costs incurred in connection with the Company’s direct-to-consumer initiative at FOX News. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a standalone public company following the Distribution as compared to a full year of allocated costs in fiscal 2018.

Television (52% and 50% of the Company’s revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)

 For the years ended June 30,
----------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ - ---- - ------ ------ -------------- -------- - --- - -
 2019 2018 Change % Change
(in millions, except %) Better/(Worse)

Advertising $ 3,872 $ 3,478 $ 394 11 %

Selling, general and administrative (662 ) (614 ) (48 ) (8 ) %
Segment EBITDA $ 470 $ 379 $ 91 24 %

Revenues at the Television segment increased for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of FOX’s inaugural season of TNF and an additional NFL postseason game on the FOX Network and higher cyclical political advertising revenue due to the U.S. midterm elections at the FOX Television Stations. Also contributing to the increase in advertising revenue was higher pricing for entertainment programming at the FOX Network and the broadcast of the FIFA World Cup events, partially offset by two fewer broadcasts of the 2018 MLB World Series games and lower ratings for entertainment programming on the FOX Network. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network.

Television Segment EBITDA increased for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including the additional NFL games as well as higher amortization for the FIFA World Cup events, and the recognition of a write-down of approximately $55 million related to entertainment and syndicated programming rights (See Note 5—Inventories, net to the accompanying Financial Statements). Partially offsetting these increases in operating expenses were lower entertainment programming rights amortization and marketing costs as a result of fewer hours of original programming in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a standalone public company following the Distribution as compared to a full year of allocated costs in fiscal 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Beginning with the announcement of the Company’s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company has renamed as “Adjusted EBITDA” the measure that it had previously referred to as “Total Segment EBITDA” and, prior to the announcement of the Company’s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as “Total Segment OIBDA.” The definition of this measure has not changed: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax (expense) benefit.

Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company’s Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and

43

competitors’ data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences and the impact of COVID-19 and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures to contain their spread).

Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Current Financial Condition

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds which are highly dependent upon the continuation of affiliate agreements and the state of the advertising markets, the latter of which is being negatively impacted by the weak economic environment as a result of COVID-19. Depending on the duration and severity of the recession, it could lead to changes in consumer behavior, including increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to MVPD services, that adversely affect the Company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues. In addition, the Company’s business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes, particularly sports content. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, sports events to which the Company has broadcast rights have been cancelled or postponed and the production of certain entertainment content the Company distributes has been suspended. Depending on their duration and severity, these disruptions could materially adversely affect the Company’s future advertising revenues and, over a longer period of time, its future affiliate fee revenues. The magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors beyond the Company’s control. These include the duration and extent of the pandemic, including whether there is a “second-wave,” increases or spikes in the number of cases, or future mutations or related strains of the virus; the duration and extent of the recession, the pace of economic recovery and the economic and operating conditions facing the Company and others in the pandemic’s aftermath; the effect of governmental actions; and potential changes in consumer behavior. As part of actions the Company is taking to address COVID-19 and the resulting impact on its business, operations and employees, in April 2020, the Company implemented short-term cost reductions, including reducing executive compensation and suspending compensation increases. The Company has approximately $4.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements). The Company also has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions which could be impacted by COVID-19. As of June 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants.

The principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the Company’s programming along with investing approximately $150 million to $200 million in establishing standalone technical facilities over the two years following the Distribution; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.

In addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company’s securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness. See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash—Fiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2020 2019
----------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - -----
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,365 $ 2,524

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a payment to the USGA for contract termination costs related to the associated programming rights, higher cash paid for interest as a result of the senior notes issued in January 2019 and cash paid for income taxes as a result of operating as a standalone public company, partially offset by higher cash receipts at the Television segment.

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2020 2019
------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ---- -
Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,100 ) $ (637 )

The increase in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the acquisitions of Tubi, three television stations and Credible and the investment in Flutter, partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the Company’s investment in Roku during fiscal 2020 as compared to the investments in The Stars Group, Caffeine, Inc. (“Caffeine”) and Caffeine Studio, LLC (“Caffeine Studios”) during fiscal 2019 (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2020 2019
--------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - ------ -
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 146 $ (1,153 )

The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the April 2020 issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes, partially offset by repurchases of shares of the Company’s Common Stock and dividends paid to the Company’s stockholders during fiscal 2020 as compared to the Net transfers to Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. of $1.2 billion, the Dividend of $8.5 billion paid to 21CF net of the $2 billion cash payment received from Disney and the semi-annual cash dividend paid to the Company’s stockholders in June 2019, partially offset by the proceeds from the January 2019 issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019. The nature of activities included in Net transfers (to) from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. includes financing activities, capital transfers, cash sweeps, other treasury services and corporate expenses.

Stock Repurchase Program

See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Stock Repurchase Program.”

Dividends

Dividends paid in fiscal 2020 totaled $0.46 per share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.23 per share on both the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock. The dividend declared is payable on October 7, 2020 with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 2, 2020.

Based on the number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and the prospective annual dividend rate stated above, the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to stockholders in fiscal 2021 is approximately $280 million.

Sources and Uses of Cash—Fiscal 2019 vs. Fiscal 2018

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2019 2018
----------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - -----
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,524 $ 1,317

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to lower cash payments for entertainment programming and higher sports programming rights amortization over cash payments at the Television segment and higher operating results.

Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2019 2018
--------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ---
Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (637 ) $ 128

The change in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to the investments in The Stars Group, Caffeine and Caffeine Studios and the absence of cash received from the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) completed reverse auction for broadcast spectrum (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements).

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in millions):

For the years ended June 30, 2019 2018
--------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - -----
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (1,153 ) $ 1,036

The change in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was primarily due to Net transfers to Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2019, as compared to Net transfers from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the change in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was the Dividend of $8.5 billion paid to 21CF net of the $2 billion cash payment received from Disney and the semi-annual cash dividend paid to the Company’s stockholders in June 2019, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information). The nature of activities included in Net transfers (to) from Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. includes financing activities, capital transfers, cash sweeps, other treasury services and corporate expenses. Prior to December 31, 2017, the majority of the cash balances were swept to 21CF on a daily basis and the Company received capital from 21CF for the Company’s cash needs. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company ceased participating in 21CF’s capital and cash management accounts.

Pension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits

The table above excludes the Company’s pension, other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. The Company made contributions of $30 million and $83 million to its direct pension plans in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funded status of the plans. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. Required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the Company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. Payments due to participants under the Company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company’s OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company’s pension plans. The Company does not expect its net OPEB payments to be material in fiscal 2021 (See Note 15—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the accompanying Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans).

Contingencies

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. For the Company’s summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates

See Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Use of Estimates.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

Cable Network Programming and Television

The Company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the Company’s network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels, and from sales of broadcast advertising time on the Company’s owned and operated television stations and various digital properties. Advertising revenue from customers, primarily advertising agencies, is recognized as the commercials are aired. Certain of the Company’s advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views, referred to as impressions. Revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met, by providing additional advertisements. Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.

The Company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with traditional and digital MVPDs for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the Company’s owned and operated television stations. In addition, the Company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and receive retransmission consent fees from traditional and digital MVPDs for their signals. Affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming, a functional license of intellectual property, is made available to the customer which is done on a continuous basis. For contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate’s subscribers, revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period. For contracts with fixed affiliate fees, revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the contract term, which generally reflects the invoiced amount. Affiliate contracts are generally multi-year contracts with payments due monthly.

The Company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to MVPDs to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10-32-25 through 27, “Revenue Recognition—Consideration Payable to a Customer.” The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.

Programming

Costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 920, “Entertainment—Broadcasters.” Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Television broadcast network entertainment programming, which includes acquired series, co-produced series, movies and other programs, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.

49

As a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with the Company’s programming rights, the Company recognized write-downs of approximately $95 million and $55 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to sports, entertainment and syndicated programming rights at the Cable Network Programming and Television segments, which were recorded in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sports events. The costs of multi-year national sports contracts at the FOX Network and the Company’s sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period’s attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. Estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. The recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on the FOX Network and the Company’s sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company’s intangible assets include goodwill, FCC licenses, MVPD affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income.

The Company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles, including goodwill. Amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.

Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” The Company’s impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the Company to perform an interim impairment test.

The Company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing. The direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the U.S. broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.

During fiscal 2020, the Company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020 were not impaired. The Company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.

See Note 8—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Annual Impairment Review” for further discussion.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income tax in various domestic jurisdictions. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.”

The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.

For information regarding the impact of the Tax Act, see Note 16—Income Taxes to the accompanying Financial Statements.

Employee Costs

The measurement and recognition of costs of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions.

The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. Prior to the Separation and the Distribution, certain of the Company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by 21CF (“Shared Plans”), which include participants of other 21CF subsidiaries. Shared Plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans. Therefore, no asset or liability was recorded to recognize the funded status. In contemplation of the Separation and the Distribution, the pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities of the Shared Plans allocable to the Company’s employees were transferred to the Company in fiscal 2019 (See Note 15—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the accompanying Financial Statements).

For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension portfolio’s future return expectations of the various asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 50% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities and 25% in other investments.

The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the Company’s annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds.

The key assumptions used in developing the Company’s fiscal 2020 and 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:

 2020 2019
------------------------------- ----------------------- --- ---- - --- --- -
 (in millions, except %)
Discount rate for service cost 3.7 % 4.6 %
Discount rate for interest cost 3.2 % 4.1 %
Assets
Expected rate of return 7.0 % 7.0 %
Actual return $ 24 $ 50
Expected return 55 30
Actuarial (loss) gain $ (31 ) $ 20
One year actual return 3.4 % N/A

51

Discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date. The Company will utilize discount rates of 2.9% and 2.2% in calculating the fiscal 2021 service cost and interest cost, respectively, for its plans. The Company will use a long-term rate of return of 6.5% for fiscal 2021 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2020 were $533 million which increased from $385 million as of June 30, 2019. This increase of $148 million was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the Company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the Company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits.” Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.

The Company made contributions of $30 million, $83 million and $30 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.

Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:

Changes in Assumption Impact on Annual Pension Expense Impact on PBO
------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- --------------------
0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Increase $4 million Increase $45 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Decrease $4 million Decrease $42 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $2 million -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $2 million -

Fiscal 2021 net periodic pension expense for the Company’s pension plans is expected to increase to approximately $65 million primarily due to a decrease in discount rates.

Note 22. Deconsolidation of RBH: As discussed in Note 18. Contingencies, following the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Québec in two class action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. ("RBH"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019. This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense was included in marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment. RBH's share of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million. On March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. PMI has also determined that it does not exert "significant influence" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures). Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readi...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration.

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages.
