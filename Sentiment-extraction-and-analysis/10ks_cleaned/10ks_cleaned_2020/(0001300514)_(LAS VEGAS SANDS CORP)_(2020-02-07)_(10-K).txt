Cash Flows — Operating Activities
Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash generated from operating activities decreased $1.66 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $963 million land lease payment made in Singapore in connection with the MBS Expansion Project, an increase in interest cost as described above and a nonrecurring legal settlement. Additionally, working capital decreased versus the prior year due to lower levels of deposits from gaming customers and outstanding chips.
Cash Flows — Investing Activities
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled $1.22 billion, including $762 million in Macao, which consisted of $298 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, $282 million for Sands Cotai Central primarily for The Londoner Macao and $131 million for The Venetian Macao; $198 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; $195 million in Singapore; and $61 million for corporate and other activities.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled $949 million, including $535 million in Macao, which consisted primarily of $180 million for The Venetian Macao, $131 million for each of Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao; $182 million in Singapore; $127 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; and $105 million for corporate and other activities.
Cash Flows — Financing Activities
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily attributable to $3.0 billion in dividend payments, $754 million in common stock repurchases and $132 million in payments of financing costs, partially offset by proceeds of $495 million from the issuance of the 2025 LVSC Senior Note.
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily attributable to $2.98 billion in dividend payments and $905 million in common stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds of $2.42 billion from the issuance of the SCL Senior Notes and borrowings under the 2013 U.S. Credit Facility.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had $3.95 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore revolving facilities, net of letters of credit. Additionally, we had $2.78 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility to finance construction costs incurred in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.
Capital Financing Overview
We fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments (see "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 8 — Long-Term Debt") and operating cash flows.
In July 2019, LVSC issued, in a public offering, three series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $3.50 billion. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the 2013 U.S. Credit Facility. In November 2019, LVSC issued, in a public offering, an additional series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. (see "Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 8 — Long-Term Debt — Corporate and U.S. Related Debt — LVSC Senior Notes").
Our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt or net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined ("Adjusted EBITDA"). As of December 31, 2019, our U.S., Macao and Singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 1.2x, 1.8x and 2.0x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 4.0x, 4.0x and 4.5x, respectively. If we

57

are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities.
Any defaults under our debt agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. If the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance we would be able to repay or refinance any amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.23 billion and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16 million as of December 31, 2019, of which approximately $2.89 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $2.89 billion, approximately $2.15 billion is available to be repatriated to the U.S., and we do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. The remaining unrestricted amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL. We believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $3.95 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and $2.78 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility, as of December 31, 2019, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and recorded $2.37 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. In January 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per common share (a total estimated to be approximately $603 million) to be paid on March 26, 2020, to shareholders of record on March 18, 2020. We expect this level of dividend to continue quarterly through the remainder of 2020. Our Board of Directors will continually assess the level and appropriateness of any cash dividends.
On February 22 and June 21, 2019, SCL paid a dividend of 0.99 Hong Kong dollars ("HKD") and HKD 1.00 per share, respectively, to SCL shareholders (a total of $2.05 billion, of which we retained $1.44 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019). In January 2020, the Board of Directors of SCL declared a dividend of HKD 0.99 per share (a total of $1.03 billion, of which we will retain approximately $720 million) to SCL shareholders of record on February 5, 2020, which will be paid on February 21, 2020.
In November 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $1.56 billion of our outstanding common stock, which was to expire in November 2018. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the remaining repurchase amount of $1.11 billion to $2.50 billion and extending the expiration date to November 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 12,556,635 shares of our common stock for $754 million (including commissions) under this program. All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

(1) As of December 31, 2019, we had an $81 million liability related to uncertain tax positions; we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the

61

Table of Contents

reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts
We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at our operating casino resorts in Macao, Singapore and the U.S., which we regularly evaluate. We specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information, and we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under the specified dollar amount. We also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves. Credit or marker play was 14.7%, 23.9% and 66.8% of table games play at our Macao properties, Marina Bay Sands and Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our allowance for doubtful casino accounts was 32.3% and 41.1% of gross casino receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The credit extended to gaming promoters can be offset by the commissions payable to said gaming promoters, which is considered in the establishment of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
Litigation Accrual
We are subject to various claims and legal actions. We estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Property and Equipment
At December 31, 2019, we had net property and equipment of $14.84 billion, representing 64.0% of our total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations, such as contractual life. Future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. The estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis.
For assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). Secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. We estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
To estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. Determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. Future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.

Table of Contents

For assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. Any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. Fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Our foreign and U.S. tax rate differential reflects the fact that U.S. tax rates are higher than the statutory tax rates in Singapore and Macao of 17% and 12%, respectively. In August 2018, we received an additional exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expires. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for an annual payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2019) that is a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits. We intend to request extensions of these tax arrangements; however, there is no assurance we will receive the additional agreement.
Accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring and tax planning strategies.
We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $279 million and $268 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations of $4.51 billion and $4.50 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. To the extent the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made, as appropriate.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. We recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $134 million and $118 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Macao, and Singapore. We could be subject to examination for tax years beginning 2010 in the U.S. and tax years beginning in 2015 in Macao and Singapore.
U.S. tax reform made significant changes to U.S. income tax laws including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% effective beginning in 2018 and transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system resulting in dividends from our foreign subsidiaries not being subject to U.S. income tax and therefore, no longer generating U.S. foreign tax credits. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $526 million

relating to the reduction of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that were previously determined not likely to be utilized and also the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate of 21%. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $57 million resulting from guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service related to certain international provisions of U.S. tax reform.

Cash Flows — Operating Activities
Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash generated from operating activities decreased $1.66 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $963 million land lease payment made in Singapore in connection with the MBS Expansion Project, an increase in interest cost as described above and a nonrecurring legal settlement. Additionally, working capital decreased versus the prior year due to lower levels of deposits from gaming customers and outstanding chips.
Cash Flows — Investing Activities
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled $1.22 billion, including $762 million in Macao, which consisted of $298 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, $282 million for Sands Cotai Central primarily for The Londoner Macao and $131 million for The Venetian Macao; $198 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; $195 million in Singapore; and $61 million for corporate and other activities.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled $949 million, including $535 million in Macao, which consisted primarily of $180 million for The Venetian Macao, $131 million for each of Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao; $182 million in Singapore; $127 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; and $105 million for corporate and other activities.

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...
