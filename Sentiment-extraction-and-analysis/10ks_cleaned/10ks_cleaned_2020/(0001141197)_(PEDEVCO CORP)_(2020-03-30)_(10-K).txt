ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains
“forward-looking
statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates,
beliefs and expected performance. We caution you that assumptions,
expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the
differences can be material. See “Risk Factors” and
“Forward Looking
Statements.”

Overview

We are an oil and gas company focused on the
development, acquisition and production of oil and natural
gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and
completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. In
particular, we focus on legacy proven properties where there is a
long production history, well defined geology and existing
infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field
management technologies. Our current properties are located in the
San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas
and eastern New Mexico and in the
Denver-Julesberg Basin in Colorado.  As of December 31, 2019,
we held approximately 38,258 net Permian Basin acres located in
Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, through PEDCO and
approximately 11,948 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan
Counties, Colorado, through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary,
Red Hawk. As of December 31, 2019, we held interests in 379
gross (302 net) wells in our Permian Basin Asset of which 51
are active producers, 25 are active injectors and one well is an
active Saltwater Disposal Well (“SWD”), all of which are held by PEDCO and
operated by its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, and interests
in 75 gross (21.9 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which
18 gross (16.2 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and
currently producing, 36 gross (5.6 net) wells are
non-operated, and 21 wells have an after-payout
interest.

Detailed
information about our business plans and operations, including our
core D-J Basin and Permian Basin Assets, is contained under
“Part
I” — “Item 1. Business”
above.

How We Conduct Our Business and Evaluate Our
Operations

Our use
of capital for acquisitions and development allows us to direct our
capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive
opportunities as market conditions evolve. We have historically
acquired properties that we believe had significant appreciation
potential. We intend to continue to acquire both operated and
non-operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our
return objectives.

We will
use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the
performance of our oil and natural gas operations,
including:

●

production
volumes;

●

realized
prices on the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effects of
our commodity derivative contracts;

●

oil
and natural gas production and operating expenses;

●

capital
expenditures;

●

general
and administrative expenses;

●

net
cash provided by operating activities; and

●

net
income.

Reserves

Our
estimated net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at December
31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 14.0 million Boe and 12.4
million Boe, respectively. This reserve level increased
approximately 1.6 million Boe or13%, from 2018 to 2019. In 2019, we
had an increase in reserves primarily due to the drilling and
completion of nine new productive wells in the Permian Basin, as
well as our participation (non-operated working interest), in 11
productive wells in the DJ-Basin.

60

Using the average monthly crude oil price of
$55.69 per Bbl and natural gas price of $2.58 per thousand cubic
feet (Mcf) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our
estimated discounted future net cash flow (PV-10) before tax
expenses for our proved reserves was approximately $122.7 million,
of which approximately $82.8 million are proved undeveloped
reserves. Total reserve value at December 31, 2019 represents a
decrease of approximately $58.6 million or 32% from a year earlier
using the same SEC pricing and reserves methodology. The decrease
can be attributed to a $69.1 million reduction due to changes in
commodity prices, coupled with a $21.5 million reduction due to
increases in capital costs for proved undeveloped reserves and
operating expenses, offset by a $32.0 million increase in proved
developed reserves from our drilling and completion activity during
the period which is noted above.

The
reserves as of December 31, 2019 were determined in accordance with
standard industry practices and SEC regulations by the licensed
independent petroleum engineering firm of Cawley, Gillespie &
Associates, Inc. A large portion of the proved undeveloped crude
oil reserves are associated with the Permian Basin formation.
Although these hydrocarbon quantities have been determined in
accordance with industry standards, they are prepared using the
subjective judgments of the independent engineers and may actually
be more or less.

Oil and Natural Gas Sales Volumes

During
the year ended December 31, 2019, our net crude oil, natural gas
and NGLs sales volumes increased to 266,070 Bbls or 729 Bopd from
92,985 Bbls, or 255 Bopd, a 186% increase over the previous fiscal
year. The production increase is primarily related to the
Company’ acquisition of oil and gas properties in third
quarter of 2018, which in turn increased production for 2019, and
the drilling and completion of five new productive wells, four of
which began production in the first quarter of 2019, in the Permian
Basin, as well as our participation (non-operated working
interest) in 11 productive wells in the DJ-Basin.

Significant Capital Expenditures

The
table below sets out the significant components of capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in
thousands):

 2019
--------------------------- -------
Capital Expenditures
Leasehold Acquisitions (1) $468
Property Acquisitions (1) 652
Drilling and Facilities (2) 41,810

(1)

Consists of amounts
related to the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties during
2019 (discussed in greater detail at “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” - “Note 6 - Oil and
Gas Properties.”)

(2)

Consists of
amounts primarily related to the drilling and completion of nine
wells in the Permian and our participation in the drilling and
completion of 11 wells in the DJ-Basin by a third-party
operator.

Market Conditions and Commodity Prices

Our
financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of
natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production
on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by
many factors outside of our control, including changes in market
supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions,
inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As
a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and,
therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what
effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our
production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes
and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of
natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical
to our long-term success. We expect prices to remain volatile for
the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of
realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and
condensate revenues, refer to “Results of Operations”
below.

Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for
each of the two fiscal years in the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements of PEDEVCO Corp. and notes thereto included
herein (see “Part
II” – “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data”).

61

We reported a net loss for the year ended December
31, 2019 of $11.1 million, or ($0.22) per share, compared to
net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $53.6 million or
$4.80 per share. The decrease in net income of $64.7 million was
primarily due to the recognition of a one-time $70.3 million gain
on debt restructuring in June 2018. Excluding this significant
non-recurring transaction, our net loss decreased by $5.6 million,
due to a reduction in interest expense incurred of $6.9 million, as
a result of our 2018 debt restructuring, coupled with $8.4
million in additional revenue and a $1.0 million gain on asset
sale, offset by a $0.5 million loss on the settlement of Asset
Retirement Obligations (“ARO”) and additional
operating expenses of $10.2 million, from the Company’s
production increases, as well as the hiring of additional staff and
consultants, when comparing the
current period to the prior period.

Net Revenues

The
following table sets forth the revenue and
production data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018:

 %
-------------------------------------- ------- ------ ------------------- -------------------
 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease)

Total (Boe per day) 729 255 474 186%

Average Sale Price:
Crude Oil ($/Bbl) $53.41 $59.00 $(5.59) (9%)
Natural Gas($/Mcf) 2.43 2.56 (0.13) (5%)
NGL ($/Bbl) 13.28 18.32 (5.04) (28%)

Net Operating Revenues (In thousands):
Crude Oil $12,518 $4,153 $8,365 201%
Natural Gas 372 230 142 62%
NGL 82 140 (58) (41%)
Total Revenues $12,972 $4,523 $8,449 187%

(1) Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas equivalents to 1 barrel of oil.

Total crude oil and natural gas revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 187%, to
$13.0 million, compared to $4.5 million for the same period a year
ago due primarily to a favorable crude oil volume variance of
$8.9 million, offset by an unfavorable crude oil price
variance of $0.4 million. Production
increases are primarily from our drilling and completing five
productive wells in our Permian Basin, as well as our
participation (non-operated working interest) in the drilling
and completion of 11 productive wells in our DJ-Basin and
additional workover activities during the period.

Gain on Debt Extinguishment $- $70,309 $(70,309) (100%)
Other Expense $106 $- $106 100%

*Includes severance, ad valorem taxes and marketing
costs.

Lease Operating
Expenses. The increase of $4.0 million in lease operating
expenses was primarily due to $0.7 million in increased workover
expenses coupled with higher direct and variable lease operating
expenses associated with the higher oil volume resulting from the
increased number of wells and increased oil production during the
current year’s period, compared to the prior year’s
period, due to the Permian Basin Asset acquisition in September
2018, as well as production from our completed wells in
2019.

Exploration
Expense.  There was a
minimal change in exploration expenses for 2019 compared to 2018,
as there was a minimal increase in exploration activity undertaken
by the Company in the current year’s period compared to the
prior year’s period.

Depreciation, Depletion,
Amortization and Accretion. The $4.5 million increase in
depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was primarily
the result of higher oil volume resulting from the increased number
of wells and increased oil production from our four new producing
wells during the current year’s period, compared to the prior
year’s period.

Loss on Settlement of ARO. During 2019, the Company incurred a $0.5 million
loss on the plugging and abandonment of seven wells located in our
Permian Asset. The Company experienced unforeseen fishing and
cleanout costs, in addition to a lack of available service
providers, which resulted in additional premium
charges.

General and Administrative
Expenses (excluding share-based compensation). The increase
of $1.0 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding
share-based compensation) was primarily due to increases in
payroll, as well as other cost increases, resulting from the hiring
of additional personnel and consultants during the current
year’s period, compared to the prior year’s
period.

63

Share-Based
Compensation. Share-based
compensation, which is included in general and administrative
expenses in the Statements of Operations, increased by $0.7 million
primarily due to an increase in the awarding of employee
stock-based options and compensation. Share-based compensation is
utilized for the purpose of conserving cash resources for
use in field development activities and operations.

Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas
Properties.  The
Company sold rights to 85.5 net acres and acquired 121 net acres of
oil and gas leases located in Weld County, Colorado, to a third
party during 2019, for aggregate proceeds of $1.2 million and
recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of $1.0
million.

Interest Expense.  The decrease of $6.9 million in
interest expense was due primarily to the conversion of all of our
outstanding debt in the first quarter of 2019, coupled with the
Company’s June 2018 debt restructuring, noted above, when
comparing the current period to the prior period.

Gain on Debt Extinguishment.
During 2018, the Company recognized a
one-time gain of $70.3 million on the Company’s debt
restructuring, which occurred in June 2018.

Interest Income and Other Expense.
Includes interest earned from our interest-bearing cash accounts,
and the write-off of a $0.1 million third party option related to
the option to acquire shares of Caspian Energy, described in
greater detail under “Part II” - “Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - “Note 7
– Other Current Assets” which expired unexercised as of
May 12, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The
primary sources of cash for the Company during the year ended
December 31, 2019 were funds borrowed pursuant to convertible
promissory notes (which were subsequently converted into common
stock) and the sale of restricted common stock, which funds
primarily came from SK Energy, which is owned and controlled by Dr.
Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of
Directors, and Mr. Viktor Tkachev, an unrelated investor who
purchased $12.0 million of restricted common stock, and sales of
crude oil and natural gas. The primary uses of cash were funds used
for development costs and operations.

Working Capital

At
December 31, 2019, the Company’s total current assets of
$27.1 million exceeded its total current liabilities of $15.2
million, resulting in a working capital surplus of $11.9 million,
which included a reclassification of $3.3 million of restricted
cash from current to other assets, as it was determined that the
restricted cash, which is used as collateral for surety bonds in
our New Mexico operations, would be long-term in nature. See
“Part
II” - “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” - “Note 4 – Cash”). At
December 31, 2018, the Company’s total current liabilities of
$8.9 million exceeded its total current assets of $6.8 million,
resulting in a working capital deficit of $2.1 million. The $14.0
million increase in our working capital surplus is primarily
related to cash borrowed under convertible notes (subsequently
converted into common stock) and the sale of common stock
during the period, which amounts were in excess of amounts used to
fund payables and accrued expenses related to our capital drilling
projects.

Financing

A
summary of our financing transactions and other recent funding
transactions can be found above under “Part I” –
“Item 1. Business” – “Current Year
Events”; and “Part II” - “Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - “Note 8
– Notes Payable”, “Note 11 –
Stockholders’ Equity – Common Stock” and
“Note 14 – Related Party Transactions”, which
information is incorporated by reference herein.

Cash Flows (in thousands)

 Year Ended December 31,
----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------
 2019 2018
Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities $1,669 $(1,494)
Cash flows used in investing activities (39,736) (23,118)
Cash flows provided by financing activities 58,000 29,474
Net increase in cash and restricted cash $19,933 $4,862

64

Cash Flows provided by (used in) Operating
Activities. Net cash provided by operating
activities increased by $3.2 million for the current year, when
compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in our net
loss of $6.4 million, when not factoring in our $70.3 million gain
on debt restructuring which occurred in the prior period, coupled
with a $4.0 million decrease in capitalized and deferred interest
expense, a $1.0 million gain on asset sales and net increases to
our other components of working capital, which are related to our
increased revenue and production levels from our drilling and
completion activity in the current year.

Cash Flows used in Investing
Activities. Net cash used in investing activities
increased by $16.6 million for the current year, when compared to
the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $39.6 million in
drilling and completion activities in the current year, offset by a
$1.2 million property sale in the current period and $21.8 million
in additional acquisition and equipment costs in the prior year
compared to the current year.

Cash Flows provided by Financing
Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities
increased by $28.5 million primarily due to $43.0 million in
proceeds from the sale of common stock in the current year, offset
by a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of notes payable from
the prior year compared to the current year of $22.9 million. There
was also $7.8 million of repayment of notes payable and a $1.1
million warrant repurchase, offset by $0.4 million in proceeds from
the issuance of a note payable in the prior year, which contributed
to the increase in the current year, when compared to the prior
year.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The
Company does not participate in financial transactions that
generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in
preparation of our financial statements.

Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts
Method. The successful efforts method of accounting is
used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under
this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and
facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties
are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when
incurred. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration
and evaluation assets pending determination of whether the wells
find proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are
the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and
costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include
consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions.

Exploratory wells
in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for
economic viability within one year of completion of drilling. The
related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is determined
that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise, the
related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties and
subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are found
to have economically viable reserves in areas where major capital
expenditure will be required before production can commence, the
related well costs remain capitalized only if additional drilling
is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise the related well costs
are expensed as dry holes.

Exploration and
evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition of
an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for in
accordance with the policy outlined above.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is
calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production
method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total
estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other
capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
Costs specific to developmental wells
for which drilling is in progress or uncompleted are
capitalized as wells in progress and not subject to amortization
until completion and production commences, at which time
amortization on the basis of production will begin.

65

Revenue Recognition.  ASU 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606)”, supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements and industry-specific guidance under
Revenue Recognition (Topic
605). Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue when
it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled
to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted
Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective
method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January
1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method, prior period
financial positions and results will not be adjusted. The
cumulative effect adjustment recognized in the opening balances
included no significant changes as a result of this adoption. Topic
606 requires certain changes to the presentation of revenues and
related expenses beginning January 1, 2018. Refer to “Note 5
– Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for additional
information.

The
Company’s revenue is comprised entirely of revenue from
exploration and production activities. The Company’s oil is
sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas
is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas
pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution
companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to
direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally
received from the customer in the month following
delivery.

Contracts with
customers have varying terms, including month-to-month contracts,
and contracts with a finite term. The Company recognizes sales
revenues for oil, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each
product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer.
Generally, control transfers at the time of delivery to the
customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing
facility, or as a tanker lifting is completed. Revenue is measured
based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and
may include adjustments for market differentials and downstream
costs incurred by the customer, including gathering,
transportation, and fuel costs.

Revenues are
recognized for the sale of the Company’s net share of
production volumes. Sales on behalf of other working interest
owners and royalty interest owners are not recognized as
revenues.

Stock-Based Compensation. Pursuant
to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation, which establishes
accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service,
we utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock option awards at the date of grant,
which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these
inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of
estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These
assumptions are subjective and generally require significant
analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some
of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external
data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical
experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate
weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment,
based on relevant facts and circumstances. We estimate volatility
by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use
the simplified method for estimating expected term, which is equal
to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual
term.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...
