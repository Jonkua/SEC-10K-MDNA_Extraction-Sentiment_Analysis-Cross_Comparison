NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The discussions in “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK” and “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” below include references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments) and refining, ethanol, and renewable diesel segment margin. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years. See the tables in note (f) beginning on page 39 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (f), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Overview
For 2019, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $2.4 billion compared to $3.1 billion for 2018, which represents a decrease of $700 million. This decrease is the result of a $569 million decrease in net income and a $131 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to a $279 million pre-tax increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (a) on page 38. The decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease of $736 million in operating income between the periods, net of the resulting $177 million decrease in income tax expense.

While operating income decreased by $736 million in 2019 compared to 2018, adjusted operating income decreased by $1.0 billion. Adjusted operating income excludes adjustments reflected in the table in note (f) on page 42.

The $1.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment. Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to weaker discounts on crude oils and other feedstocks and lower throughput volumes, partially offset by improved distillate margins. This is more fully described on pages 31 and 32.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment. Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $78 million primarily due to higher corn prices and higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by higher ethanol prices. This is more fully described on page 33.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment. Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $259 million primarily due to an increase in renewable diesel sales volumes and an increase in the benefit from the blender’s tax credit resulting from an increase in the volume of renewable diesel blended with petroleum-based diesel in 2019 compared to 2018. This is more fully described on pages 34 and 35.

Outlook
Below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2020:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Distillate margins are expected to begin improving due to an anticipated increase in global demand as trade war tensions ease and markets comply with the International Maritime Organization’s lower bunker fuel sulfur specifications, which were effective January 1, 2020. Gasoline margins are expected to remain near current levels.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discounts for medium and heavy sour crude oils are expected to remain near current levels as compliance with the new bunker fuel sulfur specifications noted above is expected to reduce demand for high sulfur fuel oils, which compete with sour crude oils as a refining feedstock.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol margins are expected to decline as domestic inventory levels rise.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment margins are expected to remain near current levels.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our refining operations in the U.K. could be adversely affected by Brexit, which formally occurred on January 31, 2020. Although the legal relationship between the U.K. and the EU has changed, their ongoing relationship will continue to follow the EU’s rules during a transition period that is set to expire on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. and the EU are expected to negotiate a new free trade agreement, which could negatively impact the operations of our Pembroke Refinery and our marketing operations in the U.K. and Ireland, as could the failure to reach any agreement. The ultimate effect of Brexit will depend on whether an agreement is reached, or on the specific terms of any agreement that is reached by the U.K. and the EU. See Item 1A “RISK FACTORS”—Changes in the U.K.’s economic and other relationships with the EU could adversely affect us.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Global concern about the coronavirus outbreak could result in lower demand for and consumption of transportation fuels, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in note (f) beginning on page 39, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations.

Effective January 1, 2019, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production. The renewable diesel segment includes the operations of DGD, which were transferred from the refining segment on January 1, 2019. Also effective January 1, 2019, we no longer have a VLP segment, and we include the operations of VLP in our refining segment. This change was made because of the Merger Transaction with VLP, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the resulting change in how we manage VLP’s operations. We no longer manage VLP as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.

Revenues decreased by $8.7 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment. This decline in revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $7.9 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and a decrease of $57 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in a decrease in operating income of $736 million in 2019 compared to 2018.

General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $57 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million associated with certain non-operating sites in 2018, partially offset by increases in legal and other environmental reserves of $24 million and $12 million, respectively, as well as higher taxes other than income taxes of $8 million and expenses associated with the Merger Transaction with VLP of $7 million.

Adjusted operating income was $3.7 billion in 2019 compared to $4.7 billion in 2018. Details regarding the $1.0 billion decrease in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.

“Other income, net” decreased by $26 million in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest income of $30 million and higher foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, partially offset by the favorable effect of a $16 million lower charge for the early redemption of debt between the periods. As described in note (d) on page 39, we redeemed debt in both 2019 and 2018 and incurred early redemption charges of $22 million and $38 million, respectively.

Income tax expense decreased by $177 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 20 percent for 2019 compared to 21 percent for 2018.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $131 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $279 million increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest, as described in note (a) on page 38.

Refining segment revenues decreased by $9.3 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices. This decline in refining segment revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of $8.2 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in a decrease in refining segment operating income of $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018.

Table of Contents

Refining segment adjusted operating income also decreased by $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment margin is primarily affected by refined petroleum product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. The market prices for refined petroleum products generally track the price of benchmark crude oils, such as Brent, WTI, and ANS. An increase in the differential between the market price of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of the reference benchmark crude oil has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin, while a decline in this differential has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. Additionally, our refining segment margin is affected by our ability to purchase and process crude oils and other feedstocks that are priced at a discount to Brent and other benchmark crude oils. While we benefit when we process these types of crude oils and other feedstocks, that benefit will vary as the discount widens or narrows. Improvement in these discounts has a favorable impact on our refining segment margin as it lowers our cost of materials; whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 29 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018. Refining segment margin decreased by $853 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Lower discounts on crude oils had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $628 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Lower discounts on feedstocks other than crude oils, such as natural gas and residuals, had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $360 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A decrease in throughput volumes of 34,000 BPD had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $128 million.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A decrease in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had a favorable impact on our refining segment margin of $218 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in distillate margins throughout most of our regions had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $202 million.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $135 million primarily due to higher maintenance costs of $86 million, along with the effect of favorable property tax settlements of $20 million and sales and use tax refunds of $17 million received in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $152 million primarily due to higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $82 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $79 million associated with capital projects that were completed and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2018 and early 2019, partially offset by the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.

Ethanol segment revenues increased by $199 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in ethanol prices. This improvement in ethanol segment revenue was outweighed by higher cost of sales of $277 million, resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment operating income of $79 million in 2019 compared to 2018.

Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $78 million. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by ethanol and corn related co-product prices and the cost of corn. The table on page 30 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018. Ethanol segment margin decreased by $32 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher corn prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $166 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher ethanol prices had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $123 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $34 million primarily due to costs to operate the three plants acquired from Green Plains, Inc. (Green Plains) in November 2018 of $79 million, partially offset by lower energy costs of $29 million and lower chemicals and catalyst costs of $12 million incurred by our other ethanol plants.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $12 million primarily due to depreciation expense associated with the three plants acquired from Green Plains in November 2018.

Renewable diesel segment revenues increased by $539 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in renewable diesel sales volumes. This improvement in renewable diesel segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $128 million, resulting in an increase in renewable diesel segment operating income of $411 million.

Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $259 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment margin increased by $289 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in sales volumes of 329,000 gallons per day, which is primarily due to the additional production capacity resulting from the expansion of the DGD Plant completed in the third quarter of 2018, had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $162 million.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in the benefit for the blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during 2019 compared to 2018 had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $119 million. As more fully described in note (a) on page 38, blender’s tax credits of $275 million and $156 million were attributable to volumes blended during 2019 and 2018, respectively.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $9 million, which is primarily attributable to increased costs resulting from the expansion of the DGD Plant completed in the third quarter of 2018.

Table of Contents

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $21 million primarily due to higher turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $13 million and depreciation expense associated with the expansion of the DGD Plant completed in the third quarter of 2018 of $5 million.

(a) Cost of materials and other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes a benefit of $449 million and $170 million, respectively, for the blender’s tax credit. The benefit recognized in 2019 is attributable to volumes blended during 2019 and 2018 and was recognized in December 2019 because the U.S legislation authorizing the credit was passed and signed into law in that month. The benefit recognized in 2018 is attributable to volumes blended during 2017 and was recognized in February 2018 because the U.S. legislation authorizing the credit was passed and signed into law in that month.

The $449 million and $170 million pre-tax benefits are attributable to volumes blended during the three years and are reflected in our reportable segments as follows (in millions):

(f) We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.

We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 231 91 140

Revenues increased by $23.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment. This improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $22.0 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, and an increase of $96 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), resulting in an increase in operating income of $1.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.

General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $96 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of $108 million associated with certain non-operating sites in 2018, partially offset by expenses incurred in 2017 associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. of $16 million.

Adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion in 2018 compared to $3.8 billion in 2017. Details regarding the $919 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below.

“Other income, net” increased by $18 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher equity in earnings associated with our Diamond pipeline joint venture of $39 million and higher interest income of $29 million, partially offset by a $38 million charge for the early redemption of debt as described in note (d) on page 39.

Income tax expense increased by $1.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the effect from a $1.9 billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from Tax Reform, as described in note (e) on page 39. Excluding the effect of Tax Reform from 2017, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28 percent compared to 21 percent for 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 as a result of Tax Reform.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $140 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher earnings associated with DGD, which includes a benefit for the blender’s tax credit

Refining segment revenues increased by $22.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices. This improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $21.9 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs, resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of $936 million in 2018 compared to 2017.

Refining segment adjusted operating income increased by $902 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.

 whereas lower discounts result in higher cost of materials, which has a negative impact on our refining segment margin. The table on page 37 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017. Refining segment margin increased by $1.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in distillate margins throughout all of our regions had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.

Table of Contents

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher discounts on crude oils had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $561 million.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A decrease in the cost of biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of $406 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in throughput volumes of 46,000 BPD had a favorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $153 million.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A decrease in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately $1.3 billion.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $140 million primarily due to higher employee-related expenses of $33 million, an increase in energy costs of $28 million, the effect of a favorable insurance settlement of $20 million in 2017 for our McKee Refinery, higher maintenance expense of $17 million, and higher chemicals and catalyst costs of $15 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by $86 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of $44 million associated with capital projects that were completed in the latter part of 2017 and early 2018 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of $35 million, along with the write-off of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of $15 million.

Ethanol Segment Results
The following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2018 and 2017. The selected financial data is derived from the Financial Highlights by Segment and Total Company tables on pages 35 and 36, respectively, unless otherwise noted.

compared to 2017. The components of this decrease, along with the reasons for the changes in these components, are outlined below.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by ethanol and corn related co-product prices and the cost of corn. The table on page 38 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017. Ethanol segment margin decreased by $66 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $159 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher corn prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $36 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher prices of the corn related co-products that we produced had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $101 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Higher production volumes of 137,000 gallons per day had a favorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $26 million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $27 million primarily due to costs to operate the three plants acquired from Green Plains in November 2018 of $14 million and higher chemicals and catalysts costs of $8 million incurred by our other ethanol plants.

Renewable Diesel Segment Results

a decrease in total cost of sales of $217 million, resulted in an increase in renewable diesel segment operating income of $261 million.

Renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by $97 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The components of this increase, along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment margin increased by $116 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An increase in renewable diesel prices in 2018 had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $60 million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ Price risk management activities had a favorable impact to our renewable diesel segment margin of $40 million. We recognized a hedge gain of $29 million in 2018 from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities compared to a loss of $11 million in 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Renewable diesel segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) increased by $19 million primarily attributable to higher chemical and catalyst costs of $10 million and increased costs resulting from the expansion of the DGD Plant completed in the third quarter of 2018 of $3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview
We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments.

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (399 ) $ (2,868 ) $ 1,034

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our operations generated $5.5 billion of cash in 2019, driven primarily by net income of $2.8 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.5 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $294 million. Noncash charges included $2.3 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $234 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $294 million change in working capital was mainly due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $1.5 billion in accounts payable due to an increase in commodity prices in December 2019 compared to December 2018 combined with an increase in crude oil volumes purchased and the timing of payments of invoices;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $427 million in prepaid expenses and other mainly due to a decrease in income taxes receivable resulting from a refund of $348 million, including interest, associated with the settlement of the combined audit related to our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $385 million in inventories due to an increase in commodity prices in December 2019 compared to December 2018 combined with higher inventory levels.

The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) $992 million of proceeds from debt issuances related to our 4.00 percent Senior Notes, (ii) $239 million of proceeds from borrowings of VIEs, and (iii) $399 million from available cash on hand, were used mainly to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• fund $2.7 billion in capital investments, as defined in “Capital Investments” on page 50, of which $160 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• fund $225 million of capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• acquire undivided interests in pipeline and terminal assets for $72 million;

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Our operations generated $4.4 billion of cash in 2018, driven primarily by net income of $3.4 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.3 billion, partially offset by a negative change in working capital of $1.3 billion. Noncash charges included $2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $203 million of deferred income tax expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is detailed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $457 million in receivables resulting from an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in commodity prices;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $197 million in inventory primarily due to higher inventory levels;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $684 million in income taxes payable primarily resulting from (i) $527 million of payments in early 2018 related to 2017 tax liabilities and (ii) $181 million of payments in late 2018 that will be applied to 2019 tax liabilities;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $113 million in accrued expenses mainly due to the timing of payments on our environmental compliance program obligations; partially offset by

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table of Contents

capital of $1.3 billion were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017. Other noncash charges included $2.0 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The Tax Reform benefit and the change in our working capital are detailed in Notes 15 and 18, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The source of cash resulting from the $1.3 billion change in working capital was mainly due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $1.8 billion in accounts payable primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $489 million in income taxes payable resulting from deferring the payment of our fourth quarter 2017 estimated taxes to January 2018, as allowed by tax relief authorization from the IRS; partially offset by

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $870 million in receivables primarily as a result of an increase in commodity prices; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $516 million in inventory due to higher volumes held combined with an increase in commodity prices.

The $5.5 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with borrowings of $380 million under the VLP Revolver, were used mainly to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• fund $2.3 billion in capital investments, of which $88 million related to self-funded capital investments by DGD;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• fund $26 million of capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

• pay distributions to noncontrolling interests of $67 million; and

- ------------------------------------------------
• increase available cash on hand by $1.0 billion.

Capital Investments
Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are improved continuously. The cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, can be significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.

We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.

50

Table of Contents

We consider capital investments to include the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Capital expenditures for purchases of, additions to, and improvements in our property, plant, and equipment, including those made by DGD but excluding other VIEs;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, including those made by DGD; and

- ---------------------------------------------
• Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

We include DGD’s capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures in capital investments because we, as operator of DGD, manage its capital projects and expenditures. We do not include the capital expenditures of our other consolidated VIEs in capital investments because we do not operate those VIEs. In addition, we do not include expenditures for acquisitions and acquisitions of undivided interests in capital investments.

We expect to make capital investments of approximately $2.5 billion in 2020. Approximately 60 percent of those investments are for sustaining the business and 40 percent are for growth strategies. However, we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions, including acquisitions of undivided interests.

Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources
Stock Purchase Program
On January 23, 2018, our board of directors authorized the 2018 Program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion remaining available for purchase under the 2018 Program with no expiration date. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program.

Pension Plan Funding
We plan to contribute approximately $140 million to our pension plans and $21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2020. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities.

Tax Matters
We take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.

As of December 31, 2019, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, was $868 million. Of this amount, $525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid

51

Table of Contents

on incentive payments received from the U.S. federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products. We recorded a tax refund receivable of $525 million in connection with our refund claims, but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims. Therefore, our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims. The remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, of $343 million represents our potential future obligations to various taxing authorities if the tax positions associated with that liability are not sustained.

Details about our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Held by Our International Subsidiaries
As of December 31, 2019, $1.5 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our international subsidiaries. Cash held by our international subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any U.S. federal income tax consequences as a result of the deemed repatriation provisions of Tax Reform, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our international subsidiaries to us, but we believe that such amount is not material to our financial position or liquidity.

Concentration of Customers
Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

(a) Debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Finance lease obligations include related interest expense. Debt obligations due in 2020 include $348 million associated with borrowings under the IEnova Revolver (as defined and described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for the construction of terminals in Mexico by Central Mexico Terminals (as defined and described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The IEnova Revolver is only available to the operations of Central Mexico Terminals, and its creditors do not have recourse against us.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------
(b) Operating lease liabilities include related interest expense.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Other long-term liabilities exclude amounts related to the long-term portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above.

Debt and Finance Lease Obligations
Our debt and finance lease obligations are described in Notes 9 and 5, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase. As of December 31, 2019, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt, including debt guaranteed by us, are at or above investment grade level as follows:

---------------------------------- ---------------------

Rating Agency Rating
Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)
Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)

We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.

Debt Obligations – Interest Payments
Interest payments for our debt obligations as described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are the expected payments based on information available as of December 31, 2019.

53

Table of Contents

Operating Lease Liabilities
Our operating lease liabilities arise from leasing arrangements for the right to use various classes of underlying assets as described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities are recognized for leasing arrangements with terms greater than one year and are not reduced by minimum lease payments to be received by us under subleases.

Purchase Obligations
A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, industrial gas supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), natural gas supply arrangements, and various throughput, transportation and terminaling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.

Other Long-Term Liabilities
Our other long-term liabilities are described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the preceding table, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2019.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective January 1, 2020, or will become effective in the future. The effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the above-referenced note.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
We take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax

benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.

The evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. These judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.

Details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.

The amount of our accruals for environmental matters are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed and described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. The historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to December 31, 2019 was 9.41 percent. The actual return on assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was 23.44 percent, (5.53) percent, and 19.31 percent, respectively. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements.

The following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2020 (in millions):

-------------------------------------------------------- ---------------- --- --------------------------- --- - --

 Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefits
Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from:
Discount rate decrease of 0.25% $ 134 $ 10
Compensation rate increase of 0.25% 17 n/a
Increase in expense resulting from:
Discount rate decrease of 0.25% 12 —
Expected return on plan assets decrease of 0.25% 6 n/a
Compensation rate increase of 0.25% 4 n/a

Our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spot-rate approach. Under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. If the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $16 million for pension benefits and $2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2020.

See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

Inventory Valuation
The cost of our inventories is principally determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO approach. Our LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our non-LIFO inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The market value of our LIFO inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.
We compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. In determining the market value of our inventories, we assume that feedstocks are converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products. We also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our plants to the appropriate points of sale. We then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. If the aggregate market value is less than cost, we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income.
