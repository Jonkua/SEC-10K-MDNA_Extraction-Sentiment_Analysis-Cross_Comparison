Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019, and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov as well as in the “Investors” section of our corporate website at www.snapon.com.
Non-GAAP Measures
References in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), excluding acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, customer base and geographic expansion, new product development and/or pricing, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. The company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods.
Summary of Consolidated Performance

Consolidated net sales of $3,730.0 million in 2019 decreased $10.7 million, or 0.3%, from 2018 levels, reflecting a $45.4 million, or 1.2%, increase in organic sales and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales, more than offset by $63.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
Operating earnings before financial services of $716.4 million in 2019, including $18.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and an $11.6 million benefit from the settlement of a patent-related litigation matter that was being appealed (the “2019 legal settlement”), decreased $9.6 million, or 1.3%, as compared to $726.0 million last year. Fiscal 2018 results included a $4.3 million benefit related to a legal settlement in an employment-related litigation matter that was being appealed (the “2018 legal settlement”). As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings before financial services of 19.2% in 2019 compared to 19.4% last year.
Operating earnings of $962.3 million in 2019, including $19.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and an $11.6 million benefit for the 2019 legal settlement, increased $6.2 million, or 0.6% from $956.1 million last year. In 2018, operating earnings included a $4.3 million benefit from the 2018 legal settlement. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings of 23.7% compared to 23.5% last year.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Net earnings attributable to Snap-on in 2019 of $693.5 million, or $12.41 per diluted share, increased $13.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, from $679.9 million, or $11.87 per diluted share, in 2018. In 2019, net earnings attributable to Snap-on included $8.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the after-tax benefit related to the 2019 legal settlement. Net earnings attributable to Snap-on in 2018 included $3.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the after-tax benefit related to the 2018 legal settlement, as well as a $4.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, after-tax net gain associated with a treasury lock settlement of $10.0 million related to the issuance of debt, partially offset by $5.9 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of debt (collectively, the “net debt items”), partially offset by $3.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of tax expense for guidance associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) or (“tax charge”).
Impact of the Tax Act
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries; and (iii) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.
The Tax Act also established new tax laws that include, but are not limited to: (i) the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate discussed above; (ii) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iii) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”); (iv) the repeal of the domestic production activity deductions; (v) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (vi) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; and (vii) a new provision that allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction for a portion of its foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”).
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act, for the company’s year ended December 30, 2017. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the related accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for a certain income tax effect of the Tax Act is incomplete, but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.

The company’s accounting for certain elements of the Tax Act was incomplete as of December 30, 2017. However, the company was able to make reasonable estimates of the effects and, therefore, recorded provisional estimates for these items. In connection with its initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, the company recorded a provisional discrete net tax expense of $7.0 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. This provisional estimate consisted of a net expense of $13.7 million for the one-time transition tax and a net benefit of $6.7 million related to revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, caused by the new lower corporate tax rate. To determine the transition tax, the company determined the amount of post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. While the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax for 2017, it continued to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount reported on its 2017 U.S. federal tax return which was filed in October 2018. The actual transition tax was $8.3 million greater than the company’s initial estimate and was included in income tax expense for 2018. Likewise, while the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction to the corporate tax rate, it was affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences. During 2018, the company recorded additional net tax benefits of $4.4 million attributable to pension contributions made in 2018 that were deductible for 2017 at the higher 35% federal tax rate and other changes to the 2017 tax provision related to the Tax Act and subsequently-issued tax guidance. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the company continued to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of ASC 740 throughout 2018. Under GAAP, the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice to either: (i) treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”); or (ii) factor in such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). The company selected to apply the “period cost method” to account for the new GILTI tax, and treated it as a current-period expense for 2019 and 2018.

Summary of Segment Performance
The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide, including customers in the aerospace, natural resources, government, power generation, transportation and technical education market segments (collectively, “critical industries”), primarily through direct and distributor channels. Segment net sales of $1,345.7 million in 2019 increased $2.4 million, or 0.2%, from 2018 levels, reflecting a $32.2 million, or 2.5%, organic sales gain and $3.1 million of acquisition-related sales, mostly offset by $32.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment’s power tools operations, a mid single-digit gain in the specialty tools business and a low single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Operating earnings of $188.7 million in 2019, decreased $10.6 million, or 5.3%, from 2018 levels, primarily due to $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from the company’s RCI initiatives.

The Commercial & Industrial Group intends to continue building on the following strategic priorities in 2020:

•Continuing to invest in emerging market growth initiatives;
•Expanding our business with existing customers and reaching new customers in critical industries and other market segments;
•Broadening our product offering designed particularly for critical industry segments;
•Increasing our customer-connection-driven understanding of work across multiple industries;
•Investing in innovation that, guided by that understanding of work, delivers an ongoing stream of productivity-enhancing custom engineered solutions; and
•Continuing to reduce structural and operating costs, as well as improve efficiencies, through RCI initiatives.
The Snap-on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. Segment net sales of $1,612.9 million in 2019 decreased $0.9 million, or 0.1%, from 2018 levels, reflecting a $14.7 million, or 0.9%, organic sales gain, more than offset by $15.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a low single-digit increase in the segment’s U.S. franchise operations, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the segment’s international operations. Operating earnings of $245.8 million in 2019 decreased $18.4 million, or 7.0%, from 2018 levels primarily due to $11.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher field support investments.

While sales challenges existed in certain geographies throughout 2019, the Snap-on Tools Group remained focused on its fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the franchise network and enhance franchisee profitability. In 2020, the Snap-on Tools Group intends to continue these initiatives, with specific focus on the following:

•Continuing to improve franchisee satisfaction, productivity, profitability and commercial health;
•Developing new programs and products to expand market coverage, reaching new technician customers and increasing penetration with existing customers;
•Increasing investment in new product innovation and development; and
•Increasing customer service levels and productivity in back office support functions, manufacturing and the supply chain through RCI initiatives and investment.
By focusing on these areas, we believe that Snap-on, as well as its franchisees, will have the opportunity to continue to serve customers more effectively, more profitably and with improved satisfaction.
The Repair Systems & Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers worldwide, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships through direct and distributor channels. Segment net sales of $1,334.5 million in 2019 compared to $1,334.4 million in 2018, reflecting a $15.1 million, or 1.1%, organic sales gain and $4.4 million of acquisition-related sales, mostly offset by $19.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase primarily includes low single-digit gains in sales to OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Operating earnings of $342.7 million in 2019, including $3.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.1 million from 2018 levels.

•Maintaining healthy portfolio performance levels.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities of $674.6 million in 2019 decreased $89.9 million from $764.5 million in 2018. The $89.9 million decrease is primarily due to $110.8 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $15.0 million of higher net earnings.

Net cash used by investing activities of $222.1 million in 2019 included additions to finance receivables of $841.9 million, partially offset by collections of $754.3 million, as well as a total of $38.6 million (net of $1.0 million of cash acquired) for the acquisitions of TMB, Power Hawk and Cognitran. Net cash used by investing activities of $210.2 million in 2018 included additions to finance receivables of $865.6 million, partially offset by collections of $747.7 million, as well as a total of $3.0 million for the acquisition of Fastorq. Capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 totaled $99.4 million and $90.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in both years included continued investments to support the company’s execution of its strategic growth initiatives and Value Creation Processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI.

Net cash used by financing activities of $409.4 million in 2019 included $238.4 million for the repurchase of 1,495,000 shares of Snap-on’s common stock and $216.6 million for dividend payments to shareholders, partially offset by $51.4 million of proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises and $17.6 million of net proceeds from other short-term borrowings. Net cash used by financing activities of $502.2 million in 2018 included repayments of $250 million of the unsecured 4.25% notes, due January 16, 2018 (the “2018 Notes”), at maturity, and $200 million of the unsecured 6.70% notes that were scheduled to mature on March 1, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), as well as a $7.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. These amounts were partially offset by Snap-on’s sale, on February 20, 2018, of $400 million of the unsecured 4.10% notes that mature on March 1, 2048 (the “2048 Notes”) at a discount, from which Snap-on received $395.4 million of net proceeds, reflecting $3.5 million of transaction costs. Net cash used by financing activities in 2018 also included $284.1 million for the repurchase of 1,769,000 shares of Snap-on’s common stock, and $192.0 million for dividend payments to shareholders, partially offset by $55.5 million of proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises and $4.9 million of proceeds from a net increase in notes payable and other short-term borrowings.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Snap-on’s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise.
Due to Snap-on’s credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. As of the close of business on February 7, 2020, Snap-on’s long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, A2 and P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service; A- and A-2 by Standard & Poor’s; and A and F1 by Fitch Ratings. Snap-on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. However, Snap-on cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available, or that its debt ratings may not decrease.
The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of 2019 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $1,432.9 million increased $168.0 million from $1,264.9 million as of 2018 year end primarily as a result of other net changes in working capital discussed below.
The following represents the company’s working capital position as of 2019 and 2018 year end:

----------------------------------------- ------- ------- ---- ------- - -------
(Amounts in millions) 2019 2018
Cash and cash equivalents $ 184.5 $ 140.9
Trade and other accounts receivable – net 694.6 692.6
Finance receivables – net 530.1 518.5
Contract receivables – net 100.7 98.3
Inventories – net 760.4 673.8
Prepaid expenses and other assets 110.2 92.8
Total current assets 2,380.5 2,216.9

Notes payable (202.9) (186.3)
Accounts payable (198.5) (201.1)
Other current liabilities (546.2) (564.6)
Total current liabilities (947.6) (952.0)
Working capital $ 1,432.9 $ 1,264.9

Cash and cash equivalents of $184.5 million as of 2019 year end increased $43.6 million from 2018 year-end levels primarily due to: (i) $754.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables; (ii) $674.6 million of cash generated from operations, net of $40.0 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company’s domestic pension plans; (iii) $51.4 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises; and (iv) $17.6 million of net proceeds from other short-term borrowings. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by: (i) the funding of $841.9 million of new finance receivables; (ii) the repurchase of 1,495,000 shares of the company’s common stock for $238.4 million; (iii) dividend payments to shareholders of $216.6 million; (iv) the funding of $99.4 million of capital expenditures; and (v) the funding of $38.6 million for acquisitions.
Of the $184.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 2019 year end, $166.8 million was held outside of the United States. Snap-on maintains non-U.S. funds in its foreign operations to: (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. Although the Tax Act generally eliminates U.S. federal taxation on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, such dividends may still be subject to state income taxation and foreign withholding taxes. Snap-on periodically evaluates its cash held outside the United States and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner.
Trade and other accounts receivable – net of $694.6 million as of 2019 year end increased $2.0 million from 2018 year-end levels primarily due to a total of $3.2 million of receivables related to the Power Hawk and Cognitran acquisitions, partially offset by $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable – net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months sales, times 360 days) was 67 days at both 2019 and 2018 year ends.

-- --------------------
42 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

The current portions of net finance and contract receivables of $630.8 million as of 2019 year end compared to $616.8 million at 2018 year end. The long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of $1,463.6 million as of 2019 year end compared to $1,419.3 million at 2018 year end. The combined $58.3 million increase in net current and long-term finance and contract receivables over 2018 year-end levels is primarily due to continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio and $4.4 million of foreign currency translation.

Inventories – net of $760.4 million as of 2019 year end increased $86.6 million from 2018 year-end levels primarily due to continued support for higher customer demand and new product introductions, as well as a total of $0.6 million of inventories related to the Power Hawk acquisition, partially offset by $3.0 million of foreign currency translation. As of 2019 and 2018 year end, inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 2.6 turns and 2.9 turns, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method as of 2019 and 2018 year end approximated 58% and 61%, respectively, of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The company’s LIFO reserve was $84.5 million and $78.4 million at 2019 and 2018 year end, respectively.

Notes payable of $202.9 million as of 2019 year end included $193.6 million of commercial paper borrowings and $9.3 million of other notes. Notes payable of $186.3 million as of 2018 year end consisted of $177.1 million of commercial paper borrowings and $9.2 million of other notes.

Average notes payable outstanding, including commercial paper borrowings, were $175.0 million and $167.7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2019 year-end weighted-average interest rate on such borrowings of 2.87% compared with 2.84% at 2018 year end. Average commercial paper borrowings were $162.2 million and $154.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the weighted-average interest rate on such borrowings of 2.27% in 2019 increased from 2.03% last year. At 2019 year end, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding notes payable of 2.23% compared with 3.21% at 2018 year end. The 2019 year-end rate decreased primarily due to lower rates on commercial borrowings.

Accounts payable of $198.5 million as of 2019 year end decreased $2.6 million from 2018 year-end levels, primarily due to the timing of payments and $1.3 million of foreign currency translation.

Other accrued liabilities of $370.8 million as of 2019 year end decreased $2.8 million from 2018 year-end levels primarily due to lower income tax accruals and $0.7 million of foreign currency translation.

Long-term debt of $946.9 million as of 2019 year end consisted of: (i) $250.0 million of unsecured 6.125% notes that mature in 2021; (ii) $300.0 million of the unsecured 3.25% notes that mature on March 1, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”); and (iii) $400 million of the 2048 Notes, partially offset by $3.1 million from the net effects of debt amortization costs and fair value adjustments of interest rate swaps.

On September 16, 2019, Snap-on entered into a five-year, $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on September 16, 2024 (the “Credit Facility”); no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 28, 2019. The Credit Facility amended and restated in its entirety Snap-on’s previous $700 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that was set to terminate on December 15, 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on either (i) Snap-on’s then-current, long-term debt ratings; or (ii) Snap-on’s then-current ratio of consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments (“Consolidated Net Debt”) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended (the “Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio”). The Credit Facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of Consolidated Net Debt to the sum of Consolidated Net Debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (the “Leverage Ratio”); or (ii) a Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Snap-on may, up to two times during any five-year period during the term of the Credit Facility (including any extensions thereof), elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio to 0.65 to 1.00 and/or increase the maximum Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions (as defined in the related credit agreement). As of December 28, 2019, the company’s actual ratios of 0.20 and 0.92 respectively, were both within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant. Snap-on generally issues commercial paper to fund its financing needs on a short-term basis and uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support such commercial paper issuances.
Snap-on’s Credit Facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. As of 2019 year end, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of its Credit Facility and other debt agreements.

 ------------------ --
 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 43

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the revolving Credit Facility. Snap-on believes that it can access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. Snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on include scheduled debt payments, payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $8.7 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.9 million to its domestic pension plans in 2020, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2020.
Snap-on’s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations.
The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities of $674.6 million in 2019 decreased $89.9 million from $764.5 million in 2018. The $89.9 million decrease is primarily due to $110.8 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $15.0 million of higher net earnings.
Depreciation expense was $70.1 million in 2019 and $68.8 million in 2018. Amortization expense was $22.3 million in 2019 and $25.3 million in 2018. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities of $222.1 million in 2019 included additions to finance receivables of $841.9 million, partially offset by collections of $754.3 million. Net cash used by investing activities of $210.2 million in 2018 included additions to finance receivables of $865.6 million, partially offset by collections of $747.7 million. Finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees’ customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostic and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, generally with average payment terms of approximately four years.
Net cash used by investing activities in 2019 also included a total of $38.6 million (net of $1.0 million of cash acquired) for the acquisitions of TMB, Power Hawk and Cognitran. Net cash used by investing activities in 2018 included a total of $3.0 million for the acquisition of Fastorq. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquisitions.
Capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 totaled $99.4 million and $90.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in both years included continued investments related to the company’s execution of its strategic growth initiatives and Value Creation Processes. The company also invested in: (i) new product, efficiency, safety and cost reduction initiatives that are intended to expand and improve its manufacturing and distribution capabilities worldwide; (ii) new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment, particularly in the United States; (iii) the ongoing replacement and enhancement of the company’s global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems; and (iv) a new expanded facility for the company’s repair information business in San Diego, California. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2020.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities of $409.4 million in 2019 included net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $17.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $502.2 million in 2018 included repayments of $250 million of the 2018 Notes at maturity and $200 million of the 2019 Notes prior to maturity, as well as a $7.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. These amounts were partially offset by Snap-on’s sale, on February 20, 2018, of $400 million of the 2048 Notes at a discount, from which Snap-on received $395.4 million of net proceeds, reflecting $3.5 million of transaction costs, and $4.9 million of proceeds from the net increase in notes payable and other short-term borrowings.

-- --------------------
44 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

Proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises totaled $51.4 million in 2019 and $55.5 million in 2018. Snap-on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and franchisee stock purchase plans, stock options and other corporate purposes. In 2019, Snap-on repurchased 1,495,000 shares of its common stock for $238.4 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of 2019 year end, Snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $359.6 million in common stock pursuant to its Board of Directors’ (the “Board”) authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap-on repurchased 1,769,000 shares of its common stock for $284.1 million in 2018. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company’s share repurchases, if any, in 2020.
Snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2019 and 2018 totaled $216.6 million and $192.0 million, respectively. On November 8, 2019, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13.7% to $1.08 per share ($4.32 per share annualized). Quarterly dividends in 2019 were $1.08 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.95 per share in the first three quarters ($3.93 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends in 2018 were $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.82 per share in the first three quarters ($3.41 per share for the year).

---------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- --- - ----
 2019 2018
Cash dividends paid per common share $ 3.93 $ 3.41
Cash dividends paid as a percent of prior-year retained earnings 5.1 % 5.1 %

Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2020.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
Except as included below in the section labeled “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company had no off-balance-sheet arrangements as of 2019 year end.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
A summary of Snap-on’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2019 year end are as follows:

--------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ---- --------- ----- --------- ------------------ ----- ----- ---- - -------
(Amounts in millions) Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 2025 andthereafter

Snap-on intends to make contributions of $8.7 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.9 million to its domestic pension plans in 2020, as required by law.  Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2020.  Snap-on has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions; see Note 11 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments.
Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, Snap-on is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities. As a result, $10.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Environmental Matters
Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap-on’s operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Snap-on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.
New Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Snap-on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of April month end.
Snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Within its four reportable operating segments, the company has identified 11 reporting units.

-- --------------------
46 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

Snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units, which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, working capital levels, expected benefits from RCI initiatives, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2019 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. Snap-on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction.
In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value.
Snap-on also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite-lived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates, expected synergies, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested. The company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2019 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. Snap-on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction.
Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets, significant changes in key personnel or litigation, a significant and sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit, some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap-on’s financial position or results of operations.
Snap-on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2019, which did not result in any impairment. As of 2019 year end, the company has no accumulated impairment losses. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. Based on the company’s second quarter 2019 impairment testing, and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets.
Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap-on’s control, such as changes in economic conditions, and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap-on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate.

Snap-on’s domestic pension plans have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective. In 2019, the long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 7.45% domestic expected return on plan assets assumption. Snap-on uses a three-year, market-related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets. As of 2019 year end, Snap-on’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 87% of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets.

 ------------------ --
 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 47

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)

Based on forward-looking capital market expectations, Snap-on selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its U.S. pension plans of 7.25%, a decrease of 20 bps from 2019, to be used in determining pension expense for 2020. In estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets, Snap-on utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation) terms. This process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class. These premiums, calculated using the geometric mean, are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels, macro-economic conditions, and the expected alpha related to active investment management. The asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investment-related expenses. Since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns, the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption.
Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap-on’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on’s 2019 domestic pension expense by approximately $5.6 million.
The objective of Snap-on’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The domestic discount rate as of 2019 and 2018 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions. This methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, AA rated or better, corporate bonds from either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date. This technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate.
The selection of the 3.4% weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s domestic pension plans as of 2019 year end (compared to 4.4% as of 2018 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on’s 2019 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $4.3 million and $74.2 million, respectively. As of 2019 year end, Snap-on’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83% of Snap-on’s worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s foreign pension plans of 2.1% (compared to 3.0% as of 2018 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on’s 2019 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.6 million and $26.8 million, respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants. Prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants.
To determine the 2020 net periodic benefit cost, Snap-on is using weighted-average discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 3.4% and 2.1%, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 7.25%. The expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 1.3% to 5.7% as of 2019 year end. The net change in these two key assumptions from those used in 2019 is expected to increase pension expense in 2020. Other factors, such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions, may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2020. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans.

48 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on Finance Receivables: The allowance for doubtful accounts on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in Snap-on’s finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date. The allowance represents management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. Determination of the proper level of the allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the expense for credit losses and, as a result, net earnings. The allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type, historical loss experience, loss migration, delinquency trends, collection experience, current economic conditions and credit risk characteristics. Some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau and proprietary Snap-on credit model information, as well as the value of the underlying collateral. Changes in economic conditions and assumptions, including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivable portfolio create uncertainty and could result in a change to both the allowance for doubtful accounts and expense for credit losses.

Management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled, reviewed and consistently applied. As of December 28, 2019, the ratio of the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables was 3.65%. As of December 29, 2018, the allowance ratio was 3.71%. While management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimate for the allowance for finance receivables, there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation. For reference, a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratio for finance receivables as of December 28, 2019, would have increased Snap-on’s 2019 expense for credit losses and related allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $16.9 million.
For additional information on Snap-on’s allowances for credit losses, see Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Outlook
Snap-on expects to make continued progress in 2020 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2020 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million.
Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief.

The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class a...

[Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements]:
(4) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $840.0 million, $780.1 million, and $694.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 32 ------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------- Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2020 Earnings per share - diluted $5.15 to $5.25 Impact of special charges 0.05 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $5.20 to $5.30 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...
