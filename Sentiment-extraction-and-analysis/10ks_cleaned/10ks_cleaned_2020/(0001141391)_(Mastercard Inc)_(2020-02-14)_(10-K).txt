ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations.
Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.
Our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8; and Part II, Item 7 (Business Environment).
Cash Flow
The table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31:

----------------------------------------- ------------- ----- ---- ------ ---- ----- ------ - - -----

 2019 2018 2017
 (in millions)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,183 $ 6,223 $ 5,664
Net cash used in investing activities (1,640 ) (506 ) (1,781 )
Net cash used in financing activities (5,867 ) (4,966 ) (4,764 )

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.0 billion in 2019 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non-cash items.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.1 billion in 2019 versus the prior year, primarily due to acquisitions and purchases of equity investments, partially offset by higher net proceeds from our investments in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $901 million in 2019 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher repurchases of our Class A common stock, higher dividends paid and the settlement of the contingent consideration attributable to our 2017 acquisitions, partially offset by higher net debt proceeds in the current period.
Debt and Credit Availability
In May 2019, we issued $1.0 billion principal amount of notes due June 2029 and $1.0 billion principal amount of notes due June 2049 and in December 2019, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due March 2025. Additionally, during 2019, $500 million of principal related to the 2014 USD Notes matured and was paid. Our total debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at December 31, 2019, with the earliest maturity of $650 million of principal occurring in November 2021.
As of December 31, 2019, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $6 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in November 2024.
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2019.
See Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.
Dividends and Share Repurchases
We have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating

 (in millions, except per share data)
Cash dividend, per share $ 1.32 $ 1.00 $ 0.88
Cash dividends paid $ 1,345 $ 1,044 $ 942

On December 4, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share paid on February 7, 2020 to holders of record on January 9, 2020 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $403 million.
On February 4, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on May 8, 2020 to holders of record on April 9, 2020 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $402 million.
Repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. In December 2019, 2018 and 2017, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to $8.0 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of our Class A common stock. The program approved in 2019 became effective in January 2020 after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2018. The following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations of our Class A common stock through December 31, 2019, under the plans approved in 2018 and 2017:

-------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ------

 (in millions, except per share data)
Remaining authorization at December 31, 2018 $ 6,801
Dollar-value of shares repurchased in 2019 $ 6,497
Remaining authorization at December 31, 2019 $ 8,304
Shares repurchased in 2019 26.4

See Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

- -----------------------------------------
5 The table does not include the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Payment related to a definitive agreement to acquire the majority of the Corporate Services business of Nets Denmark A/S, for €2.85 billion (approximately $3.19 billion as of December 31, 2019) as the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. See Note 2 (Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $203 million as of December 31, 2019. These amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated and the timing of these payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities. See Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Litigation provision of $914 million as of December 31, 2019 as the timing of payments is not fixed and determinable. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Future cash payments that will become due to customers and merchants under business agreements as the amounts due are contingent on future performance. We have accrued $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 related to these customer and merchant agreements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.
Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives
We enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or support when customers meet certain volume thresholds as well as other support incentives, which are tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction - based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Loss Contingencies
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.
Income Taxes
In calculating our effective income tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.
We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.
Deferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. Ultimately, the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.
Business Combinations
We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques included comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management’s judgment. The significance of management’s estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

Note 22. Deconsolidation of RBH: As discussed in Note 18. Contingencies, following the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Québec in two class action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. ("RBH"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019. This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense was included in marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment. RBH's share of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million. On March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. PMI has also determined that it does not exert "significant influence" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures). Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readi...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...
