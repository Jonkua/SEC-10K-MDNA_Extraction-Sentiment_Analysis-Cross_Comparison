General Operating Comments

2019 marked
the Company’s 22nd consecutive year of improved revenues. Revenues for the year rose 10.6 percent to $2.015 billion compared
to $1.822 billion for the prior year. Income before income taxes decreased 16.0% to $261.2 million compared to $310.7 million
the prior year. Net income decreased 12.2% to $203.3 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.62 compared to $231.7 million,
or  $0.71 per diluted share for the prior year.

All of
the Company’s business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 11.3%, commercial
pest control revenues up 8.9% and termite and ancillary services revenues up 11.6%, each compared to 2018.

Results of
Operations—2019 Versus 2018

Overview

The
Company’s revenues increased to $2.015 billion in 2019, a 10.6% increase compared to 2018. Gross margin decreased to
50.7% for 2019 from 50.9% in 2018. Service salaries and personnel related expenses for the 401(k) match were impacted by the Clark Pest Control acquisition. Sales, general and administrative expense were 30.9% of revenues in 2019 compared to 30.2% in 2018.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization expense increased 21.4% to 4.0% in 2019 compared to 3.7%
in 2018. Rollins’ net income of $203.3 million in 2019 was a decrease of $28.3 million or 12.2% compared to $231.7
million in 2018. Net profit margin declined to 10.1% in 2019 from 12.7% in 2018. Rollins continued to expand our global brand
recognition with acquisitions in the United States and Canada as well as expanded our Orkin international franchise program
in numerous countries around the globe. In our first 50 years, we have grown to over 2.4 million customers who are served in
65 countries, and those countries represent 73.6% of the world’s GDP. The Company continues to seek new international
opportunities.

Revenues

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.015 billion, an increase of $194 million or 10.6% from 2018 revenues of $1.822 billion.
Growth occurred across all service lines with our Canadian and Australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rates. Growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.8% of our increase, and our acquisitions contributed the remaining
revenue growth. Commercial pest control represented approximately 38% of the Company’s revenue in 2019 and grew 8.9%. Acquisitions
from foreign companies, which are primarily commercial, contributed to the increase, as well as increases in sales, an emphasis
on closing leads, and better cancellation rates. Commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange
rates as our foreign companies are heavily commercial. Residential pest control, which represented approximately 43% of the Company’s
revenue, increased 11.3% driven largely by the Clark Pest Control acquisition, which is mainly residential. Other factors such
as increases in leads received, leads sold, a lower cancellation rate, and pricing, as well as increased TAEXX®
homebuilder installations also contributed to the increase in residential pest control revenue. The Company’s termite business,
which represented approximately 18% of the Company’s revenue, grew 11.6% in 2019 due to acquisitions, increases in termite
baiting, and ancillary service sales (such as moisture control, insulation and deck and gutter work).

15

The Company
implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2019. Around 1% of the Company’s revenue increase is attributable
to pricing actions. Approximately 80% of the Company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2019, as well as 2018.

The Company’s
foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2019 for a total of 97 Orkin international
franchises, one Canadian Critter Control franchise, and ten Australia franchises at December 31, 2019, compared to 86 Orkin international
franchises, two Canadian Critter Control franchises and ten Australia franchises at December 31, 2018. The Australia franchises
operate under the Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Management names.

International
and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s revenues for 2019. Orkin had 147 and 133 franchises (domestic
and international) at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had 84 Critter Control franchises at December 31,
2019, up 4 from 2018. Revenue from franchising was up 3.2% in 2019 compared to 2018 as the Company continued to expand Orkin’s
international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees.

Cost
of Services Provided

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019, cost of services provided increased $99.2 million or 11.1%, compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2018. Gross margin for the year decreased to 50.7% for 2019 compared to 50.9% for 2018 due to increased participation
rates in our enhanced 401(k) match to employees and an increase in group insurance premiums in 2019. Integration of acquisitions
resulted in slight increases in service salaries percentages.

Depreciation
and Amortization

For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization increased $14.3 million, or 21.4% compared to the twelve months
ended December 31, 2018. The dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $6.3 million or 20.7% from the depreciation
of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various IT related projects. Amortization of intangible assets increased
$8.0 million or 22.1% for 2019 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last
year, including a full year of OPC Services and Aardwolf Pestkare, acquired in early and mid-2018, respectively, and the 2019
acquisition of Clark Pest Control in April, as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies.

Sales,
General and Administrative

For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $72.7 million, or 13.2%
compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. SG&A increased to 30.9% of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2019 compared to 30.2% in 2018. The Company incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and
integration as well as expenses related to the pension settlement activities. The enhanced 401(k) match enticed more of the Company’s
workforce to save for their futures. Administrative salaries were up due to increased office headcount and wages. Medical and
casualty insurance expenses were up for the year. The Company also had increased use of outside professional services in IT projects
as well as other projects.

Gain
on Sales of assets, Net

Gain
on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million in 2018. The Company
recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2019 and 2018.

16

Interest Expense, Net

Interest
expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.9 million, driven largely by new borrowings to fund acquisitions, among
other things. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company earned $0.2 million in net interest income on cash balances in
the Company’s various cash accounts.

Taxes

The Company’s
effective tax rate was 22.1% in 2019 compared to 25.4% in 2018, due primarily to state and foreign income taxes and beneficial
adjustments related to the pension settlement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash
and Cash Flow

Cash from
operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.

The most
significant source of cash in Rollins’ cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is
collecting cash resulting from services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees,
tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

The Company’s
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $94.3 million, $115.5 million, and $107.1 million, respectively.

Net increase(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (21,209 ) $ 8,435 $ (35,735 )

Cash Provided
by Operating Activities

The Company’s
operations generated cash of $309.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily from net income of $203.3 million,
compared with cash provided by operating activities of $286.3 million in 2018 and $235.4 million in 2017. The Company believes
its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities, available
borrowings under its $175.0 million revolving credit facility and $250.0 million term loan facility will be sufficient to finance
its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.

The Company
settled its obligations under the Rollins, Inc. Pension Plan without making any additional contributions during the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. The plan was fully funded with a prepaid balance. The plan assets exceeded the plan benefit obligations,
and $31.8 million remained after the combination of lump sum payments to participants, the purchase of a group annuity contract,
and payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Company has evaluated the ERISA allowable opportunities for utilization
of the excess pension assets including funding other employee benefits. The Company used $11.0 million of the $31.8 million to
fund its 401(k) match obligation during the year ended December 31, 2019, and plans to continue funding future benefit plan obligations,
with a possible reversion of any remaining pension assets to the Company per ERISA regulations.

The
Company has one small remaining pension in one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and made a contribution of $0.1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2019. No contributions were made during 2018 or 2017. While the Company’s management does not
expect to make a contribution to its remaining pension plan during fiscal year 2020, additional Plan contributions, if any, will
not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

17

Cash
Used in Investing Activities

The Company
used $455.1 million in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $101.4 million and $154.2 million
during 2018 and 2017, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $27.1 million in capital expenditures during 2019 compared
to $27.2 million and $24.7 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily
of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $28 million
and $30 million in 2020 in capital expenditures. During 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries acquired Clark Pest Control as
well as several other small to mid-sized companies for a total of $430.6 million compared to $76.8 million and $130.2 million
in acquisitions during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The expenditures for the Company’s acquisitions were funded through
existing cash balances, borrowings on our line of credit, a term loan, and other operating cash flows. The Company continues to
seek new acquisitions.

Cash
From Financing Activities

The
Company generated cash of $127.7 million from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to using
$162.3 million and $130.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company borrowed $291.5 million throughout 2019, net of repayments,
primarily to fund the investing activities notes above. A total of
$153.8 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.47 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2019 including a special
dividend paid in December 2019 of $0.05 per share, compared to $152.7 million in cash dividends paid ($0.47 per share) during
the year ended December 31, 2018, including a special dividend paid in December 2018 of $0.09 per share and $122.0 million
paid in cash dividends ($0.37 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2017, including a special dividend paid in
December 2017 of $0.07 per share.

The Company
did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. There remain 7.6 million shares,
adjusted for the December 10, 2018 three-for-two stock split, authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. The Company
repurchased $10.0 million, $9.5 million, and $8.2 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

The Company’s
$94.3 million of total cash at December 31, 2019 is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $74.1 million
is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $20.2 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may
exceed federally insured amounts.

The Company’s
international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment
of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company’s current business plan.

Rollins
maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic
operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The Company
views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances
that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:

Accrual
for Termite Contracts—The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications,
repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors
that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number
of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company’s business practices. However, it is not possible
to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term
accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.

Accrued
Insurance—The Company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers’
compensation and vehicle liability. Risks above specified limits are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated
group captive insurance member arrangement. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program
are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the
claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The
Company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability
based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with
management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management’s
judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control. Additionally, historical
information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management
to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment
screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random
and post incident drug testing, increased driver training and post-injury nurse triage for
work-related injuries.

19

Revenue
Recognition— the Company’s Revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of
promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those
products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are
distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

More on
the Company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the Company’s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies with the heading Revenue Recognition.

Contingency
Accruals—The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 450 “Contingencies,” Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the
litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately
predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation
are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management,
the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated statements of financial position.

Defined
benefit pension plans — The Company had two defined benefit pension plans; the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan
and the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan.

The Company ceased all future benefit
accruals under the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan, in 2005, but remained obligated to provide employees benefits earned
through June 2005. During 2018, the Company initiated the process to transition its pension plan to an insurance provider. At
December 31, 2018, the Company utilized a termination liability approach. This approach reflected the estimated impact of the
distribution of benefits due to a standard termination. Plan liabilities were to be settled through the purchase of annuities
from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible participants that elected to receive such
a form of payment. Discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and 4.11% per year for participants with deferred
benefits were selected by the plan sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases.
The discount rates reflected the single effective interest rate that produced the same present value as that produced when the
expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity were discounted with the FTSE Yield Curve (formerly Citigroup)
as of the measurement date. To determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments, the expected
future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the IRC 417(e) Mortality Table for 2019, were discounted
with the IRC 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of November 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%). Only 50% of active, 30% of
deferred vested, and 25% of retired participants that were eligible to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit
upon plan termination, were assumed to elect this form of payment.

The
plan was settled during 2019 through a combination of lump sum payments to participants, the purchase of a group annuity contract,
and payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

The
Company’s sole remaining defined benefit pension plan is the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan. This Plan
was amended, effective September 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. The Company accounts for these
defined benefit plans in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 715 “Compensation- Retirement Benefits,” and engages an
outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant
assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors,
and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

20

The Company
chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the
investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets
and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects
future pension expense. The Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from
the prior year.

Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employees Pension Plan utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the
Company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate
bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates
the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum
as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 4.70% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 4.05% in both 2018 and
2017. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligation.

As set
forth in Note 16 to the Company’s financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan’s investments
are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These
investments are categorized as investments at net asset value (“NAV”) and are valued using significant non-observable
inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2009-12 “Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent),”
these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These
valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect
valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’
judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness.

The Waltham
Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan had a net pension liability of $0.8 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2019 and
2018 respectively. The recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by $75.6
million before tax and $45.9 million after tax, driven mainly by the Rollins, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan settlement.

Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.
