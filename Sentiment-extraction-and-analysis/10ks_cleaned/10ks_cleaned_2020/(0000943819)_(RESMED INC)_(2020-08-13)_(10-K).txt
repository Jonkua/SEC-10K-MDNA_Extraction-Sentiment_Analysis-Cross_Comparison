ITEM 7MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.

We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. Sleep apnea includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.

Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, portable oxygen concentrators and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of sleep apnea and other respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns.

We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2020, we invested $201.9 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.8% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. During fiscal year 2020, we released new products including AirFit N30, a nasal cradle mask with a front-facing tube, and AirFit F30i, a top-of-head connected full face mask as well as expanded our AirView offering to include certain respiratory care devices. Due to multiple acquisitions, including of Brightree in April 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst in July 2018 and MatrixCare in November 2018, our operations now include out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our SaaS business. These products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.

We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”).

Net revenue in fiscal year 2020 increased to $2,957.0 million, an increase of 13% compared to fiscal year 2019. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $1,717.8 million, from $1,494.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase $223.7 million or 15%. Our net income for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $621.7 million or $4.27 per diluted share compared to net income of $404.6 million or $2.80 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2019.

Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2020 was $802.3 million and at June 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $463.2 million. At June 30, 2020, our total assets were $4.6 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $2.5 billion. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share during fiscal 2020 with a total amount of $225.1 million paid to stockholders.

In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report for the Year Ended June 30, 2019, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 18, 2019.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Impact of COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic. Our primary goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is the preservation of life. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our employees and continuing to use our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the challenges the pandemic poses.

We have observed increased demand for our ventilator devices and masks, which can be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Due to governments’ varying restrictions on international and domestic travel, access to labor for our manufacturing facilities was impacted as was the availability of raw materials and components, which constrained our manufacturing capacity and restricted our ability to initially meet the substantial demand for ventilators. Our primary focus is maximizing the availability of our ventilators and other respiratory support devices for the patients that need them the most in the countries facing the greatest challenges. The global increase in our sales for these respiratory care products during fiscal year 2020 generally followed infection patterns around the world. We believe the global demand for these devices has largely been met, however, this may change depending on the ability for regions to contain and control infection rates, which remains highly uncertain. Additionally, as more becomes known about the virus and as governments pursue testing and vaccines, we may see an overall reduction in demand, and then face a corresponding risk of oversupply by us and by our competitors. While further outbreaks in the future are highly uncertain, we expect lower demand for ventilator products for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.

As anticipated, we observed lower demand for our sleep devices and masks during the three months ended June 30, 2020, and we continue to expect COVID-19 will lead to a temporary decrease in demand for these products from new patients for some or all of our fiscal year 2021. Specifically, diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment, including HME suppliers and sleep clinics, have been impacted and, in some instances, been required, or in the future may be required, to temporarily close due to governments’ “shelter-in-place” orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions enacted to control the spread of COVID-19. In some countries, new patients are prescribed sleep apnea treatment through hospitals that are directing their resources to critical care, including COVID-19 treatment. The impact on these diagnostic and prescription pathways has likely resulted in a decrease in demand from new patients for our products designed to treat sleep apnea. Given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19, we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of decreased demand for our sleep devices. However, due to the nature of the installed base of existing patients using our devices, we expect the demand for re-supply of our masks to be less impacted compared to devices.

Our SaaS business may also be affected by COVID-19 and measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19. Some of our existing and potential SaaS customers are HME distributors and, therefore, have been impacted, or may be impacted, by the same temporary business closures noted above. We also have existing and potential SaaS customers that operate care facilities and are either receiving and treating patients infected with COVID-19 or are implementing significant measures to safeguard their facilities against a potential COVID-19 outbreak. Given these challenging business conditions and the uncertain economic environment, we expect businesses will be deterred from adopting new or changing SaaS platforms, which may adversely impact our ability to engage new customers for our SaaS businesses, or expand the services used by existing customers.

Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees. We have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide, but since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, we were able to broadly maintain our operations, and we are beginning the slow and careful process of progressively returning to work in our offices around the world. The pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position.

Sleep and Respiratory Care
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased to $2,602.4 million from $2,330.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $271.6 million or 12%. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $29.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the impact of currency movements, total net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased by 13% compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including as a result of increased demand for our ventilators due to COVID-19.

Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in the United States, Canada and Latin America for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased to $1,572.3 million from $1,420.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $151.8 million or 11%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including as a result of increased demand for our ventilators due to COVID-19.

Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in markets in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $1,030.1 million from $910.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $119.8 million or 13% (an increase of 16% on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks, including as a result of increased demand for our ventilators due to COVID-19.

Net revenue from devices for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased to $1,507.8 million from $1,361.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $146.2 million or 11%, including an increase of 7% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 16% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (a 19% increase on a constant currency basis).

Software as a Service
Net revenue from our SaaS business for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $354.6 million, compared to $275.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $78.8 million or 29%. The increase was predominantly due to revenue attributable to MatrixCare, which was acquired on November 13, 2018, and continued growth in our SaaS product offerings.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin.    Within our consolidated statements of income for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, cost of sales has been adjusted to include amortization of acquired intangible assets directly applicable to revenue. As a result, gross profit now includes amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and operating expenses have been reduced by this amount. There was no impact on income from operations, income before taxes or net income, as a result of this reclassification. The adjustments to the previously reported amounts are not material.

The table below presents a reconciliation of amortization of acquired intangible assets by income statement caption summing to total amortization of acquired intangible assets as previously reported for the year ended June 30, 2019 (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ------
 2019
Amortization of acquired intangible assets related to cost of sales $ 42,514
Amortization of acquired intangible assets related to operating expenses 32,424
Total as previously reported $ 74,938

The table below presents a reconciliation of gross profit as previously reported for the year ended June 30, 2019 adjusted for the amortization of acquired intangible assets now included in cost of sales (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---------
 2019
Gross profit as previously reported $ 1,536,585
Amortization of acquired intangible assets related to cost of sales (42,514)
Gross profit $ 1,494,071

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $1,717.8 million from $1,494.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $223.7 million or 15%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 58.1% for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared with the 57.3% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to favorable product mix, which was partially offset by an increase in manufacturing and logistics costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with MatrixCare and Propeller Health, which were acquired in November 2018 and January 2019, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $676.7 million from $645.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $31.7 million or 5%. The selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in U.S. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $15.1 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased by 7% compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 improved to 22.9% compared to 24.7% for the year ended June 30, 2019.

The constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs and travel, marketing and consulting expenses, either as a direct or indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research and Development Expenses.    Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $201.9 million from $180.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $21.3 million or 12%. The research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $4.4 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased by 14% compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 6.9% for the year ended June 30, 2019.

The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the consolidation of our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health as well as additional personnel to facilitate development of new products and solutions.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets.    Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $30.1 million compared to $32.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in amortization expense was attributable to our historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year.

Restructuring Expenses.    During the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not incur material restructuring expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we incurred restructuring expenses of $9.4 million associated with the reorganization, rationalization and relocation of some of our research and development and SaaS operations including the closure of our German research and development site. We recorded the full amount of $9.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019, within our operating expenses, which was separately disclosed as restructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments to employees and contract exit costs associated with several impacted sites.

Acquisition Related Expenses.     During the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not incur material acquisition related expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized acquisition related expenses of $6.1 million associated primarily with our acquisition of MatrixCare.

Litigation Settlement Expenses.    During the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not incur material litigation settlement expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized litigation settlement expenses of $41.2 million on account of a tentative agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve an ongoing investigation by the government into certain of our product offerings. The final agreement, entered into in December 2019, included payment by us of $39.5 million, and additional fees and administrative costs raising the overall total to $41.2 million.

Total Other Income (Loss), Net.    Total other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2020 was a loss of $76.6 million, compared to a loss of $60.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The change was due primarily to an increase in losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2020 of $25.1 million, compared to $15.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The losses attributable to equity method investments relate to our joint venture with Verily whereby we recognize our share of the joint venture’s losses. Additionally, interest expense increased to $40.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to interest expense of $36.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.

Income Taxes.    Our effective income tax rate decreased to 15.2% for the year ended June 30, 2020 from 22.0% for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective income tax rate was affected by the geographic mix of our earnings and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards. Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated.

Finally, in connection with the audit by the Australian Tax Office (the “ATO”) for the tax years 2009 to 2013, we received Notices of Amended Assessments in March 2018. Based on these assessments, the ATO asserted that we owe $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest, of which $75.9 million was paid in April 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ATO. As of June 30, 2020, we have recorded a receivable in prepaid taxes and other non-current assets for the amount paid as we ultimately expect this will be refunded by the ATO. In June 2018, we received a notice from the ATO claiming penalties of 50% of the additional income tax that was assessed or $75.9 million. The ATO is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2018. We do not agree with the ATO’s assessments and continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position.

Net Income and Earnings per Share.    As a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $621.7 million compared to net income of $404.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $4.27 compared to $2.80 for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of 53%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $463.2 million and $147.1 million, respectively. Working capital was $920.7 million and $589.4 million, at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 we had $1.2 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term credit facility and senior notes as compared to $1.3 billion at June 30, 2019. In response to the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased our cash and cash equivalents position during the year by drawing down from our revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2020, we had $1.1 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $1.5 billion in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility.

As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the United States amounted to $158.8 million and $33.6 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, of $304.4 million and $113.5 million, respectively, were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.

We repatriated $400.0 million and $360.0 million to the United States during both the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the United States in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2021 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the United States, such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.

During the year ended June 30, 2018, as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated. On June 14, 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued final and temporary regulations relating to the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. As a result, in the event our non-U.S. earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $194.4 million in U.S. federal deferred tax and $5.2 million in U.S. state deferred taxes would have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Inventories at June 30, 2020 were $416.9 million, an increase of $67.3 or 19% over the balance at June 30, 2019 of $349.6 million. The increase in inventories was required primarily to support our revenue growth, including increased demand for our ventilators due to COVID-19.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at June 30, 2020 were $474.6 million, a decrease of $53.9 million or 10% over the June 30, 2019 accounts receivable balance of $528.5 million. Accounts receivable days’ sales outstanding of 65 days at June 30, 2020 decreased by 2 days compared to 67 days at June 30, 2019. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 5.7% and 4.5%, respectively.

Effective July 1, 2019, we adopted the Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). As of June 30, 2020, and in accordance with the new guidance, we have recognized a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) of $118.3 million and a lease liability of $123.1 million on the balance sheet for all operating leases, other than those that meet the definition of a short-term lease.

During the year ended June 30, 2020, we generated cash of $802.3 million from operations compared to $459.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cash generated from operations during the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to the increase in operating profit and improvement in working capital, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended June 30, 2020 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $10.9 million, as reported in U.S. dollars.

During the year ended June 30, 2020, we paid $27.9 million associated with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, compared to $951.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019.

We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program and, accordingly, did not repurchase any shares during year ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 200,000 shares at a cost of $22.8 million under our share repurchase program. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we also paid dividends totaling $225.1 million and $211.7 million, respectively.

Details of contractual obligations at June 30, 2020 are as follows (in thousands):

Segment Information

We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the SaaS segment. See Note 15 – Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Credit Facility

On April 17, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, joint book runner, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner. The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $800.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million.

Additionally, on April 17, 2018, ResMed Limited entered into a syndicated facility agreement, or the Term Credit Agreement, as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million.

On November 5, 2018, we entered into a first amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the size of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility from $800.0 million to $1.6 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300.0 million.

Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, and ResMed Limited’s obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement contain customary covenants, including, in each case, a financial covenant that requires that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, as applicable). The entire principal amounts of the revolving credit facility and term credit facility, and, in each case, any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable. Events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement include, in each case, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the respective agreements or related documents, or certain changes of control of us, or the respective guarantors of the obligations borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on April 17, 2023, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. Amounts borrowed under the Term Credit Agreement will also amortize on a semi-annual basis, with a $6.0 million principal payment required on each such semi-annual amortization date. The outstanding principal amounts will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.75% to 1.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable) plus 0.0% to 0.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At June 30, 2020, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amounts was 1.2%. An applicable commitment fee of 0.100% to 0.175% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $680.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement.

Senior Notes

On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029. Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, including ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., Birdie Inc., Inova Labs, Inc., Brightree LLC, Brightree Home Health & Hospice LLC, Brightree Patient Collections LLC, ResMed Operations Inc., HEALTHCAREfirst Holding Company, HCF Holdco Company, HEALTHCAREfirst, Inc., CareFacts Information Systems, LLC and Lewis Computer Services, LLC, MatrixCare Holdings Inc., MatrixCare, Inc., Reciprocal Labs Corporation and ResMed SaaS Inc., under a Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement dated as of July 10, 2019. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement.

Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to customary covenants including with respect to our corporate existence, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and other extraordinary transactions. We also agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, we will maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and will not at any time permit the amount of all secured and unsecured debt of us and our subsidiaries to exceed 10% of our consolidated tangible assets, determined as of the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter.

On June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was a total of $1,180.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and undrawn debt facilities.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.

We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

(1)  Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets.    We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value, and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. We base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.

We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps:

Step 0 or Qualitative assessment – Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Step 1 – Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.

(2)  Income Tax.    We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.  If we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. These changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.

Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Although currently immaterial, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.

In connection with the audit by the ATO for the tax years 2009 to 2013, we received Notices of Amended Assessments in March 2018. Based on these assessments, the ATO asserted that we owe $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest, of which $75.9 million was paid in April 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ATO. In June 2018, we received a notice from the ATO claiming penalties of 50% of the additional income tax that was assessed or $75.9 million. At June 30, 2020, we recorded a receivable in prepaid taxes and other non-current assets for the amount paid as we ultimately expect this will be refunded by the ATO. The ATO is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2018. We do not agree with the ATO’s assessments and continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position.

(3)  Revenue Recognition.    We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g., rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to customers. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. We also recognize discount on products as a reduction to revenue when control is transferred. We adjust the estimate of revenue for the impact of returned items at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, are infrequent and insignificant.

When Sleep and Respiratory Care or SaaS contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Respiratory Care contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...
