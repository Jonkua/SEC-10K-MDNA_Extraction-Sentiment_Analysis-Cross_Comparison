Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements are reasonable and supportable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were prepared. However, uncertainty over the impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy and our business in particular makes many of the estimates and assumptions reflected in our 2020 consolidated financial statements inherently less certain. Therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates to a greater degree than historically.
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”), a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”), constitute our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our transportation segments (FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight) and other business units.
 FISCAL YEARS. Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 or ended May 31 of the year referenced.

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year’s presentation.
 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

Satisfaction of Performance Obligation

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide distinct services within a single contract, primarily transportation services. Substantially all of our contracts with customers for transportation services include only one performance obligation, the transportation services themselves. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. We frequently sell standard transportation services with observable standalone sales prices. In these instances, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.

For transportation services, revenue is recognized over time as we perform the services in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Our customers receive the benefit of our services as the goods are transported from one location to another. If we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed. As control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. For our freight and freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the transfer of control to the customer.

We also provide customized customer-specific solutions, such as supply chain management solutions and inventory and service parts logistics, through which we provide the service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single capability. For these arrangements, the majority of which are conducted by our FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. For these performance obligations, we typically have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date, and as such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.

Contract Modification

Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional distinct services. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable rights and obligations or alters the existing arrangement. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.

Variable Consideration

Certain contracts contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These incentives are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metrics. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts of revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.

Principal vs. Agent Considerations

Transportation services are provided with the use of employees and independent businesses that contract with FedEx. GAAP requires us to evaluate whether our businesses themselves promise to transfer services to the customer (as the principal) or to arrange for services to be provided by another party (as the agent) using a control model. Based on our evaluation of the control model, we determined that FedEx is the principal to the transaction for most of these services and revenue is recognized on a gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer. Costs associated with independent businesses providing transportation services are recognized as incurred and included in the caption “Purchased transportation” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain transportation businesses engage in certain transactions wherein they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions and taxes and duties.

Contract Assets and Liabilities

Contract assets include billed and unbilled amounts resulting from in-transit shipments, as we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance obligations have been completed (e.g., packages have been delivered). Contract assets are generally classified as current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. Our contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue. The full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions.

Gross contract assets related to in-transit shipments totaled $563 million and $533 million at May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Contract assets, net of deferred unearned revenue were $456 million and $364 million at May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Contract assets are included within current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities related to advance payments from customers were $10 million and $11 million at May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. Contract liabilities are included within current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Payment terms

Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes, such as sales tax, assessed by governmental authorities. We present these revenues net of tax. Under the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, the customer pays at periodic intervals (e.g., every 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, etc.) for shipments included on invoices received. It is not customary business practice to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our revenue contracts with customers.

Disaggregation of Revenue

See Note 14 for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the periods ended May 31. This presentation is consistent with how we organize our segments internally for making operating decisions and measuring performance.

It is not customary business practice to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our revenue contracts with customers.
 CREDIT RISK. We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business services without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most of our services. Allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic conditions. Historically, credit losses have been within management’s expectations.
 ADVERTISING. Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were $427 million in 2020, $468 million in 2019 and $442 million in 2018.
 427000000
 468000000
 442000000
 CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.
 SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL. Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete as well as expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. The majority of our supplies and fuel are reported at weighted-average cost.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Expenditures for major additions, improvements and flight equipment modifications are capitalized when such costs are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets as they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft engine maintenance costs incurred under third-party service agreements. These agreements result in costs being expensed based on cycles or hours flown and are subject to annual escalation. These service contracts transfer risk to third-party service providers and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider as a rate per cycle or flight hour, in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. We capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated with the development of internal-use software. Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are classified within operating expenses and historically have been nominal.

For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset’s service life or related lease term, if shorter. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable.

The depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions):

 Net Book Value at May 31,
----------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------------------- ------ ---- - ------
 Range 2020 2019
Wide-body aircraft and related equipment 15 to 30 years $ 13,448 $ 11,975
Narrow-body and feeder aircraft and related equipment 5 to 18 years 2,478 2,696
Package handling and ground support equipment 3 to 30 years 4,499 4,157
Information technology 2 to 10 years 1,795 1,553
Vehicles and trailers 3 to 15 years 4,345 4,042
Facilities and other 2 to 40 years 7,043 6,006

Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of aircraft costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 30 years. We periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment.

Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $3.6 billion in 2020, $3.4 billion in 2019 and $3.1 billion in 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of assets under finance lease.

 CAPITALIZED INTEREST. Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft, including purchase deposits, construction of certain facilities, and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $54 million in 2020, $64 million in 2019 and $61 million in 2018.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.

We operate integrated transportation networks so cash flows for most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment.

In the second quarter of 2020, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 10 Airbus A310-300 aircraft and 12 related engines at FedEx Express to align with the needs of the U.S. domestic network and modernize its aircraft fleet. As a consequence of this decision, we recognized noncash impairment charges of $66 million ($50 million, net of tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) in the FedEx Express segment in the second quarter of 2020. Seven of these aircraft had been temporarily idled.

In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2020, we had 14 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to revenue service.

SALE OF BUSINESS. During 2018, we sold a non-core business of TNT Express B.V. (“TNT Express”) and recorded a gain of $85 million in the FedEx Express segment.

GOODWILL. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter.

See Note 4 for additional information.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology assets and trademarks acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or on a basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets (“EROA”) for interim and segment reporting purposes. Our EROA is a judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate.

The accounting guidance related to employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plans. We use “mark-to-market” or MTM accounting and immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our results annually in the fourth quarter each year. The annual MTM adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and does not impact segment results. The remaining components of pension and postretirement healthcare expense, primarily service and interest costs and the EROA, are recorded on a quarterly basis. Only service cost is recognized in segment level operating results.

INCOME TAXES. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination and, thus, there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The noncurrent portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are recorded in the caption “Other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS. We are self-insured for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and disability programs. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers’ compensation claims, vehicle and general liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense.

LEASES. We lease certain facilities, aircraft, equipment and vehicles under operating and finance leases. A determination of whether a contract contains a lease is made at the inception of the arrangement. Our leased facilities include national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities, retail facilities and administrative buildings.

Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement.

The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.

For real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

See Note 7 for additional information.

DEFERRED GAINS. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on June 1, 2019, gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment were deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense. Substantially all of these deferred gains, which are included in other non-current liabilities, related to aircraft transactions.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. Our risk management strategy includes the select use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects of volatility in foreign currency exchange exposure on operating results and cash flows. In accordance with our risk management policies, we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.

When we become a party to a derivative instrument and intend to apply hedge accounting, we formally document the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge, which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge.

If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in other comprehensive income. For net investment hedges, the entire change in the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income. Any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is considered to be ineffective, along with the change in fair value of any derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, is immediately recognized in the income statement. We do not have any derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge for any period presented. During 2020, we designated €392 million of debt as a net investment hedge to reduce the volatility of the U.S. dollar value of a portion of our net investment in a euro-denominated consolidated subsidiary. As of May 31, 2020, the hedge remains effective.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local currencies as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred income taxes, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) within common stockholders’ investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in the caption “Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each period presented.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The accounting guidance related to share-based payments requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the “Salaries and employee benefits” caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We issue new shares or treasury shares from stock repurchases to cover employee stock option exercises and restricted stock grants.

BUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS. During 2019, we conducted a program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. As a result of this program, approximately 1,500 employees left the Company. Costs of the benefits provided under the U.S.-based voluntary employee buyout program were recognized in 2019 when eligible employees accepted their offers. Payments under this program were made at the time of departure and totaled approximately $50 million in 2020 and $220 million in 2019.

USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation claims; impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill); and that rely on projections of future cash flows and purchase price allocations.

The new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) in 2020 and the efforts to contain it have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted manufacturing operations and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. See Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements are reasonable and supportable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were prepared. However, uncertainty over the impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy and our business in particular makes many of the estimates and assumptions reflected in our 2020 consolidated financial statements inherently less certain. Therefore, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates to a greater degree than historically.

NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new lease accounting standard, which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses in their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. Lessees are required to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Expenses related to leases determined to be operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis, while those determined to be finance leases are recognized following a front-loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement.

We adopted this new standard on June 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition method. Under this approach, we did not adjust the balance sheet for comparative periods but recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on June 1, 2019. We have elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases upon adoption. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our classes of assets. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance. We have made an accounting policy election not to recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the consolidated balance sheet.

The adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of an operating lease liability of $14.2 billion and an operating right-of-use asset of $14.1 billion, with an immaterial impact on our income statement compared to the previous lease accounting model. Existing prepaid asset and net deferred rent liability balances of $154 million and $309 million, respectively, were recorded to the right-of-use asset. The cumulative effect of the adoption to retained earnings was an increase of $57 million ($47 million, net of tax), primarily related to the reclassification of deferred gains related to sale-leasebacks of aircraft. Substantially all of our lease arrangements are operating leases under the new standard. The new standard had a material impact on our balance sheet but did not materially impact consolidated operating results and had no impact on operating cash flows.

See Note 1 “Leases” and Note 7 for additional information.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 that permits companies to reclassify the income tax effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) on items within AOCI to retained earnings. We adopted this new standard on June 1, 2019.

In March 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding financial disclosure requirements for registered debt offerings involving subsidiaries as either issuers or guarantors and affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral. This new guidance narrows the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamlines the alternative disclosures required in lieu of those statements. This rule is effective January 4, 2021 (fiscal 2021) with earlier adoption permitted. We adopted this new standard in the fourth quarter of 2020. Accordingly, summarized financial information has been presented only for the issuer and guarantors of the Company’s registered debt securities for the most recent fiscal year, and the location of the required disclosures has been moved outside the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is provided in the “Financial Condition—Guarantor Financial Information” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

New Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 that changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2020 (fiscal 2021). This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 that reduces the complexity of accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement and aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs of hosting arrangements, regardless of whether they convey a license to the hosted software. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2020 (fiscal 2021) and applied these changes prospectively. This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This standard is effective June 1, 2021 (fiscal 2022). We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2020 (fiscal 2021). This new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 3: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On May 1, 2019, we acquired the international express division of FC (Flying Cargo) Express Ltd. (“Flying Cargo”) for $67 million in cash from operations. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The financial results of this acquired business are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations. Therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.

On October 1, 2018, we acquired the controlling interest in an existing joint venture with Swiss Post, which operates a Swiss-wide transport system with connections to TNT Express’s global network. The controlling interest was acquired through the noncash contribution of a complementary Swiss business into the venture, resulting in the recognition of an immaterial gain. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The financial results of this acquired business are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations. Therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.

On March 23, 2018, we acquired P2P Mailing Limited, a leading provider of worldwide, low-cost e-commerce transportation solutions, for £92 million ($135 million) in cash from operations. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The financial results of this acquired business are included in the FedEx Logistics operating segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations. Therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.

On October 13, 2017, we acquired Northwest Research, Inc., a leader in inventory research and management, for $50 million in cash from operations. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to property and equipment. The financial results of this acquired business are included in the FedEx Services segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations. Therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.

NOTE 4: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL. The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment and changes therein are as follows (in millions):

 FedEx Express Segment FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Freight Segment Corporate, Other and Eliminations Total
---------------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ----- - -------------------- - --- --------------------- - --------------------------------- - ----- ------ - - ------ -
Goodwill at May 31, 2018 $ 5,100 $ 840 $ 767 $ 1,950 $ 8,657

Accumulated goodwill impairment charges as of May 31, 2020 $ — $ — $ (133 ) $ (1,909 ) $ (2,042 )

(1) Goodwill acquired relates to the acquisitions of Flying Cargo and the controlling interest in an existing joint venture with Swiss Post. See Note 3 for more information.

(2) Primarily currency translation adjustments, purchase price allocation-related adjustments, and acquired goodwill related to immaterial acquisitions.

We recorded an impairment charge of $358 million attributable to our FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) and FedEx Supply Chain Distribution System, Inc. (“FedEx Supply Chain”) reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in store closures and declining print revenue at FedEx Office during the fourth quarter of 2020 and is expected to continue to negatively impact its near-term operating performance. Based on these factors, our outlook for the FedEx Office business and retail industry changed in the fourth quarter of 2020, which contributed $348 million to the goodwill impairment charge.

While there are several factors negatively impacting near-term results at FedEx Express, including weak global economic conditions and the timing and amount of TNT Express integration program expenses, FedEx Express continues to be an established profitable business with a fair value that exceeds its carrying value based on our valuation performed during the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2020 and 2019; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates. No impairments of goodwill were recognized in 2019.

In 2018, we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $374 million related to FedEx Supply Chain, eliminating substantially all of the goodwill attributable to this reporting unit. In our evaluation of the goodwill of this reporting unit, we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value was estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income and market approach classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the FedEx Supply Chain business during 2018, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of the acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business and industry changed in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Interest on our U.S. dollar fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Interest on our euro fixed-rate notes is paid annually. The weighted average interest rate on long-term debt was 3.6% as of May 31, 2020. Long-term debt, including current maturities and exclusive of finance leases, had estimated fair values of $22.8 billion at May 31, 2020 and $17.8 billion at May 31, 2019. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification is defined as a fair value determined using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock.

During July 2019, we issued $2.1 billion of senior unsecured debt under our current shelf registration statement, comprised of $1.0 billion of 3.10% fixed-rate notes due in August 2029, €500 million of 0.45% fixed-rate notes due in August 2025 and €500 million of 1.30% fixed-rate notes due in August 2031. We used the net proceeds to make voluntary contributions to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans (“U.S. Pension Plans”) during the first quarter of 2020 and to redeem the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.30% notes due February 1, 2020 and the €500 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% notes due April 9, 2020. The remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.

On March 17, 2020, we entered into an amended and restated $2.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement and a $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The 364-Day Credit Agreement expires in March 2021. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs.

On March 18, 2020, we elected to draw $1.5 billion under the 364-Day Credit Agreement to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility in light of disrupted access to commercial paper markets and uncertainty in the global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

During April 2020, we issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured debt under our current shelf registration statement, comprised of $1.0 billion of 3.80% fixed-rate notes due in May 2025, $750 million of 4.25% fixed-rate notes due in May 2030 and $1.25 billion of 5.25% fixed-rate notes due in May 2050. We used the net proceeds to repay the $1.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement, repay $136 million of commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.

The Credit Agreements contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated earnings (excluding noncash retirement plans MTM adjustments, noncash pension service costs and noncash asset impairment charges) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, calculated as of the end of the applicable quarter on a rolling four-quarters basis. On May 27, 2020, we amended the Credit Agreements to revise the adjusted EBITDA definition to exclude noncash pension service costs (as noted above) and to increase the ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA as follows: 3.75:1.0 at May 31, 2020; 4.75:1.0 at August 31, 2020; 4.9:1.0 at November 30, 2020; 4.75:1.0 at February 28, 2021; and 3.75:1.0 at May 31, 2021, with the ratio reverting to 3.5:1.0 at August 31, 2021 and thereafter. The amendments to the Credit Agreements also contain temporary covenants restricting us from repurchasing any shares of our common stock or increasing the amount of our quarterly dividend payable per share of common stock from $0.65 per share between May 27, 2020 and May 31, 2021. The ratio of our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.0 to 1.0 at May 31, 2020.

We believe the covenants discussed above are the only significant restrictive covenant in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements contain other customary covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the financial covenant and all other covenants in the Credit Agreements and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected funding needs. If we failed to comply with the financial covenant or any other covenants in the Credit Agreements, our access to financing could become limited. We had $250 million of the letter of credit sublimit unused under our revolving credit facility as of May 31, 2020.

As of May 31, 2020, no commercial paper was outstanding.

We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities, retail locations and equipment under finance and operating leases that expire at various dates through 2060. We leased 5% of our total aircraft fleet under operating leases as of May 31, 2020 and 6% as of May 31, 2019. A portion of our supplemental aircraft are leased by us under agreements that provide for cancellation upon 30 days’ notice. Our leased facilities include national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities, retail facilities and administrative buildings.

A summary of future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and finance leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions):

While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.

As of May 31, 2020, FedEx has entered into additional leases which have not yet commenced and are therefore not part of the right-of-use asset and liability. These leases are generally for build-to-suit facilities and have undiscounted future payments of approximately $1.6 billion, and will commence when FedEx gains beneficial access to the leased asset. Commencement dates are expected to be from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022.

FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.

We are the lessee under certain operating leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance and lease these aircraft to us. These leasing entities are variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are at market at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. Therefore, we are not required to consolidate any of these entities as the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary of future minimum lease payments.

NOTE 10: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019 2018
-------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - --- ---- - ---
Stock-based compensation expense $ 168 $ 174 $ 167

We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock.

STOCK OPTIONS. Under the provisions of our incentive stock plan, key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than its fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to four years, with 82% of our options vesting ratably over four years. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

RESTRICTED STOCK. Under the terms of our incentive stock plan, restricted shares of our common stock are awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee’s retirement. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the requisite service period or the stated vesting period.

ASSUMPTIONS. The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The following table includes the weighted-average Black-Scholes value of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions) and the key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for options granted during the years ended May 31, followed by a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in the valuation model:

 2020 2019 2018
------------------------------------ --------- ----- - --------- - ----- --------- - ----- -
Weighted-average Black-Scholes value $ 33.97 $ 61.42 $ 55.72
Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 44 $ 122 $ 359
Black-Scholes Assumptions:
Expected lives 6.4 years 6.4 years 6.5 years
Expected volatility 23 % 21 % 23 %
Risk-free interest rate 1.91 % 2.94 % 2.07 %
Dividend yield 1.630 % 0.935 % 0.796 %

The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we examine actual stock option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Expected volatilities are based on the actual changes in the market value of our stock and are calculated using daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option.

The following table summarizes information regarding stock option activity for the year ended May 31, 2020:

Pre-tax earnings of foreign operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $634 million, $929 million and $958 million, respectively. These amounts represent only a portion of total results associated with international shipments and do not represent our international results of operations.

A reconciliation of total income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2020, 21% in 2019 and 29.2% in 2018) to income before taxes for the years ended May 31 is as follows (in millions):

(1) Primary components in 2018 were a $1.15 billion benefit from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability and a $204 million one-time benefit from a contribution to our U.S. Pension Plans in 2018.

(2) The 2018 net benefit consists of foreign deferred tax benefits of $434 million, which were partially offset by U.S. deferred tax expenses of $179 million.

The 2020 tax rate includes a benefit of $133 million from the reduction of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax loss carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction. The 2020 tax rate also includes a deferred income tax expense of $51 million for a change in deferred tax balances related to future foreign tax credits from our international structure as a result of changes in legal entity forecasts during the fourth quarter. The 2020 tax rate was negatively impacted by decreased earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Among other things, the CARES Act allows a five-year carryback period for tax losses generated in 2019 through 2021. As a result, an income tax benefit of $71 million was recorded in 2020 in connection with a tax loss generated during 2020 that the CARES Act will now allow to be carried back to 2015, a tax year when the U.S. federal income tax rate was 35%.

The 2019 tax rate includes a benefit of $90 million from the reduction of a valuation allowance on tax loss carryforwards due to certain business operational changes from the integration of FedEx Express and TNT Express in a local jurisdiction, which impacted our determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction and an expense of $50 million from the impact on our deferred taxes attributable to a lower tax rate in the Netherlands. The 2019 tax rate was also favorably impacted by the TCJA, which resulted in benefits of approximately $75 million from accelerated deductions claimed on our 2018 U.S. income tax return filed in 2019 and approximately $40 million from the lower statutory tax rate on fiscal 2019 earnings.

The 2018 tax rate was favorably impacted by the TCJA, which resulted in a provisional benefit of $1.15 billion from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability. In addition, we recognized a one-time benefit of $204 million from a $1.5 billion contribution to our U.S. Pension Plans in 2018. Our 2018 tax rate also included a net benefit of $255 million from corporate structuring transactions as part of the ongoing integration of FedEx Express and TNT Express and a benefit of $225 million from foreign tax credits generated by distributions to the U.S. from our foreign operations. The 2018 tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in uncertain tax positions for income tax audits.

The TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly changed the U.S. corporate income tax system by reducing our U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% (due to our May 31 fiscal year-end, the lower rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 29.2% for 2018 and a statutory federal rate of 21% for 2019 and subsequent years).

During 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued final regulations covering the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the TCJA. Certain guidance included in these final regulations is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of a $233 million cumulative benefit through 2019. Notwithstanding this inconsistency, we remain confident in our interpretation of the TCJA and intend to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. However, if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.

In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 to provide guidance to registrants in accounting for income taxes under the TCJA. In accordance with SAB 118, we made reasonable estimates and recorded provisional amounts for the TCJA during 2018. Under the transitional provisions of SAB 118, we had a one-year measurement period to complete the accounting for the initial tax effects of the TCJA. During 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a $4 million tax expense to adjust the $1.15 billion provisional benefit recorded in 2018.

As provided for in the TCJA, our historical earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax and can now be repatriated to the U.S. with a de minimis tax cost. We continue to assert that both our historical and current earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and therefore no deferred taxes or withholding taxes have been provided, including deferred taxes on any additional outside basis difference (e.g., stock basis differences attributable to acquisition or other permanent differences).

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 31 were as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019
---------------------------------------------- ------------------- ----- - ------------------------ - ----- ------------------- - ------------------------ - - -----
 Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities

 $ 7,305 $ 9,120 $ 3,492 $ 4,973

(1) Includes impact from adoption of the new lease accounting standard in 2020. See Note 7 for additional information.

The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019
----------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ------ -
Noncurrent deferred tax assets(1) $ 1,347 $ 1,340
Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities (3,162 ) (2,821 )
 $ (1,815 ) $ (1,481 )

(1) Noncurrent deferred tax assets are included in the line item “Other Assets” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We have approximately $3.6 billion of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions and $1.1 billion of state operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowances primarily represent amounts reserved for operating loss carryforwards, which expire over varying periods starting in 2021. Therefore, we establish valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 above for more information on our policy for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently auditing our 2016 and 2017 tax returns. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The expected impact of any changes would not be material to our consolidated financial statements. During 2020, the IRS closed the audit of our 2014 and 2015 income tax returns. The settlement of this audit did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019 2018
----------------------------------------------------- ---- --- - ---- - --- ---- - --- -
Balance at beginning of year $ 164 $ 161 $ 67
Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 3 — 3
Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 4 31 103
Increase for business acquisition — — —
Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years (10 ) (4 ) (10 )
Settlements (31 ) (21 ) (2 )
Decreases from lapse of statute of limitations — — —
Changes due to currency translation (1 ) (3 ) —
Balance at end of year $ 129 $ 164 $ 161

Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions include $127 million at May 31, 2020 and $141 million at May 31, 2019 associated with positions that, if favorably resolved, would provide a benefit to our income tax expense. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $41 million on May 31, 2020 and $38 million on May 31, 2019. Total interest and penalties included in our consolidated statements of income are immaterial.

It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals or litigation in state, local, federal and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our liability for uncertain tax positions includes no matters that are individually or collectively material to us. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months, but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible changes cannot be made. However, we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax positions will have a material effect on us.

NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS

We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans.

The accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the PBO of the plan.

A summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019 2018
-------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - ----- ---- - --- -
Defined benefit pension plans $ 148 $ 111 $ 150

 $ 1,601 $ 4,629 $ 741

The components of the MTM adjustments are as follows (in millions):

 2020 2019 2018
--------------------------------------- ---- ------ - ---- - ----- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate change $ 2,997 $ 1,780 $ (613 )

Annuity contract purchase — — 210
Total MTM loss (gain) $ 794 $ 3,882 $ (10 )

2020

The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans decreased from 3.69% at May 31, 2019 to 3.05% at May 31, 2020. The demographic experience in 2020 reflects an update to our mortality assumption and a current-year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions. The actual rate of return, which is net of all fees and expenses, on our U.S. Pension Plan assets of 15.00% was higher than our expected return of 6.75%, as return seeking assets, primarily equities, were positive despite equity market volatility. Additionally, fixed income assets performed as expected as interest rates declined.

2019

The weighted-average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans decreased from 4.11% at May 31, 2018 to 3.69% at May 31, 2019. The demographic experience in 2019 reflects updates to several forward-looking assumptions, including retirement rates, disability incidence rates and salary increase assumptions, and a current-year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions. The actual rate of return, which is net of all fees and expenses, on our U.S. Pension Plan assets of 4.05% was lower than our expected return of 6.75%, as lower than expected equity returns negatively impacted return-seeking assets while fixed-income assets performed as expected due to declining interest rates.

2018

The weighted-average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 3.98% at May 31, 2017 to 4.11% at May 31, 2018. The demographic experience in 2018 reflects a liability loss due to unfavorable results related to various demographic assumptions. The annuity contract purchase loss relates to the contract with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as discussed below. The actual rate of return, which is net of all fees and expenses, on our U.S. Pension Plan assets of 6.30% was slightly lower than our expected return of 6.50% primarily due to generally flat returns in the long-duration fixed-income portfolio partially offset by strong returns from global equities.

PENSION PLANS. Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account (“PPA”). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.

We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

In May 2018, we entered into an agreement with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately $6 billion of our U.S. Pension Plan obligations. The transaction transferred responsibility for pension benefits to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for approximately 41,000 of our retirees and beneficiaries who satisfied certain conditions and were receiving a monthly benefit from participating U.S. Pension Plans. There was no change to the pension benefits for any plan participants as a result of this transaction. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by assets of the U.S. Pension Plans. We recognized a $210 million one-time settlement loss in connection with this transaction, which was included in our 2018 year-end MTM retirement plans accounting adjustment.
In November 2019, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We will introduce an all-401(k)-plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies. During 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula will be given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure become effective beginning January 1, 2022. While this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our long-term pension costs, it will not have a material impact on current or near-term financial results.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988. Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has been reached under most plans, so these benefits are not subject to future inflation.

Effective January 1, 2018, certain of our U.S. postretirement healthcare benefits were converted to a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health reimbursement account (HRA) for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at January 1, 2018 or upon age at retirement thereafter. In connection with this change, retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.

PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.

Weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our plans are as follows:

 U.S. Pension Plans International Pension Plans Postretirement Healthcare Plans

Our U.S. Pension Plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we follow a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities.

Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter, which we review on an annual basis and revise as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:

 • the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;

 • the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time, net of all fees and expenses; and

 • the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds.

For consolidated pension expense, we assumed a 6.75% expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets in 2020 and 2019, and 6.50% in 2018. For the 15-year period ended May 31, 2020, our actual return was 7.70%, net of all fees and expenses.

The investment strategy for our U.S. Pension Plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of public equities and fixed-income and alternative investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our largest asset classes are Corporate Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed Income Securities (which are largely benchmarked against the Barclays Long Government, Barclays Long Corporate or the Citigroup 20+ STRIPS indices), and U.S. and non-U.S. Equities (which are mainly benchmarked to the S&P 500 Index and MSCI indices). Accordingly, we do not have any significant concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns and manage portfolio risk.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value:

 • Cash and cash equivalents. Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments include short-term investment funds which are collective funds priced at a constant value by the administrator of the funds.

 • Domestic, international and global equities. Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.

 • Fixed income. We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities and other fixed income securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

 • Alternative Investments. The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables and performance multiples.

The fair values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations for our U.S. Pension Plans and our most significant international pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table (in millions):

These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these estimates.

Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 5.70% during 2021, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 4.50% in 2037 and thereafter.

A summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

 In November 2019, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We will introduce an all-401(k)-plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies. During 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula will be given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure become effective beginning January 1, 2022. While this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our long-term pension costs, it will not have a material impact on current or near-term financial results.

NOTE 14: BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND DISAGGREGATED REVENUE

FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, constitute our reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses:

FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation)
---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TNT Express (international express transportation, small-package ground delivery and freight transportation) FedEx Custom Critical Inc. (“FedEx Custom Critical”) (time-critical transportation)

FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)

FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)

FedEx Services Segment FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services and back-office functions)

Effective June 1, 2019, the results of the FedEx Office operating segment are included in “Corporate, other and eliminations.” This change was made to reflect our internal management reporting structure. Prior year amounts have been revised to reflect current year presentation.

Effective March 1, 2020, the results of FedEx Custom Critical are included in the FedEx Express segment prospectively as the impact to prior periods was not material. This change was made to reflect our internal management reporting structure.

FedEx Services Segment

The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information-technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and allow us to obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in their natural expense line items. The FedEx Services segment includes FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services for U.S. customers of our major business units and certain back-office support to our other companies.

The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.

Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations also include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.

(4) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $840.0 million, $780.1 million, and $694.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 32 ------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------- Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2020 Earnings per share - diluted $5.15 to $5.25 Impact of special charges 0.05 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $5.20 to $5.30 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...

(7) Lennar Other Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation. The Company's reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina Central: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia Texas: Texas West: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington Other: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments primarily in California, including Five Point Holdings, LLC ("FivePoint") Operations of the Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title and closing services primarily for buyers of the Company's homes.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...
