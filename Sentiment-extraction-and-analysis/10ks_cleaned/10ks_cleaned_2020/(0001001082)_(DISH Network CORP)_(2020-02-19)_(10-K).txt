Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
​
You should read the following management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management’s discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
​
Overview
​
Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We promote our Pay-TV services as providing our subscribers with a better “price-to-value” relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. In connection with the growth in OTT industry, we promote our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services.
​
As the pay-TV industry is mature, our DISH TV strategy has included an emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers, including subscribers in markets underserved by pay-TV services, even if it means that we will acquire and retain fewer overall subscribers. We evaluate the quality of subscribers based upon a number of factors, including, among others, profitability. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, this strategy. There can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate.
​
Our revenue and profit is primarily derived from Pay-TV programming services that we provide to our subscribers. We also generate revenue from equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including DVRs and fees from subscribers with multiple receivers; advertising services; fees earned from our Smart Home service operations; broadband services; warranty services; and sales of digital receivers and related equipment to third-party pay-TV providers. Our subscriber-related revenue has been declining due to, among other things, the continuing decline in our DISH TV subscriber base. Our most significant expenses are subscriber-related expenses, which are primarily related to programming.

​
Business Segments
​
We currently operate two primary business segments: (1) Pay-TV; and (2) Wireless.
​
Pay-TV
​
We are the nation’s fourth largest pay-TV provider and offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand, and the Sling brand. As of December 31, 2019, we had 11.986 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 9.394 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.592 million Sling TV subscribers.
​
Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. To differentiate our DISH TV services from our competitors, we offer the Hopper whole-home DVR and have continued to add functionality and simplicity for a more intuitive user experience. Our Hopper and Joey® whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere. It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, streaming media devices, tablets, phones and computers. The Hopper 3, among other things, features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously.
​
We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services. Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones. We offer Sling International, Sling Latino and Sling domestic video programming services. Our domestic Sling TV services have a single-stream service branded Sling Orange and a multi-stream service branded Sling Blue, which includes, among other things, the ability to stream on up to three devices simultaneously.

Table of Contents

We face competition from providers of video content distributed over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These providers include, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Disney, Verizon, AT&T, ViacomCBS, STARZ, Fubo and Philo.  Many of these companies have larger customer bases, stronger brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, traditional providers of video entertainment, including broadcasters, cable channels and MVPDs, are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Some of these services charge nominal or no fees for access to their content, which could adversely affect demand for our Pay-TV services.
​
Moreover, new technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face with respect to video services, including competition from piracy-based video offerings.
​
This competition, among other things, has caused the rate of growth in subscribers to our Sling TV services to decrease. In June 2018, we launched additional Sling TV services which include offering consumers a la carte channel subscriptions, access to pay-per-view events and movies, and access to free content. There can be no assurance that these additional services or other offers will positively affect our results of operations or our net Sling TV subscribers.
​
In addition, we historically offered broadband services under the dishNET™ brand, which includes satellite broadband services that utilize advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes Communications, Inc. (“Hughes”) and ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”) and wireline broadband services.  However, as of the first quarter 2018, we have transitioned our broadband business focus from wholesale to authorized representative arrangements, and we are no longer marketing dishNET broadband services. Our existing broadband subscribers are declining through customer attrition.  Generally, under these authorized representative arrangements, we will receive certain payments for each broadband service activation generated and installation performed, and we will not incur subscriber acquisition costs for these activations.
​
Recent Developments
​
Master Transaction Agreement
​
On May 19, 2019, we and Merger Sub entered into the Master Transaction Agreement with EchoStar and Newco. Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, among other things: (i) EchoStar carried out an internal reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities of the EchoStar Satellite Services segment, the BSS Business, were transferred to Newco; (ii) EchoStar distributed all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Newco, to the holders of record of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of EchoStar and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of EchoStar; and (iii) upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub ceased to exist and Newco continued as our wholly-owned subsidiary.
​
Effective September 10, 2019, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement, in consideration for the Merger, we issued 22,937,188 shares of our Class A common stock to the holders of Newco Common Stock at a ratio of 0.23523769 of our Class A common stock for each outstanding share of Newco Common Stock. The transaction was structured as a tax-free spin-off and merger.
​

​

Table of Contents

In addition, as the result of the Merger, we, EchoStar and, as relevant, certain of our or their respective subsidiaries, entered into ancillary agreements involving tax, employment and intellectual property matters, which set forth certain rights and obligations of us and EchoStar and our and their respective subsidiaries related to the Merger with respect to, among other things: (i) the payment of tax liability refunds, and the filing of tax returns related to Newco and the BSS Business; (ii) the allocation of employment-related assets and liabilities between us and EchoStar; (iii) certain employee compensation, equity awards, benefit plans, programs and arrangements relating to employees who are expected to be transferred to us pursuant to the Merger; (iv) a cross-license between us and EchoStar for certain intellectual property either transferred to us as part of the Merger or retained by EchoStar that is also used in the BSS Business; and (v) the provision of certain telemetry, tracking and control services by us and our subsidiaries to EchoStar and its subsidiaries.
​
The description of the Master Transaction Agreement in this section is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Master Transaction Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.
​
The Merger was accounted for as an asset purchase, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. As the Merger was between entities that were under common control, we recorded the assets and liabilities received under the Merger at EchoStar’s historical cost basis, with the offsetting amount recorded in “Additional paid-in capital” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A substantial portion of the assets received under the Merger were historically leased to us by EchoStar. As these assets and the related liabilities have been transferred to us pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, they will no longer be included in “Operating lease assets,” “Other current liabilities” and “Operating lease liabilities,” but rather in “Property and equipment, net” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
​
See Note 1 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
​
Sprint Asset Acquisition
​
Asset Purchase Agreement
​
On July 26, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with T-Mobile US, Inc. (“TMUS”) and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint” and together with TMUS, the “Sellers” and after the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger, sometimes referred to as “NTM”).
​
Pursuant to the APA, after the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger and at the closing of the transaction, NTM will sell to us and we will acquire from NTM certain assets and liabilities associated with the Prepaid Business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion. Under the Proposed Final Judgment (as defined below), TMUS is required to divest the Prepaid Business to us no later than the latest of (i) 15 days after TMUS has enabled us to provision any new or existing customers of the Prepaid Business holding a compatible handset device onto the NTM network, (ii) the first business day of the month following the later of the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger or the receipt of approvals for the Prepaid Business Sale, and (iii) five days after the entry of the Final Judgment (as defined below) by the District Court (as defined below). We expect to fund the purchase price with cash on hand or other available sources of liquidity.
​
At the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we and NTM will enter into the TSA, the MNSA, the Option Agreement, and the Spectrum Purchase Agreement for an additional approximately $3.59 billion. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Sprint Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transaction Agreements.

​
Agreement with the DOJ: The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment
​
In connection with the Prepaid Business Sale and the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger, we, TMUS, Sprint, DT and SoftBank agreed with the DOJ on certain key terms relating to the Transaction Agreements and our wireless service business and spectrum. On July 26, 2019, Defendants entered into the Stipulation and Order with the DOJ binding the Defendants to the Proposed Final Judgment which memorialized the agreement between the DOJ and the Defendants. The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment were filed in the District Court on July 26, 2019. Certain of the provisions of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment are also reflected in the terms of the Transaction Agreements.
​
In addition to the terms reflected in the Transaction Agreements, the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment provide for other rights and obligations of the Sellers and us, including the following:

 ● For a period of one year after the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, if we determine that certain assets not included in the divestiture were previously used by the Prepaid Business and are reasonably necessary for the continued competitiveness of the Prepaid Business, subject to certain carve-outs, we may request that such assets be transferred to us, which the DOJ can approve or deny in its sole discretion.

 ● Within one year of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we will be required to offer nationwide postpaid retail mobile wireless service.

 ● NTM must take all actions required to enable us to provision any new or existing customer with a compatible handset onto the NTM network within 90 days of the entry of the Final Judgment.

 ● If we elect not to purchase the 800 MHz licenses pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, we must pay $360 million (equal to 10% of the Spectrum Purchase Agreement purchase price) to the United States. However, we will not be required to make such payment if we have deployed a core network and offered 5G service to at least 20% of the U.S. population within three years of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale.

 ● If we buy the 800 MHz spectrum pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement but fail to deploy all of the 800 MHz spectrum licenses for use in the provision of retail mobile wireless services by the expiration of the Final Judgment (as described below), the DOJ may require us to forfeit to the FCC any of the 800 MHz licenses for spectrum that are not being used to provide retail mobile wireless services, unless we are already providing nationwide retail wireless service.

 ● We and NTM must negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement for NTM to lease some or all of our 600 MHz spectrum licenses for deployment to retail consumers by NTM. We and NTM must report on the status of the negotiations within 90 days after the filing of the Final Judgment. If no agreement has been reached by 180 days following the filing of the Final Judgement, the DOJ may resolve any dispute in its sole discretion, provided that such resolution must be on commercially reasonable terms to both parties.

 ● We and NTM must agree to support eSIM technology on smartphones.

 ● The Sellers must introduce the suppliers and distributors of the Prepaid Business to us and the Sellers may not interfere in our negotiations with such suppliers and distributors.

 ● On the first day of the fiscal quarter following the entry of the Final Judgment and of each 180-day period thereafter, we will be obligated to provide the DOJ with a description of our deployment efforts over the prior quarter including: (i) the number of towers and small cells deployed, (ii) the spectrum bands on which we have deployed equipment, (iii) progress in obtaining devices that operate on our spectrum frequencies, (iv) POPs coverage of our network, (v) the number of our mobile wireless subscriptions, (vi) the amount of traffic transmitted to our subscribers using our network and using NTM’s network, and (vii) whether there are or have been any efforts by NTM to interfere with our efforts to deploy and operate our network.

 ● We cannot sell, lease or otherwise provide the right to use any of the divested assets to any national facilities-based mobile wireless provider and may not sell any of the divested assets or similar assets back to TMUS during the term of the Final Judgment (as described below), except that we may lease back to NTM up to 4 MHz of the 800 MHz spectrum we will acquire (as discussed above).

 ● We must comply with the 2023 AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block, and nationwide 5G broadband network build-out commitments made to the FCC, subject to verification by the FCC (as described below). If we fail to comply with such build-out commitments, we could face civil contempt in addition to the substantial voluntary contributions and license forfeitures described below if we fail to meet the June 14, 2023 commitments (as described below).

​
Upon the signing of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment by the District Court, the Sellers will be permitted by the DOJ to consummate the Sprint-TMUS merger (subject to any additional closing conditions related thereto). The Proposed Final Judgment is subject to the procedures of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, pursuant to which, following a 60-day public comment period and other related procedures, the Proposed Final Judgment will be entered with the District Court (the Proposed Final Judgment as so entered with the District Court, the “Final Judgment”). The term of the Final Judgment will be seven years from the date of its entry with the District Court or five years if the DOJ gives notice that the divestitures, build-outs and other requirements have been completed to its satisfaction. A monitoring trustee has been appointed by the District Court that has the power and authority to monitor the Defendants’ compliance with the Final Judgment and settle disputes among the Defendants regarding compliance with the provisions of the Final Judgment and may recommend action to the DOJ in the event a party fails to comply with the Final Judgment.
​
FCC Build-Out Commitments
​
In a letter filed with the FCC on July 26, 2019, we voluntarily committed to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network and meet revised timelines relating to the build-out of our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block and 600 MHz spectrum assets, subject to certain penalties. Pursuant to these commitments, we requested multi-year extensions to deploy our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum, and we have committed to build out our 600 MHz licenses on an accelerated schedule to better align with our 5G deployment. We have also committed to offer 5G broadband service to certain population coverage targets, along with minimum core network, tower and spectrum use targets, and have waived our right to deploy any technology of our choice under the FCC’s “flexible use” rules with respect to these spectrum bands. Failure to meet the various commitments would require us to pay voluntary contributions totaling up to $2.2 billion to the FCC and would subject certain licenses in the AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum to forfeiture. We have also agreed not to sell our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years without prior DOJ and FCC approval (unless such sale is part of a change of control of DISH Network). Additionally, we have agreed not to lease a certain percentage of network capacity on our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years to the three largest U.S. wireless carriers (i.e., AT&T, Verizon and NTM), without prior FCC approval. On November 5, 2019, the FCC released an Order that, among other things, approved the Sprint-TMUS merger, tolled our existing March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for our AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block Licenses, and directed the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to adopt our commitments after a 30 day review period (the “FCC Merger Order”).

Table of Contents

Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands is tolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadline will be reinstated with extensions equal to the length of time the deadline was tolled. Except for the tolling of the March 2020 deadline, we may not receive the requested buildout extensions unless and until the Prepaid Business Sale closes.
​
Our 5G deployment commitments for each of the four spectrum bands are generally as follows:

 ● With respect to the 600 MHz licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2023, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 75% of the population in each Partial Economic Area (which are service areas established by the FCC) no later than June 14, 2025. Note that these commitments are earlier than the current 600 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement date of June 2029. See Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

 ● With respect to the AWS-4 licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.

 ● With respect to the Lower 700 MHz E Block licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses no later than June 14, 2023.

 ● With respect to the AWS H Block licenses, we committed to offer later than June 14, 2023.

​
On June 11, 2019, a number of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against TMUS, DT, Sprint, and SoftBank in the Southern District, alleging that the Sprint-TMUS merger, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and therefore should be enjoined. On February 11, 2020, the Southern District ruled in favor of the Sprint-TMUS merger. If this decision is appealed by any state attorneys general, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any such appeals process.
​
Wireless
​
Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands is tolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadlines (as discussed in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) would be reinstated with extensions equal to the length of time the deadline was tolled. During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband IoT deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled. We have issued RFI/Ps to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our 5G Network Deployment.

Since 2008, we have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of over $21 billion, as described further below. The $21 billion of investments related to wireless spectrum licenses described below does not include $5 billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses.  See Note 2 “Capitalized Interest” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on capitalized interest.
​
DISH Network Spectrum
​
We have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. In March 2017, we notified the FCC that we planned to deploy a narrowband IoT network on certain of these wireless licenses, which was to be the First Phase. We expected to complete the First Phase by March 2020, with subsequent phases to be completed thereafter. We have entered into vendor contracts with multiple parties for, among other things, base stations, chipsets, modules, tower leases, the core network, RF design, and deployment services for the First Phase.  Among other things, initial RF design in connection with the First Phase was complete, we had secured certain tower sites, and we were in the process of identifying and securing additional tower sites.  The core network had been installed and commissioned.  We installed the first base stations on sites in 2018 and were in the process of deploying the remaining base stations.  During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband IoT deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled as discussed above.  In addition, we have issued RFI/Ps to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our 5G Network Deployment.  We currently expect expenditures for our wireless projects to be between $250 million and $500 million during 2020, excluding capitalized interest.  We currently expect expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to be approximately $10 billion, excluding capitalized interest.   We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses.
​
Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we will incur significant additional expenses and will have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. See Note 2 “Capitalized Interest” and Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses
​
During 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. (“American II”) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. (“American III”), we initially made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, LLC (“Northstar Spectrum”), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, L.L.C. (“Northstar Wireless,” and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the “Northstar Entities”), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC (“SNR HoldCo”), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC (“SNR Wireless,” and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the “SNR Entities”), respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the “AWS-3 Licenses”) to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in “FCC authorizations” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​

​
​

Table of Contents

The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. The Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may be obtained from third party sources or from us, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any loans, equity contributions or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Business Developments
​
Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described in our public filings. In October 2016, AT&T announced its acquisition of Time Warner, which was completed in June 2018. In December 2017, Walt Disney Company announced its acquisition of certain assets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., which was completed in March 2019.  These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. For example, in connection with AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, Turner sent all of its distributors written, irrevocable offers to submit disputes over the price and other terms of Turner programming to binding arbitration and to guarantee continued access to that programming while any arbitration is pending. However, in October 2018, AT&T removed its HBO and Cinemax channels, which are not part of Turner, from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup, as we and AT&T have been unable to negotiate the terms and conditions of a new programming carriage contract.
​
Trends in our Pay-TV Segment
​
Competition
​
Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. With respect to our DISH TV services, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services.
​
We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, mostly as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services.

Table of Contents

​
Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet. Our Sling TV services face increased competition from content providers and other companies, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies, that are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. We also face competition from providers of video content distributed over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These providers include, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Disney, Verizon, AT&T, ViacomCBS, STARZ, Fubo and Philo.  Furthermore, our DISH TV services face increased competition as programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices. Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services (“cord cutting”), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (“cord shaving”) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us.
​
We implement new marketing promotions from time to time that are intended to increase our Pay-TV subscriber activations. For our DISH TV services, we have launched various marketing promotions offering certain DISH TV programming packages without a price increase for a commitment period. We also launched our Flex Pack skinny bundle with a core package of programming consisting of more than 50 channels and the choice of one of ten themed add-on channel packs, which include, among others, local broadcast networks and kids and general entertainment programming. Subscribers can also add or remove additional channel packs to best suit their entertainment needs. In addition, certain streaming apps, including, among others, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube, have been integrated into select Hopper receiver systems. During 2017, we launched “Tuned In To You” and during 2019 we launched the “Tuned In To You 2.0” campaign, which further amplifies our commitment to customer satisfaction.  While we plan to implement these and other new marketing efforts for our DISH TV services, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.
​
Additionally, in response to our efforts, we may face increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing and retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers.
​
For our Sling TV services, we offer a personalized TV experience with a customized channel line-up and two of the lowest priced multichannel live-linear online streaming services in the industry, our Sling Orange service and our Sling Blue service. During 2018, we launched our “We are Slingers” campaign and during 2019, we launched our “Sling In” campaign. While we plan to implement this and other new marketing efforts for our Sling TV services, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our net Sling TV subscriber activations.
​
Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Programming
​
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our “Subscriber-related expenses” and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers.
​
Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay-per-view movies, resulting in less revenue to us.
​
Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts before they expire. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. For example, in June 2018 and November 2018, Univision Communications Inc. (“Univision”) removed certain of its channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup. On March 26, 2019, we and Univision signed a new programming carriage contract which restored certain of these Univision channels to our DISH TV programming lineup. In October 2018, AT&T removed its HBO and Cinemax channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup, as we and AT&T have been unable to negotiate the terms and conditions of a new programming carriage contract. AT&T offers its programming, including its HBO and Cinemax channels, directly to consumers over the Internet and provides HBO for free to its subscribers under certain offers. In July 2019, Fox Regional Sports Networks (“RSNs”) also removed certain of its channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup. In August 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the Fox RSNs. We experienced a higher DISH TV churn rate, higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations during 2018 and 2019, when Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs removed certain of their channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup. There can be no assurance that channel removals, such as the removal of the channels discussed above or others, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.
​
We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from additional programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses.
​
Operations and Customer Service
​
While competitive factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to us. In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by our operational inefficiencies. For our DISH TV services, in order to combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called “smart cards,” or security chips in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (“Security Access Devices”). We expect that future replacements of these devices may be necessary to keep our system secure. To combat other forms of fraud, among other things, we monitor our independent third-party distributors’ and independent third-party retailers’ adherence to our business rules. Furthermore, for our Sling TV services, we encrypt programming content and use digital rights management software to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to our programming content.

Table of Contents

​
While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot be certain, however, that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance.
​
Changes in our Technology
​
We have been deploying DBS receivers for our DISH TV services that utilize 8PSK modulation technology with MPEG-4 compression technology for several years. These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow improved broadcast efficiency, and therefore allow increased programming capacity. Many of our customers today, however, do not have DBS receivers that use MPEG-4 compression technology. In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our retention costs. All new DBS receivers have MPEG-4 compression with 8PSK modulation technology.
​
In addition, from time to time, we change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives. We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes.
​
EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS
​
Subscriber-related revenue. “Subscriber-related revenue” consists principally of revenue from basic, local, premium movie, pay-per-view, Latino and international subscriptions; equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including DVRs and fees from subscribers with multiple receivers; advertising services; fees earned from our in-home service operations; broadband services; warranty services; and other subscriber revenue. Certain of the amounts included in “Subscriber-related revenue” are not recurring on a monthly basis.
​
Equipment sales and other revenue. “Equipment sales and other revenue” principally includes the non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, sales of digital receivers and related components to third-party pay-TV providers, revenue from OnTech Smart Services and revenue from services and other agreements with EchoStar.
​
Subscriber-related expenses. “Subscriber-related expenses” principally include programming expenses, which represent a substantial majority of these expenses. “Subscriber-related expenses” also include costs for Pay-TV and broadband services incurred in connection with our subscriber retention, in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to DBS receiver systems, other variable subscriber expenses and monthly wholesale fees paid to broadband providers.
​
Satellite and transmission expenses. “Satellite and transmission expenses” includes the cost of digital broadcast operations, the cost of leasing satellite capacity, executory costs associated with finance leases, the cost of telemetry, tracking and control, and other related services. In addition, “Satellite and transmission expenses” includes costs associated with our Sling TV services including, among other things, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure.
​
Cost of sales - equipment and other. “Cost of sales - equipment and other” primarily includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, costs associated with sales of digital receivers and related components to third-party pay-TV providers, costs associated with OnTech Smart Services and costs related to services and other agreements with EchoStar.

Subscriber acquisition costs. While we primarily lease DBS receiver systems, we also subsidize certain costs to attract new subscribers. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” include the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” also includes costs associated with acquiring Sling TV subscribers including, among other things, costs related to acquisition advertising and our direct sales efforts and commissions.  Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, we capitalize payments made under certain sales incentive programs, including those with our independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors, which were previously expensed as “Subscriber acquisition costs.”  These amounts are now initially capitalized in “Other current assets” and “Other noncurrent assets, net” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and then amortized in “Other subscriber acquisition costs” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry.  We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the “average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation,” or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses.  Our DISH TV SAC is calculated as “Subscriber acquisition costs,” excluding “Subscriber acquisition costs” associated with our Sling TV services, plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs, excluding amortization related to these payments, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers, divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We include all the costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as we believe it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers.  We also include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.
​
General and administrative expenses. “General and administrative expenses” consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, and accounting and finance. It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration.
​
Litigation expense. “Litigation expense” primarily consists of certain significant legal settlements, judgments and/or accruals.
​
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” primarily includes interest expense (net of capitalized interest), prepayment premiums, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, and interest expense associated with our finance lease obligations. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our capitalized interest policy.
​
Other, net. The main components of “Other, net” are gains and losses realized on the sale and/or conversion of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of certain marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates.
​
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). EBITDA is defined as “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network” plus “Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized” net of “Interest income,” “Income tax (provision) benefit, net” and “Depreciation and amortization.” This “non-GAAP measure” is reconciled to “Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network” in our discussion of “Results of Operations” below.

DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by $34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count.
​
Sling TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our Sling TV subscriber count. Sling TV subscribers are recorded net of disconnects. Sling TV customers receiving service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our Sling TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple Sling TV packages, including, among others, Sling TV Blue, Sling TV Orange, Sling Latino and Sling International, each customer is only counted as one Sling TV subscriber.
​
Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and Sling TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our Sling TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber.
​
Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (“Pay-TV ARPU”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly “Subscriber-related revenue,” excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.
​
DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate (“DISH TV churn rate”). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two.
​
Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Pay-TV subscribers. We lost approximately 336,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the loss of approximately 920,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2018. The decrease in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from fewer net DISH TV subscriber losses, partially offset by fewer net Sling TV subscriber additions. Our net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were negatively impacted by Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs’ removal of certain of their channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup. On March 26, 2019, we and Univision signed a new programming carriage contract which restored certain Univision channels to our DISH TV programming lineup.  In August 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the Fox RSNs. We lost approximately 511,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the loss of approximately 1.125 million net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2018. This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate and higher gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We added approximately 175,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the addition of approximately 205,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the same period in 2018. This decrease in net Sling TV subscriber additions is primarily related to increased competition, including competition from other OTT service providers, and to a higher number of customer disconnects on a larger Sling TV subscriber base, including the impact from Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs’ removal of certain of their channels from our programming lineup, discussed above.
​
Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 1.62% compared to 1.78% for the same period in 2018. This decrease primarily resulted from our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was negatively impacted by various channel removals from our programming lineup. For example, our DISH TV churn rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was negatively impacted by Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs’ removal of certain of their channels from our programming lineup. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we activated approximately 1.348 million gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 1.114 million gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2018, an increase of 21.0%. The increase in gross new DISH TV subscribers resulted from the effectiveness of our promotions and product offers. Although our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations increased, our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, and by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers; and channel removals.
​
During September 2017, Hurricane Maria caused extraordinary damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, resulting in a widespread loss of power and infrastructure. Given the devastation and loss of power, substantially all customers in those areas were unable to receive our service as of September 30, 2017. In an effort to ensure customers would not be charged for services they were unable to receive, we proactively paused service for those customers. Accordingly, we removed approximately 145,000 subscribers, representing all of our subscribers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, from our ending Pay-TV subscriber count as of September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter 2017, 75,000 of these customers reactivated.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, 31,000 of these customers reactivated. We incurred certain costs in connection with the re-activation of these returning subscribers, and accordingly, these returning customers were recorded as gross new DISH TV subscriber activations with the corresponding costs recorded in “Subscriber acquisition costs” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and/or in “Purchases of property and equipment” on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses.
​
We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue.
​
Subscriber-related revenue. “Subscriber-related revenue” totaled $12.616 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $840 million or 6.2% compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in “Subscriber-related revenue” compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily related to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below. We expect these trends in “Subscriber-related revenue” to continue.
​
Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $85.92 during the year ended December 31, 2019 versus $85.46 during the same period in 2018. The $0.46 or 0.5% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV programming package price increases in the first quarter 2019 and 2018 and Sling TV programming package price increases in the third quarter 2018. The increases were partially offset by an increase in Sling TV subscribers as a percentage of our total Pay-TV subscriber base and a decrease in revenue related to premium channels. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, the increase in Sling TV subscribers had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU.  We expect this trend to continue.
​
Subscriber-related expenses. “Subscriber-related expenses” totaled $7.870 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $675 million or 7.9% compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in “Subscriber-related expenses” was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and lower programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber during the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased due to AT&T and Fox RSN’s removal of certain of their channels from our programming lineup. This decrease was partially offset by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. “Subscriber-related expenses” represented 62.4% and 63.5% of “Subscriber-related revenue” during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
​
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our “Subscriber-related expenses” have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base.
​
Satellite and transmission expenses. “Satellite and transmission expenses” totaled $448 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $129 million or 22.3% compared to the same period in 2018. This decrease primarily resulted from the reduction of expense associated with the transfer of certain assets to us pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement. See Note 1 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Subscriber acquisition costs. “Subscriber acquisition costs” totaled $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $225 million or 29.3% compared to the same period in 2018. This change was primarily attributable to higher gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and the increase in DISH TV SAC, discussed below.

DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was $822 during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $759 during the same period in 2018, an increase of $63 or 8.3%. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in hardware, advertising and installation costs per activation.  The increase in hardware and installation costs resulted from our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers who activate with higher priced receivers, such as the Hopper 3, and a lower percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2018 were positively impacted by the reactivation of certain subscribers in Puerto Rico related to Hurricane Maria. The expenses we incurred for these reactivations were lower on a per subscriber basis than those incurred for the remaining gross new DISH TV subscriber activations during the year ended December 31, 2019.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled $191 million and $120 million, respectively. This increase in capital expenditures resulted from higher gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, discussed above, and our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers who activate with higher priced receivers, such as the Hopper 3, and a lower percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts.
​
To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment.
​
Our “Subscriber acquisition costs” and “DISH TV SAC” may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies. See further information under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs.”
​
General and administrative expenses. “General and administrative expenses” totaled $793 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, a $68 million or 9.4% increase compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in legal fees and an increase in expense related to supporting our wireless projects. The year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by the reimbursement of legal fees during 2018.
​
Depreciation and amortization. “Depreciation and amortization” expense totaled $631 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, an $81 million or 11.4% decrease compared to the same period in 2018. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense associated with the transfer of certain assets to us pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement.
​
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.428 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $363 million or 13.0% compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating income discussed above, excluding the change in “Depreciation and amortization.”  The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements.

EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
​
Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was $451 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $82 million compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease in the provision was primarily related to a decrease in “Income (loss) before income taxes.”

​
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
​
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities
​
We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $2.860 billion compared to $2.069 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $791 million. This increase in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities primarily resulted from cash generated from operating activities of $2.662 billion and net proceeds related to the stock rights offering of $998 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.482 billion (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) and the redemption and repurchases of our 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2019 with an aggregate principal balance of $1.317 billion.
​
Debt Maturity
​
Our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million were redeemed on July 17, 2017.
​
During 2017 and 2018, we repurchased $174 million and $57 million, respectively, of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 in open market trades. The remaining balance of $969 million were redeemed on April 2, 2018.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we repurchased $83 million and $22 million, respectively, of our 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2019 in open market trades. The remaining balance of $1.295 billion was redeemed on September 3, 2019.
​
Our 5 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.1 billion mature on May 1, 2020. We will either fund this obligation from cash and marketable investment securities balances at that time or, depending on market conditions, we may refinance this obligation in whole or in part.
​
Stock Rights Offering
​
During November 2019, we launched a rights offering pursuant to which we distributed transferable subscription rights pro rata to holders of record of our Class A and B common stock, and outstanding convertible notes (based on the applicable conversion ratio for those notes as of the record date) on November 17, 2019.  The subscription rights entitled the holder to acquire newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock at a subscription price of $33.52 per share.
​

Upon completion of the rights offering on December 13, 2019, we raised approximately $1 billion and issued 29,834,992 shares of DISH’s Class A common stock.
​
Cash Flow
​
The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
​
Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base, expand our infrastructure, make strategic investments, such as significant investments in wireless, including commercialization of our wireless spectrum, and repay debt obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reported “Net cash flows from operating activities” of $2.662 billion, $2.518 billion and $2.780 billion, respectively.
​
Net cash flows from operating activities from 2018 to 2019 increased $144 million, primarily attributable to an increase in cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including taxes. This increase was partially offset by a $463 million decrease in income adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments,” “Depreciation and amortization” expense, and “Deferred tax expense (benefit).”
​
Net cash flows from operating activities from 2017 to 2018 decreased $262 million, primarily attributable to a decrease in cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including income taxes. This decrease was partially offset by a $267 million increase in income adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for “Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments,” “Depreciation and amortization” expense, “Impairment of long-lived assets” and “Deferred tax expense (benefit).”
​
Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, acquisitions, strategic investments, including purchases and settlements of derivative financial instruments, and purchases of wireless spectrum licenses, capital expenditures and capitalized interest. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reported outflows from “Net cash flows from investing activities” of $718 million, $1.975 billion and $6.522 billion, respectively.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, capital expenditures for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment totaled $280 million, $226 million and $259 million, respectively. The increase in 2019 for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment primarily resulted from higher gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.
​
The year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to capital expenditures of $1.482 billion (including $901 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) and cash inflows related to $770 million in net sales of marketable investment securities.
​
The year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to capital expenditures of $1.317 billion (including $923 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) and $674 million in net purchases of marketable investment securities.
​
The year ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to a $4.711 billion payment to the FCC for the 600 MHz Licenses, capital expenditures of $1.385 billion (including $953 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) and $360 million in net purchases of marketable investment securities.
​
Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of equity and long-term and convertible debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, and repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reported outflows from “Net cash flows from financing activities” of $328 million, $1.135 billion and $103 million, respectively.
​

​

Table of Contents

The net cash outflows in 2019 primarily related to the redemption and repurchases of our 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2019 with an aggregate principal balance of $1.317 billion, partially offset by net proceeds related to the stock rights offering of $998 million.
​
The net cash outflows in 2018 primarily related to the redemption and repurchases of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 with an aggregate principal balance of $1.026 billion and $82 million of repurchases of our 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2019 in open market trades.
​
The net cash outflows in 2017 primarily related to the redemption of our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million and the $174 million repurchases of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 in open market trades, partially offset by approximately $994 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024.
​
Free Cash Flow
​
We define free cash flow as “Net cash flows from operating activities” less “Purchases of property and equipment,” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations,” as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments (including strategic wireless investments), fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for “Operating income,” “Net income,” “Net cash flows from operating activities” or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure “Net cash flows from operating activities.”
​
Free cash flow can be significantly impacted from period to period by changes in “Net income (loss)” adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges, operating assets and liabilities, “Purchases of property and equipment,” and “Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations.” These items are shown in the “Net cash flows from operating activities” and “Net cash flows from investing activities” sections on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management’s timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, net Pay-TV subscriber additions (losses), subscriber revenue, DISH TV subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition and retention costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs for DISH TV subscribers, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, expenditures related to the commercialization of our wireless spectrum and other factors.
​
The following table reconciles free cash flow to “Net cash flows from operating activities.”

Operational Liquidity
​
We make general investments in property such as satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our overall Pay-TV business.  We also will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate our wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. Moreover, since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurances that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment.
​
There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our DISH TV churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current Pay-TV subscribers. To the extent we lose Pay-TV subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins. To the extent our “Subscriber-related expenses” grow faster than our “Subscriber-related revenue,” the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. Our subscriber-related margins have been reduced by, among other things, a shift to lower priced Pay-TV programming packages and higher programming costs. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we make general investments (including significant investments in wireless), incur expenditures related to the commercialization of our wireless licenses (including any expenditures associated with the deployment of our wireless networks), incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities. Declines in our Pay-TV subscriber base and subscriber related-margins continue to negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurances that these declines will not continue.
​
Subscriber Base
​
We lost approximately 336,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the loss of approximately 920,000 net by fewer net Sling TV subscriber additions. Our net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were negatively impacted by Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs’ removal of certain of their channels from our DISH TV and Sling TV programming lineup. On March 26, 2019, we and Univision signed a new programming carriage contract which restored certain Univision channels to our DISH TV programming lineup.  In August 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the Fox RSNs. We lost approximately 511,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the loss new DISH TV subscriber activations. We added approximately 175,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the addition of approximately 205,000 net Sling TV subscribers number of customer disconnects on a larger Sling TV subscriber base, including the impact from Univision, AT&T and Fox RSNs’ removal of certain of their channels from our programming lineup. See “Results of Operations” above for further information.

Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs
​
We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, independent third-party retailer incentives, payments made to third-parties, equipment subsidies, installation services, and/or new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. With respect to our DISH TV services, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments to receive service for a minimum term. We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV services over longer periods of time. Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are significantly lower than those for DISH TV subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, mostly as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods to existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.
​
Seasonality
​
Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV industry. In addition, the first and fourth quarters generally produce a lower DISH TV churn rate than the second and third quarters. However, in recent years, as the pay-TV industry has matured, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other’s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. As a result, historical trends in seasonality described above may not be indicative of future trends. Our net Sling TV subscriber additions are impacted by, among other things, certain major sporting events and other major television events. We expect our new Sling TV subscriber additions to potentially demonstrate seasonality patterns as our Sling TV services become more established. We expect to be able to assess the seasonality patterns once we have a longer subscriber history.
​
Satellites
​
Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity.
​

Table of Contents

Security Systems
​
Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors’ signals could, in addition to reducing gross new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. We use Security Access Devices in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Furthermore, for our Sling TV services, we encrypt programming content and use digital rights management software to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to our programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of Security Access Devices may be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system’s security is compromised.
​
Stock Repurchases
​
Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock. On October 28, 2019, our Board of Directors extended this authorization such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion under this program. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no repurchases of our Class A common stock.
​
Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt
​
We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. In particular, the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by DISH DBS Corporation (“DISH DBS”) contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on DISH DBS’ capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS’ capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. In addition, the 3 3/8% Convertible Notes due 2026 (the “Convertible Notes due 2026”) and the 2 3/8% Convertible Notes due 2024 (the “Convertible Notes due 2024,” and collectively with the Convertible Notes due 2026, the “Convertible Notes”) provide that, if a “fundamental change” (as defined in the related indenture) occurs, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we and DISH DBS were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt.
​
Other
​
We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.

 (2) Represents obligations for satellite related executory costs, telemetry, tracking and control (“TT&C”) services and short-term leases.

​
In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent that we procure launch and/or in-orbit insurance on our owned satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites.
​
The table above does not include $674 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits that were accrued, as discussed in Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019. We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months.
​
The table above does not include all potential expenses we expect to incur for our wireless projects including, among other things, our plan to deploy a narrowband IoT network or our 5G Network Deployment. We currently expect expenditures for our wireless projects to be between $250 million and $500 million during 2020, excluding capitalized interest. We currently expect expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to be approximately $10 billion, excluding capitalized interest. See Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
We generally do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.
​
Satellite Insurance
​
We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites we own. We generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.

Our 2020 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for certain fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content, receiver systems and related equipment, broadband equipment, digital broadcast operations, transmission costs, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure, engineering services, and other products and services related to the operation of our Pay-TV services. In addition, our 2020 purchase obligations also include equipment related to the network deployment for our wireless business. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management’s timing of payments and inventory purchases as well as expenditures related to our wireless projects and 5G Network Deployment, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements.
​
Programming Contracts
​
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not included in the “Commitments” table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. In addition, programming costs per subscriber continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms.
​
Future Capital Requirements
​
We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. We will need to make significant additional investments to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate our wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we deploy our 5G network and the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs.
​
Certain of our capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be driven by the rate at which we deploy our 5G network as well as costs associated with subscriber premises equipment. These expenditures are necessary for the deployment of our 5G network as well as to operate and maintain our DISH TV services. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary.
​
Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. In addition, the rulings in the Telemarketing litigation requiring us to pay up to an aggregate amount of $280 million and imposing certain injunctive relief against us, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances and our business operations. In addition, we expect to incur capital expenditures in 2020 related to the commercialization of our existing wireless spectrum licenses, including capital expenditures associated with our wireless projects and 5G Network Deployment, and potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses, discussed below. The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. These factors, including a reduction in our available future cash flows, could require that we raise additional capital in the future.
​
Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position.

Sprint Asset Acquisition
​
Asset Purchase Agreement
​
On July 26, 2019, we entered into the APA with the Sellers, sometimes referred to as NTM.
​
Pursuant to the APA, after the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger and at the closing of the transaction, NTM will sell to us and we will acquire from NTM certain assets and liabilities associated with the Prepaid Business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion. Under the Proposed Final Judgment (as defined below), TMUS is required to divest the Prepaid Business to us no later than the latest of (i) 15 days after TMUS has enabled us to provision any new or existing customers of the Prepaid Business holding a compatible handset device onto the NTM network, (ii) the first business day of the month following the later of the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger or the receipt of approvals for the Prepaid Business Sale, and (iii) five days after the entry of the Final Judgment (as defined below) by the District Court (as defined below). We expect to fund the purchase price with cash on hand or other available sources of liquidity.
​
At the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we and NTM will enter into the TSA, the MNSA, the Option Agreement, and the Spectrum Purchase Agreement for an additional approximately $3.59 billion. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Sprint Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Agreement with the DOJ: The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment
​
In connection with the Prepaid Business Sale and the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger, we, TMUS, Sprint, DT and SoftBank agreed with the DOJ on certain key terms relating to the Transaction Agreements and our wireless service business and spectrum. On July 26, 2019, the “Defendants entered into the Stipulation and Order with the DOJ binding the Defendants to the “Proposed Final Judgment which memorialized the agreement between the DOJ and the Defendants. The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment were filed in the “District Court on July 26, 2019. Certain of the provisions of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment are also reflected in the terms of the Transaction Agreements. In addition to the terms reflected in the Transaction Agreements, the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment provide for other rights and obligations of the Sellers and us, including the following:
​

 ● For a period of one year after the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, if we determine that certain assets not included in the divestiture were previously used by the Prepaid Business and are reasonably necessary for the continued competitiveness of the Prepaid Business, subject to certain carve-outs, we may request that such assets be transferred to us, which the DOJ can approve or deny in its sole discretion.

 ● Within one year of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we will be required to offer nationwide postpaid retail mobile wireless service.

 ● NTM must take all actions required to enable us to provision any new or existing customer with a compatible handset onto the NTM network within 90 days of the entry of the Final Judgment.

 ● If we elect not to purchase the 800 MHz licenses pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, we must pay $360 million (equal to 10% of the Spectrum Purchase Agreement purchase price) to the United States. However, we will not be required to make such payment if we have deployed a core network and offered 5G service to at least 20% of the U.S. population within three years of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale.

​

Table of Contents

 ● If we buy the 800 MHz spectrum pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement but fail to deploy all of the 800 MHz spectrum licenses for use in the provision of retail mobile wireless services by the expiration of the Final Judgment (as described below), the DOJ may require us to forfeit to the FCC any of the 800 MHz licenses for spectrum that are not being used to provide retail mobile wireless services, unless we are already providing nationwide retail wireless service.

 ● We and NTM must negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement for NTM to lease some or all of our 600 MHz spectrum licenses for deployment to retail consumers by NTM. We and NTM must report on the status of the negotiations within 90 days after the filing of the Final Judgment. If no agreement has been reached by 180 days following the filing of the Final Judgement, the DOJ may resolve any dispute in its sole discretion, provided that such resolution must be on commercially reasonable terms to both parties.

 ● We and NTM must agree to support eSIM technology on smartphones.

 ● The Sellers must introduce the suppliers and distributors of the Prepaid Business to us and the Sellers may not interfere in our negotiations with such suppliers and distributors.

 ● On the first day of the fiscal quarter following the entry of the Final Judgment and of each 180-day period thereafter, we will be obligated to provide the DOJ with a description of our deployment efforts over the prior quarter including: (i) the number of towers and small cells deployed, (ii) the spectrum bands on which we have deployed equipment, (iii) progress in obtaining devices that operate on our spectrum frequencies, (iv) POPs coverage of our network, (v) the number of our mobile wireless subscriptions, (vi) the amount of traffic transmitted to our subscribers using our network and using NTM’s network, and (vii) whether there are or have been any efforts by NTM to interfere with our efforts to deploy and operate our network.

 ● We cannot sell, lease or otherwise provide the right to use any of the divested assets to any national facilities-based mobile wireless provider and may not sell any of the divested assets or similar assets back to TMUS during the term of the Final Judgment (as described below), except that we may lease back to NTM up to 4 MHz of the 800 MHz spectrum we will acquire (as discussed above).

 ● We must comply with the 2023 AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block, and nationwide 5G broadband network build-out commitments made to the FCC, subject to verification by the FCC (as described below). If we fail to comply with such build-out commitments, we could face civil contempt in addition to the substantial voluntary contributions and license forfeitures described below if we fail to meet the June 14, 2023 commitments (as described below).

​
Upon the signing of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment by the District Court, the Sellers will be permitted by the DOJ to consummate the Sprint-TMUS merger (subject to any additional closing conditions related thereto). The Proposed Final Judgment is subject to the procedures of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, pursuant to which, following a 60-day public comment period and other related procedures, the Proposed Final Judgment as so entered with the District Court will be the Final Judgment. The term of the Final Judgment will be seven years from the date of its entry with the District Court or five years if the DOJ gives notice that the divestitures, build-outs and other requirements have been completed to its satisfaction. A monitoring trustee has been appointed by the District Court that has the power and authority to monitor the Defendants’ compliance with the Final Judgment and settle disputes among the Defendants regarding compliance with the provisions of the Final Judgment and may recommend action to the DOJ in the event a party fails to comply with the Final Judgment.

FCC Build-Out Commitments
​
In a letter filed with the FCC on July 26, 2019, we voluntarily committed to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network and meet revised timelines relating to the build-out of our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block and 600 MHz spectrum assets, subject to certain penalties. Pursuant to these commitments, we requested multi-year extensions to deploy our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum, and we have committed to build out our 600 MHz licenses on an accelerated schedule to better align with our 5G deployment. We have also committed to offer 5G broadband service to certain population coverage targets, along with minimum core network, tower and spectrum use targets, and have waived our right to deploy any technology of our choice under the FCC’s “flexible use” rules with respect to these spectrum bands. Failure to meet the various commitments would require us to pay voluntary contributions totaling up to $2.2 billion to the FCC and would subject certain licenses in the AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum to forfeiture. We have also agreed not to sell our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years without prior DOJ and FCC approval (unless such sale is part of a change of control of DISH Network). Additionally, we have agreed not to lease a certain percentage of network capacity on our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years to the three largest U.S. wireless carriers (i.e., AT&T, Verizon and NTM), without prior FCC approval. On November 5, 2019, the FCC released the FCC Merger Order.
​
Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands is tolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadline will be reinstated with extensions equal to the length of time the deadline was tolled. Except for the tolling of the March 2020 deadline, we may not receive the requested buildout extensions unless and until the Prepaid Business Sale closes.
​
Our 5G deployment commitments for each of the four spectrum bands are generally as follows:

 ● With respect to the 600 MHz licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2023, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 75% of the population in each Partial Economic Area (which are service areas established by the FCC) no later than June 14, 2025. Note that these commitments are earlier than the current 600 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement date of June 2029. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

 ● With respect to the AWS-4 licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.

 ● With respect to the Lower 700 MHz E Block licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses no later than June 14, 2023.

 ● With respect to the AWS H Block licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.

​
​
On June 11, 2019, a number of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against TMUS, DT, Sprint, and SoftBank in the Southern District, alleging that the Sprint-TMUS merger, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and therefore should be enjoined. On February 11, 2020, the Southern District ruled in favor of the Sprint-TMUS merger. If this decision is appealed by any state attorneys general, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any such appeals process.

Wireless
​
Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands is tolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadlines (as discussed in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) would be reinstated with extensions equal to the length of time the deadline was tolled. During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband IoT deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled. We have issued RFI/Ps to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our 5G Network Deployment.
​
Since 2008, we have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of over $21 billion, as described further below. The $21 billion of investments related to wireless spectrum licenses described below does not include $5 billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses.  See Note 2 “Capitalized Interest” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on capitalized interest.
​
DISH Network Spectrum. We have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. In March 2017, we notified the FCC that we planned to deploy a narrowband IoT network on certain of these wireless licenses, which was to be the First Phase. We expected to complete the First Phase by March 2020, with subsequent phases to be completed thereafter. We have entered into vendor contracts with multiple parties for, among other things, base stations, chipsets, modules, tower leases, the core network, RF design, and deployment services for the First Phase.  Among other things, initial RF design in connection with the First Phase was complete, we had secured certain tower sites, and we were in the process of identifying and securing additional tower sites.  The core network had been installed and commissioned.  We installed the first base stations on sites in 2018 and were in the process of deploying the remaining base stations.  During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband IoT deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled as discussed above.  In addition, we have issued RFI/Ps to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our 5G Network Deployment.  We currently expect expenditures for our wireless projects to be between $250 million and $500 million during 2020, excluding capitalized interest.  We currently expect expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to be approximately $10 billion, excluding capitalized interest. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we will incur significant additional expenses and will have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. See Note 2 “Capitalized Interest” and  Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses. During 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we initially made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in “FCC authorizations” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. The Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may be obtained from third party sources or from us, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any loans, equity contributions or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
​
Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity
​
The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Critical Accounting Estimates
​
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

​
Long-Lived Assets
​
Valuation of long-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset would be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its undiscounted future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value as estimated using one of the following approaches: income, cost and/or market. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount. In that event, a loss is recorded in “Impairment of long-lived assets” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. Fair value, using the income approach, is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model that uses the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Fair value, utilizing the cost approach, is determined based on the replacement cost of the asset reduced for, among other things, depreciation and obsolescence. Fair value, utilizing the market approach, benchmarks the fair value against the carrying amount. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We currently evaluate our DBS satellite fleet for impairment as one asset group whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant.
​
DBS Licenses. We combine all of our indefinite-lived DBS licenses that we currently utilize or plan to utilize in the future into a single unit of accounting. For 2019, 2018 and 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the DBS licenses exceeds its carrying amount. In our assessment, we considered several factors, including, among others, overall financial performance, industry and market considerations, and relevant company specific events. In contemplating all factors in their totality, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the DBS licenses exceeds its carrying amount. As such, no further analysis was required.
​
Wireless Spectrum Licenses. We currently combine our 600 MHz, 700 MHz, AWS-4 and H Block wireless spectrum licenses and the Northstar Licenses and SNR Licenses into a single unit of accounting. In 2019, management performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceed their carrying amount. In our assessment we considered several factors, including, among other things, the projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, and market transactions for wireless spectrum licenses including auction results. In assessing these factors we considered both macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions. In contemplating all factors in their totality, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceed their carrying amount.
​
In 2018, we assessed these licenses quantitatively. Our quantitative assessment consisted of both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach estimated the fair value of these licenses using the “Greenfield” approach. The Greenfield approach values the licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. The market approach uses prior transactions including auctions to estimate the fair value of the licenses. In conducting this quantitative assessment, we determined that the fair value of these licenses exceeds their carrying amount under both approaches.

​
In 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeded their carrying amount. In our assessment, we considered several qualitative factors, including, among others, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, relevant company specific events, and perception of the market. In contemplating all factors in their totality, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeded their carrying amount.
​
During 2019, 2018, and 2017, our multichannel video distribution and data service (“MVDDS”) wireless spectrum licenses were assessed as a single unit of accounting.  For 2019, management assessed these licenses qualitatively. Our qualitative assessment focused on recent auction results and historical market activity. We concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these licenses exceeded their carrying amount. For 2018 and 2017, management assessed these licenses quantitatively.  Our quantitative assessment in each year for these licenses consisted of a market approach.  The market approach uses prior transactions including auctions to estimate the fair value of the licenses.  In conducting these quantitative assessments, we determined that the fair value of these licenses exceeded their carrying amount.
​
During 2019, our 28 GHz and 24 GHz wireless spectrum licenses were assessed as a single unit of accounting. These licenses were purchased during the fourth quarter 2019 through our participation in Auction 101 and Auction 102. For 2019, management’s assessment of the fair value of these licenses was determined based on the auction results.
​
Changes in circumstances or market conditions could result in a write-down of any of the above wireless spectrum licenses in the future.
​
Income Taxes
​
Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either “Income tax (provision) benefit, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within “Stockholders’ equity (deficit)” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations.
​
Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position. Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our “Income tax provision (benefit), net,” which could be material to our consolidated results of operations.
​
Contingent Liabilities
​
A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to “General and administrative expenses” or “Litigation expense” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

New Accounting Pronouncements
​
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net earnings. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We currently expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
​
Fair Value Measurement.  On August 28, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by adding, modifying or removing certain disclosures.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  Certain disclosures in ASU 2018-13 are required to be applied on a retrospective basis and others on a prospective basis.  We currently expect that the adoption of ASU 2018-13 will have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our 70 ADOBE INC.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class a...
