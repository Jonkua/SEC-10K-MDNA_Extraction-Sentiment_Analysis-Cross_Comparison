Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate.
The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that began operations in 1986 and is the sole general partner of the Partnership. The Partnership is a limited partnership formed in 1993, at which time all of the properties and related assets and liabilities of the General Partner, as well as proceeds from a secondary offering of the General Partner's common shares, were contributed to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. We operate the General Partner and the Partnership as one enterprise, and therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Partnership, collectively.
At December 31, 2019, we:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Owned or jointly controlled 519 primarily industrial properties, of which 497 properties with 146.4 million square feet were in service and 22 properties with 8.9 million square feet were under development. The 497 in-service properties were comprised of 459 consolidated properties with 135.5 million square feet and 38 unconsolidated joint venture properties with 11.0 million square feet. The 22 properties under development consisted of 21 consolidated properties with 8.7 million square feet and one unconsolidated joint venture property with 133,000 square feet.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Owned directly, or through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 1,380 acres of land and controlled approximately 1,000 acres through purchase options.

Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential.
Operational Strategy
Our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as NAREIT FFO through (i) maintaining property occupancy and increasing rental rates, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) selectively developing new build-to-suit, substantially pre-leased and, in select markets, speculative development projects; and (iii) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.

-22-

Asset Strategy
Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in coastal Tier 1 markets which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions and new development activity. We are continuing to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities, identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives and continually evaluating our portfolio for disposition by regularly identifying assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.
Capital Strategy
Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2019, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
In support of our capital strategy, we employ an asset disposition program to sell non-strategic real estate assets, which generate proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or otherwise manage our capital structure.
We continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be in a very strong position to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Strategy
We are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles. We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with U.S. Green Building Council’s® Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED®), including constructing to LEED® criteria and achieving certification in all new developments where feasible. While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider since 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control. In 2018, we also became a member of GRESB, a leading provider of real estate ESG benchmarking and performance assessments. In 2019, as evidence of our commitment and continued progress, we increased our GRESB score significantly, and we expect to continue participating in the GRESB benchmarking assessments.

In October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard. The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K. We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics. Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.

Topic Accounting Metric Code Our Information
Energy Management Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy IF-RE-130a.5 We integrate energy usage reduction measures on all new developments, incorporating LEED certification requirements and applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include energy modeling, high efficiency equipment (HVAC and lighting), and climate zone appropriate design factors. We have an ongoing lighting retrofit program, replacing outdated light fixtures with LED high efficiency fixtures.
Water Management Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks IF-RE-140a.4 We integrate water reduction measures on all new developments and renovation, incorporating LEED certification or applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include the use of WaterSense® fixtures for all domestic usage, xeriscaping to minimize or eliminate the need for irrigation, and water usage monitoring, where available and appropriate.
Climate Change Adaptation Area of properties located in 100-year flood zones, by property subsector IF-RE-450a.1 7.0 million square feet.

In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a stated interest rate of 2.88%, which mature in November 2029. These notes represent the first green bond issuance in the United States by an industrial REIT. The net proceeds will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed “Eligible Green Projects”. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control.

In addition to our environmental initiatives, we are committed to fair compensation, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing employees with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work. Among other community service opportunities, we hold an annual day of service during which all employees are encouraged to volunteer in their local communities. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for employee donations to charities). We maintain a formal and structured diversity and inclusion program and have increased diversity within our board of directors, which is now 31% female. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.

We strive to maintain an effective corporate governance structure and comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies. Further, we have a public Corporate Responsibility Policy that formally communicates our commitments and leadership around ESG issues. Please see “Item 1-Corporate Governance” for more information regarding our governance initiatives.

-24-

Through all of our environmental, social and governance efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and community, while also benefiting our investors, employees, tenants and the communities in which we operate.

Year in Review
Overall, the economy performed well, with estimated growth in the United States gross domestic product of 2.3% for 2019. There continued to be positive momentum in some key areas, such as labor and consumer spending, but the overall economic environment was also negatively impacted by trade war concerns, gulf tensions and geopolitical matters. Short term and long term interest rates trended down for most of 2019 with the 10 year Treasury rate fluctuating from 1.5% to 2.8% and ending the year at 1.9%, down from 2.7% at the end of 2018. The continued growth of e-commerce and supply chain modernization has continued to be a significant positive factor for the industrial real estate sector, especially in high demand and land-constrained markets, while the issues facing some traditional retail operators have not significantly impacted our business. Under these conditions we were able to execute our asset and capital strategies for the year and had a successful 2019.
Net income attributable to the common shareholders of the General Partner for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $429.0 million, compared to net income of $383.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income attributable to the common unitholders of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $432.7 million, compared to net income of $387.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income in 2019 for the General Partner and the Partnership, when compared to 2018, was primarily the result of new industrial properties being placed in service, improved operational performance in our existing industrial portfolio and gains on property sales, which were partially offset by the impact of the accounting requirement in 2019 to immediately expense certain internal direct lease costs that were previously capitalizable.
NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders of the General Partner totaled $510.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $484.0 million for 2018. NAREIT FFO attributable to common unitholders of the Partnership totaled $514.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $488.5 million for 2018. The increase to NAREIT FFO from 2018 for the General Partner and the Partnership was driven by the same factors that led to the increased net income attributable to common shareholders in 2019 with the exception of gains on property sales.
The following table shows a reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders to the calculation of NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively (in thousands):

In accordance with our strategic plan, we continue to increase our investment in high-quality industrial properties, with build-to-suit developments across all of our markets and most of our speculative development focused in the markets we believe have the best long-term growth potential. Additionally, we continued to maintain high occupancy levels through 2019 and quickly lease a significant portion of our speculative development projects. Highlights of our 2019 strategic and operational activities are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We generated $432.7 million of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of 28 consolidated buildings and 110 acres of wholly owned undeveloped land.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We acquired six industrial properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 totaling $217.1 million.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We started new development projects with expected total costs of $1.09 billion, which included $8.2 million of expected total costs for a development project started within one unconsolidated joint venture. The development projects started in 2019 were, in aggregate, 54.6% leased at December 31, 2019.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We placed 19 newly completed wholly owned development projects in service, which totaled 7.3 million square feet with total costs of $578.4 million. These properties were 79.3% leased at December 31, 2019.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The total estimated cost of our properties under construction at December 31, 2019, with costs for unconsolidated properties shown at 100%, totaled $1.06 billion, with $541.1 million of such costs already incurred. The total estimated cost for one unconsolidated joint venture property under construction at December 31, 2019 was $8.2 million, with $5.2 million of such costs already incurred. The consolidated properties under construction were 55.1% pre-leased, while the unconsolidated joint venture property under construction was 100% pre-leased.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $440.9 million and $392.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Same-property net operating income, on a cash basis, as defined hereafter under "Supplemental Performance Measures", increased by 4.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• As the result of leasing up space in speculative developments throughout 2019, the percentage of total square feet leased for our in-service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from 96.4% at December 31, 2018 to 96.6% at December 31, 2019.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties totaled 24.3 million square feet in 2019 compared to 24.1 million square feet in 2018. The mix in leasing activity between renewals and the leasing of new developments was generally consistent with 2018.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in 2019 included 10.9 million square feet of lease renewals, which represented a 79.1% retention rate on a square foot basis. New second generation and renewal leases, on a combined basis, executed for consolidated properties during the year resulted in a 27.3% increase to net effective rents ("net effective rents" is defined hereafter in the "Key Performance Indicators" section) when compared to the previous leases of the same space.

We utilized the capital generated from dispositions during the year to reduce debt and to fund our development activities. Highlights of our key financing activities are as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2019, the General Partner issued 8.0 million common shares pursuant to its at the market ("ATM") equity programs, generating gross proceeds of $266.3 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of $263.3 million.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of 2.88% and mature on November 15, 2029. In connection with this offering, we settled the outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps, which were designated hedges for this offering, for a cash

-27-

payment of $35.6 million. When including the impact of interest rate swap amortization from accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL"), the effective interest rate on these notes was 3.96%.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In October 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which had a scheduled maturity date of February 2021 and bore a stated interest rate of 3.88% and an effective rate of 3.91%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.3 million, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In August 2019, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.38%, have an effective interest rate of 2.80%, and mature on December 15, 2027.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2019, we repaid three fixed rate secured loans, totaling $41.7 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.76%.

Supplemental Performance Measures

In addition to NAREIT FFO we use (i) Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("PNOI") and (ii) Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis ("SPNOI") as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes that the use of PNOI and SPNOI combined with net income (which remains the primary measure of performance), improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI and SPNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes.

PNOI and SPNOI each exclude expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes, or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, these metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Property Level Net Operating Income - Cash Basis
PNOI is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items. As a performance metric that consists of only the cash-based revenues and expenses directly related to ongoing real estate rental operations, PNOI is narrower in scope than NAREIT FFO.
PNOI, as we calculate it, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled, but differently calculated, measures for other REITs. We believe that PNOI is another useful supplemental performance measure, as it is an input in many REIT valuation models and it provides a means by which to evaluate the performance of the properties within our Rental Operations segments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as "Non-Reportable"), are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations."
The major factors influencing PNOI are occupancy levels, acquisitions and sales, development properties that achieve stabilized operations, rental rate increases or decreases, and the recoverability of operating expenses.
Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report shows a calculation of our PNOI for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and provides a reconciliation of PNOI for our Rental Operations segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes.
Same-Property Net Operating Income - Cash Basis
We also evaluate the performance of our properties, including our share of properties we jointly control, on a "same-property" basis, using a metric referred to as SPNOI. We view SPNOI as a useful supplemental performance measure because it improves comparability between periods by eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our portfolio.

-28-

On an individual property basis, SPNOI is generally computed in a consistent manner as PNOI.
Effective January 1, 2018, we define our "same-property" population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year and include buildings that were stabilized (the term "stabilized" means properties that have reached 90% leased or that have been in-service for at least one year since development completion or acquisition) as of January 1 of the prior calendar year. The "same-property" pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the "same-property" population for the period ended December 31, 2019 includes all properties that we owned or jointly controlled at January 1, 2019, which had both been owned or jointly controlled and had reached stabilization by January 1, 2018, and have not been sold.

A reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to SPNOI is presented as follows (in thousands, except percentage data):

---------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- ------- ---- -------------------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------ - ------- ------- - ------- ------- --- -

SPNOI $ 132,161 $ 127,474 3.7 % $ 521,731 $ 498,546 4.7 %

The composition of the line items titled "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI" and "Non-Segment Items" from the table above are shown in greater detail in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

We believe that the factors that impact SPNOI are generally the same as those that impact PNOI. The following table details the number of properties, square feet, average commencement occupancy and average cash rental rate for the properties included in SPNOI for the respective periods:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------------- ------- -------

(1) Includes the total square feet of the consolidated properties that are in the "same-property" population as well as 4.5 million square feet of space for unconsolidated joint ventures, which represents our ratable share of the 9.1 million total square feet of space for buildings owned by unconsolidated joint ventures that are in the "same-property" population.
(2) Commencement occupancy represents the percentage of total square feet where the leases have commenced.
(3) Represents the average annualized contractual rent per square foot for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for tenants in occupancy in properties in the "same-property" population. Cash rent does not include the tenant's obligation to pay property operating expenses and real estate taxes. If a tenant was within a free rent period, its rent would equal zero for purposes of this metric.

Key Performance Indicators
Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our Rental Operations. The following discussion highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider to be critical drivers of future revenues.
Occupancy Analysis
Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue. The following table sets forth percent leased and average net effective rent information regarding our in-service portfolio of rental properties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- --------------------------- ------- --------------- ----------------------------------- - ---- ----- ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- ----- ------ ------

* Represents the percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced.
** Average annual net effective rent represents average annual base rental payments per leased square foot, on a straight-line basis for the term of each lease, from space leased to tenants at the end of the most recent reporting period. This amount excludes additional amounts paid by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses.

The increase in occupancy at December 31, 2019 within our industrial portfolio, when compared to December 31, 2018, primarily resulted from leasing up recently delivered speculative developments while renewing or backfilling existing leases to maintain the occupancy level within our existing base of properties.
Vacancy Activity
The following table sets forth vacancy activity, shown in square feet, from our in-service rental properties for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

Total Leasing Activity

The initial leasing of development projects or vacant space in acquired properties is referred to as first generation lease activity. Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates and net effective rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The leasing of such space that we have previously held under lease to a tenant is referred to as second generation lease activity. Second generation lease activity may be in the form of renewals of existing leases or new second generation leases of previously leased space. The total leasing activity for our consolidated and unconsolidated rental properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed, is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------- ------ ---- ------

 2019 2018

* Annualized rental revenue represents average annual base rental payments, on a straight-line basis for the term of each lease, from space leased to tenants at the end of the most recent reporting period. Annualized rental revenue excludes additional amounts paid by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses.

Building Acquisitions
Our decision process in determining whether or not to acquire a property or portfolio of properties involves several factors, including expected rent growth, multiple yield metrics, property locations and expected demographic growth in each location, current occupancy of the properties, tenant profile and remaining terms of the in-place leases in the properties. We pursue both brokered and non-brokered acquisitions, and it is difficult to predict which markets may present acquisition opportunities that align with our strategy. Because of the numerous factors considered in our acquisition decisions, we do not establish specific target yields for future acquisitions.
We acquired six buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 and nine buildings during the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the acquisition price, percent leased at time of acquisition and in-place yields, by product type, for these acquisitions (in thousands, except percentage data):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ------- ----------------- ------------------------------------- - ------------------ ---- ---------------- ------------------------------------- ------- --- - ----- -

* Includes fair value of real estate assets and net acquired lease-related intangible assets, including above or below market leases, but excludes other acquired working capital assets and liabilities.
** In-place yields of completed acquisitions are calculated as the current annualized net rental payments from space leased to tenants at the date of acquisition, divided by the acquisition price of the acquired real estate. Annualized net rental payments are comprised of base rental payments, excluding additional amounts payable by tenants as reimbursement for operating expenses, less current annualized operating expenses not recovered through tenant reimbursements.
*** Represents percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced, at the date of acquisition.

Building Dispositions

We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. We sold 28 consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 15 consolidated buildings during the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the sales prices, in-place yields and percent leased, by product type, of these buildings (in thousands, except percentage data):

Total $ 425,767 5.6 % 91.4 % $ 505,214 5.4 % 95.8 %

* In-place yields of completed dispositions are calculated as annualized net operating income from space leased to tenants at the date of sale on a lease-up basis, including full rent from all executed leases, even if currently in a free rent period, divided by the sales price. Annualized net operating income is comprised of base rental payments, excluding reimbursement of operating expenses, less current annualized operating expenses not recovered through tenant reimbursements.
** Represents percentage of total square feet leased based on executed leases and without regard to whether the leases have commenced, at the date of sale.

Development
Another source of our earnings growth is our consolidated and unconsolidated joint venture development activities. We expect to generate future earnings from Rental Operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased.
We had 8.9 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of $1.06 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to 9.5 million square feet with total estimated costs upon completion of $814.1 million at December 31, 2018. The square footage and estimated costs include both consolidated properties and unconsolidated joint venture development activity at 100%. The following table summarizes our properties under development at December 31, 2019 (in thousands, except percentage data):

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ----- - -------

 2019 2018
Rental and related revenue:
Industrial $ 848,806 $ 775,713
Non-Reportable Rental Operations and non-segment revenues 7,027 9,606
Total rental and related revenue from continuing operations $ 855,833 $ 785,319
Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations — 117
Total rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations $ 855,833 $ 785,436

The primary reasons for the increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We acquired 15 properties and placed 37 developments in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, which provided incremental revenues from continuing operations of $65.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to 2018.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased rental rates and, to a lesser extent, occupancy within our "same-property" portfolio, as well as the lease up of properties that were placed in service prior to January 1, 2018 but were not in the "same-property" portfolio, also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations. Average rental rates and commencement occupancy in our "same-property" portfolio both increased from the year ended December 31, 2018.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The sale of 43 in-service properties since January 1, 2018, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, resulted in a decrease of $21.3 million to rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018, which partially offset the aforementioned increases to rental and related revenue from continuing operations.

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes
The following table sets forth rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ----- - -------

 2019 2018
Rental expenses:
Industrial $ 74,083 $ 67,259
Non-Reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses 1,501 4,177
Total rental expenses from continuing operations $ 75,584 $ 71,436
Rental expenses from discontinued operations — (8 )
Total rental expenses from continuing and discontinued operations $ 75,584 $ 71,428
Real estate taxes:
Industrial $ 128,887 $ 122,788
Non-Reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses 633 2,481
Total real estate tax expense from continuing operations $ 129,520 $ 125,269
Real estate tax expense from discontinued operations — 17
Total real estate tax expense from continuing and discontinued operations $ 129,520 $ 125,286

-34-

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $4.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Overall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 and increased real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority. The increases were partially offset by the impact of an accounting requirement that became effective in 2019, which no longer allows reporting revenues and expenses for real estate taxes paid by tenants directly to taxing authorities, as well as the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.
Service Operations
The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------- -------- ------- ---- -------- - -------

 2019 2018
Service Operations:
General contractor and service fee revenue $ 117,926 $ 162,551
General contractor and other services expenses (111,566 ) (153,909 )
Net earnings from Service Operations $ 6,360 $ 8,642

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction management and general contractor services for unconsolidated joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. Service Operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy, while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners.

Net earnings from service operations decreased as the result of lower third party general contractor construction volume during 2019.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $327.2 million and $312.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisition.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that generally own and operate rental properties. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $31.4 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In 2019, we recorded equity in earnings of $19.4 million related to our share of the gain on sale of five unconsolidated joint venture buildings and equity in earnings of $1.3 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture.
In 2018, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on sale of our ownership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture and equity in earnings of $3.9 million representing our share of gains on involuntary conversion from insurance recoveries related to storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.

-35-

Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations
We sold 28 properties during 2019 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $234.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.
We sold 15 properties during 2018 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $205.0 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.
Gain on Sale of Land
Gain on sale of land was $7.4 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We sold 110 acres of undeveloped land in 2019 compared to 187 acres of undeveloped land in 2018.
Non-Incremental Costs Related to Successful Leases
As the result of adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report), $12.4 million of non-incremental costs related to successful leases were expensed during 2019. As we have adopted the standard on a prospective basis, there was no adjustment to non-incremental costs previously capitalized for 2018.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes general corporate expenses, and the second component represents the indirect operating costs not allocated to, or absorbed by, either the development, leasing and operation of our consolidated properties or our Service Operations. Such indirect operating costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation, including related costs such as benefits and wage-related taxes, but also include other ancillary costs such as travel and information technology support. Total indirect operating costs, prior to any allocation or absorption, and general corporate expenses are collectively referred to as our overall pool of overhead costs.
Those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. We regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing, development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead, generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments, as necessary, in order to control overall general and administrative expense.
General and administrative expenses were $60.9 million and $56.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2018 to 2019 (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ----

General and administrative expenses - 2018 $ 56.2
Decrease to overall pool of overhead costs (3.3 )
Decreased absorption of costs by consolidated leasing and development activities (1) 5.4
Decreased allocation of costs to Rental Operations and Service Operations 2.6
General and administrative expenses - 2019 $ 60.9

(1) We capitalized $6.8 million and $24.2 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2019, compared to capitalizing $19.0 million and $29.8 million of such costs, respectively, for 2018. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 22.8% and 35.1% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in overhead costs capitalized to leasing was primarily due to $12.4 million of previously capitalizable internal costs that were immediately expensed due to the adoption of a new lease accounting requirement in 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and presented separately in the line item "Non-incremental costs related to successful leases" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

-36-

Interest Expense
Interest expense allocable to continuing operations was $89.8 million and $85.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was largely the result of increased overall borrowings, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
We capitalized $26.5 million and $27.2 million of interest costs during 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Debt Extinguishment
During 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated interest rate of 3.88%. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.3 million, which included a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
During 2018, we repaid three secured loans, totaling $227.1 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.62%. We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $388,000 from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Rental and Related Revenue

The following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ------ - -------

 2018 2017
Rental and related revenue:
Industrial $ 775,713 $ 661,226
Non-Reportable Rental Operations and non-segment revenues 9,606 25,288
Total rental and related revenue from continuing operations $ 785,319 $ 686,514
Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations 117 87,185
Total rental and related revenue from continuing and discontinued operations $ 785,436 $ 773,699

The primary reasons for the increase in rental and related revenue from continuing operations were:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The acquisition of 36 properties and placing of 41 developments in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 provided combined incremental revenues of $106.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased occupancy and rental rates within our "same-property" portfolio also contributed to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations. Average commencement occupancy and rental rates in our "same-property" portfolio both increased, as compared to 2017.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expense reimbursements increased primarily due to increased real estate taxes in our existing properties, as compared to 2017.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The above items contributing to the increase to rental and related revenue from continuing operations were partially offset by the sale of 28 in-service properties since January 1, 2017, which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations, and resulted in a $35.7 million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017.

Rental and related revenue from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased compared to 2017 as the result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.

Total real estate tax expense from continuing operations $ 125,269 $ 108,964
Real estate tax expense from discontinued operations 17 9,869
Total real estate tax expense from continuing and discontinued operations $ 125,286 $ 118,833

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $8.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $16.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in services from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 and an increase in real estate taxes on our existing base of properties. These increases to real estate tax expense were partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

The decreases in both rental expenses and real estate tax expense from discontinued operations were a result of the properties classified within discontinued operations being sold throughout 2017.
Service Operations
The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------- -------- ------- ---- ------- - ------

 2018 2017
Service Operations:
General contractor and service fee revenue $ 162,551 $ 94,420
General contractor and other services expenses (153,909 ) (89,457 )
Net earnings from Service Operations $ 8,642 $ 4,963

Net earnings from service operations increased as the result of a higher volume of third party construction projects during 2018.

-38-

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $312.2 million and $273.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of properties acquired and the developments placed in service from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. The impact of acquired properties and developments placed in service was partially offset by property dispositions that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $21.4 million and $63.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In 2018, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on sale of our ownership joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.
In 2017, we recorded $53.9 million to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures as the result of the gains on sale of our ownership interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as our share of the gain on the sale of one property from an unconsolidated joint venture. These transactions included $47.5 million in gains from the sale of our ownership interests in two joint ventures in connection with the sale of our medical office portfolio (the "Medical Office Portfolio Disposition").
Promote Income
We recognized $20.0 million of promote income from the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, as part of the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, during the year ended December 31, 2017. We did not recognize any promote income during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Gain on Sale of Properties - Continuing Operations

We sold 15 properties 
We sold 17 properties during 2017 that were classified in continuing operations, recognizing total gains on sale of $113.7 million. These properties did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Gain on Sale of Land
Gain on sale of land was $10.3 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We sold 187 acres of undeveloped land in 2018 compared to 166 acres of undeveloped land in 2017.

General and administrative expenses were $56.2 million and $54.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2017 to 2018 (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ----

General and administrative expenses - 2017 $ 54.9
Decrease to overall pool of overhead costs (0.8 )
Decreased absorption of costs by wholly owned development and leasing activities (1) 1.8
Decreased allocation of costs to Service Operations and Rental Operations 0.3
General and administrative expenses - 2018 $ 56.2

(1) We capitalized $19.0 million and $29.8 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development, respectively, for consolidated properties during 2018, compared to capitalizing $19.1 million and $31.5 million of such costs, respectively, for 2017. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 35.1% and 36.2% of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest Expense
Interest expense allocable to continuing operations was $85.0 million and $87.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest expense from continuing operations was largely the result of higher capitalization of interest due to an overall increase in development activities. We capitalized $27.2 million of interest costs during 2018 compared to $18.9 million during 2017. No interest expense was classified within discontinued operations in 2018.
During 2017, $14.7 million of interest expense was classified within discontinued operations.
Debt Extinguishment
During 2018, we repaid three secured loans, totaling $227.1 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.62%. We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $388,000 from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
During 2017, we repaid our $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. We also repaid $285.6 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018 and $128.7 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $26.1 million from these transactions during the year ended 2017, which included prepayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
Discontinued Operations

The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss on the disposition of the properties and related income tax expense.
The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition in 2017 was comprised of 81 medical office properties which were classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, we classified operating income before gain on sales and income taxes of $18.4 million and gain on sales of properties of $1.36 billion in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The related income tax impact, totaling $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, was also reported in discontinued operations. There were no properties classified as held-for-sale and included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2018.
Discontinued operations is further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:
Cost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.
We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.
We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.
Effective on January 1, 2019, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases ("ASC 842"), only costs that are directly incremental to executing a lease are capitalized.
In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department-by-department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction and development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions, dispositions, non-incremental leasing costs and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non-payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non-capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs.
To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized construction and development costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards are based on a percentage of the total development costs of a project. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects are not capitalized.
Impairment of Real Estate Assets: We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is considered necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of that asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of

-41-

our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value.
The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. To the extent that the assumptions used in testing long-lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant, the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured. In addition to determining future cash flows, which make the estimation of a real estate asset's undiscounted cash flows highly subjective, the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective.
To the extent applicable marketplace data is available, we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired.
Real estate assets that are classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
Acquisition of Real Estate Property and Related Assets: We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This “as-if vacant” value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land.
The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical lease up periods, related to space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition. These estimates include (i) lost rent at market rates, (ii) fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and (iii) theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease.

To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of pre-existing equity interest and the consideration paid for additional interest acquired and do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when the contingency is paid or becomes payable.

-42-

To the extent that we gain control of a property acquired that meets the definition of a business, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest. Additionally, contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period.
The audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, including payments of dividends and distributions and the capital expenditures needed to maintain our current real estate assets, primarily through working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We had no outstanding borrowings on the Partnership's $1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, had $110.9 million of cash on hand and held $1.7 million of restricted cash for future like kind exchange transactions at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we also held $110.0 million of notes receivable from the 2017 Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.
 In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.
Rental Operations
Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.
We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.
Unsecured Debt and Equity Securities
Our unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2019 is described as follows (in thousands):

-------------------------------------- ----------------- --------- ------------ ---------------------------------------- - -

Description BorrowingCapacity MaturityDate Outstanding Balance at December 31, 2019
Unsecured Line of Credit – Partnership $ 1,200,000 January 2022 $ —

The Partnership's unsecured line of credit has a borrowing capacity of $1.20 billion, with an interest rate on borrowings of LIBOR plus 0.875% and a maturity date of January 2022, with options to extend until January 30, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional $800.0 million, for a total of up to $2.00 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions.
This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit.

-43-

In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR") replace LIBOR. ARRC also proposed that the transition to SOFR from LIBOR take place by the end of 2021. As the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement has provisions that allow for automatic transition to a new rate, the Partnership has no other material debt arrangements that are indexed to LIBOR, and has settled all outstanding interest rate swaps in November 2019, we believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2019, we had on file with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities (including guarantees of the Partnership's debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.
On August 1, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership terminated the equity distribution agreement for the ATM equity program with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million. Prior to the termination, the General Partner issued 1.8 million common shares in 2019 pursuant to its previous ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $56.3 million after paying total compensation of $568,000 to the applicable sales agents. On August 2, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership entered into a new equity distribution agreement to sell shares of the General Partner’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering price of $400.0 million. Pursuant to the new ATM equity program, the General Partner issued a total of 6.2 million common shares during 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $207.3 million after paying total compensation of $2.1 million to the applicable sales agents. Of the total activity in 2019 under the new ATM program, 1.4 million common shares were issued during the three months ended December 31, 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $47.7 million after paying total compensation of $482,000 to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to all 2019 issuances, totaling $325,000, were also paid during 2019. The issuances resulted in net proceeds of $263.3 million under both ATM programs during 2019.

In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 2.88%, have an effective interest rate of 3.96% when including the impact of interest rate swap amortization from AOCL, and mature on November 15, 2029, for gross proceeds of $399.9 million.

In August 2019, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.38%, have an effective interest of 2.80%, and mature on December 15, 2027, for gross proceeds of $182.3 million.
The Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, at December 31, 2019.
Sale of Real Estate Assets
We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non-strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.
Sales of land and depreciable properties provided $432.7 million in net proceeds in 2019, compared to $511.4 million in 2018 and $2.52 billion in 2017. We also held $110.0 million of notes receivable related to the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition at December 31, 2019, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.

-44-

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. During 2019, our share of sale and capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled $26.3 million.
Uses of Liquidity
Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

- --------------------
• property investment;

- ----------------------
• leasing/capital costs;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

- --------------------------
• long-term debt maturities;

- --------------------------------------------------
• opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt; and

- ------------------------------
• other contractual obligations.

Property Investment
Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.
Leasing/Capital Costs
Tenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while such expenditures for capitalizable lease-related costs are included within "other deferred leasing costs."
Cash expenditures related to the construction of a building's shell, as well as the associated site improvements, are also included within "development of real estate investments" in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Tenant improvements and leasing costs to renew or re-let rental space that we previously leased to tenants for second generation leases are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant, but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties, are also second generation expenditures. One of the principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments.

-45-

The following table summarizes our second generation capital expenditures by type of expenditure, as well as capital expenditures for the development of real estate investments and for other deferred leasing costs (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------- ------ ------- ---- ------ ---- ------- ------ - -------

 2019 2018 2017
Second generation tenant improvements $ 12,165 $ 18,797 $ 15,239
Second generation leasing costs 22,879 24,899 22,712
Building improvements 12,505 9,778 14,603
Total second generation capital expenditures $ 47,549 $ 53,474 $ 52,554
Development of real estate investments $ 446,801 $ 577,383 $ 549,563
Other deferred leasing costs $ 38,509 $ 39,380 $ 30,208

We had consolidated properties under development with an expected total cost of $1.05 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to projects with an expected cost of $709.7 million and $642.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The capital expenditures in the table above include the capitalization of internal overhead costs. We capitalized $6.8 million, $19.0 million and $19.1 million of overhead costs related to leasing activities, including both first and second generation leases, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We capitalized $24.2 million, $29.8 million and $31.5 million of overhead costs related to development activities, including both development and tenant improvement projects on first and second generation space, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 22.8%, 35.1% and 36.2% of our overall pool of overhead costs at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the overhead costs capitalized to leasing for 2019 was primarily due to the expense impact of internal costs related to successful leasing which were not capitalizable as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report) and was included in the line item "Non-incremental costs related to successful leases" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 2019.

Further discussion of the capitalization of overhead costs can be found in the year-to-year comparisons of general and administrative expenses and Critical Accounting Policies sections of this Item 7.

In addition to the capitalization of overhead costs, the totals for development of real estate assets in the table above include the capitalization of $26.5 million, $27.2 million and $18.9 million of interest costs in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis, dependent upon several factors including the product type, the nature of a tenant's operations, the specific physical characteristics of each individual property and the market in which the property is located.
Dividend and Distribution Requirements
The General Partner is required to meet the distribution requirements of the Code in order to maintain its REIT status. We paid regular dividends or distributions of $0.88, $0.815 and $0.77 per common share or Common Unit for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also paid a special dividend of $0.85 per common share or Common Unit during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the significant taxable gains on asset sales completed in that year.
We expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings, to meet the requirements to maintain the General Partner's REIT status, and additional amounts as determined by the General Partner's board of directors. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partner's board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the General Partner's board of directors deems relevant.

-46-

Debt Maturities
Debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 had a face value totaling $2.93 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.73% and maturities at various dates through 2029. Of this total amount, we had $2.90 billion of unsecured debt, $34.1 million of secured debt and no outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit at December 31, 2019. Scheduled principal amortization, maturities and early repayments of such debt totaled $325.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The following table is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2019 (in thousands, except percentage data):

Thereafter — — — N/A
 $ 25,088 $ 2,909,047 $ 2,934,135 3.73%

We anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our Rental Operations and property dispositions and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions.
Repayments of Outstanding Debt
To the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy, we may purchase or redeem some of our outstanding unsecured notes prior to their stated maturities.
During 2019, we repaid three fixed rate secured loans, totaling $41.7 million, which had a weighted average stated interest rate of 7.76%.
In October 2019, we redeemed $250.0 million of unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in February 2021.
Guarantee Obligations
We are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments.

Historical Cash Flows
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $121.4 million, $25.5 million and $193.6 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The following table highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):

Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 145,090 (58,087 ) (1,089,526 )

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet our operational requirements and the receipt of rental income from Rental Operations continues to be our primary source of operating cash flows. The increase to net cash provided by operating activities, compared to 2018, was due to the timing of cash receipts and cash payments on third party construction projects as well as increased cash flows from our Rental Operations. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash paid for interest and income taxes as well as the timing of working capital.
The increase to cash flow provided by operating activities between 2017 and 2018 was the result of higher cash flows from rental operations and lower cash paid for interest, partially offset by a $20.0 million promote payment received in connection with the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition during 2017.
Investing Activities
Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Real estate development costs were $446.8 million, $577.4 million, and $549.6 million during 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We paid cash of $598.4 million, $592.4 million and $1.23 billion, for real estate and undeveloped land acquisitions during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Sales of land and property generated net proceeds of $432.7 million, $511.4 million and $2.52 billion during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2019, we received repayments of $162.6 million on notes receivable from property sales, compared to $154.1 million and $3.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Impact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service, upgraded in 2016 from Baa2. In addition, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, upgraded in 2016 from BBB. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

The ratings of our senior unsecured notes could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

Financial Instruments

We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
We have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operation and development of industrial real estate properties. These investments provide us with increased market share and tenant and property diversification. The equity method of accounting is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet.
Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures represented approximately 2% and 1% of our total assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We believe that these investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.
The following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands, except percentage data):

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- ----- - -------

 2019 2018
Rental expenses:
Industrial $ 74,083 $ 67,259
Non-Reportable Rental Operations and non-segment expenses 1,501 4,177
Total rental expenses from continuing operations $ 75,584 $ 71,436

Real estate tax expense from discontinued operations — 17
Total real estate tax expense from continuing and discontinued operations $ 129,520 $ 125,286

-34-

Overall, rental expenses from continuing operations increased by $4.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase to rental expenses was primarily the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, partially offset by the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.

Overall, real estate tax expense from continuing operations increased by $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase to real estate taxes was mainly the result of acquisitions and developments placed in service from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 and increased real estate taxes levied by the related taxing by tenants directly to taxing authorities, as well as the impact of property sales that did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations.
Service Operations
The following table sets forth the components of net earnings from the Service Operations reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------- -------- ------- ---- -------- - -------

Service Operations:
General contractor and service fee revenue $ 117,926 $ 162,551
General contractor and other services expenses (111,566 ) (153,909 )
Net earnings from Service Operations $ 6,360 $ 8,642

Service Operations primarily consist of the leasing, property management, asset management, development, construction management and general contractor fees are dependent upon occupancy, while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third-party property owners and joint venture partners.

Net earnings from service operations decreased as the result of lower third party general contractor construction volume during 2019.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations was $327.2 million and $312.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of continued growth in our portfolio through development and acquisition.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures $31.4 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In 2019, we recorded equity in earnings of $19.4 million related to our share of the gain on sale of five joint venture.
In 2018, we recorded equity in earnings of $12.1 million related to our share of the gain on sale of six unconsolidated joint venture buildings, as well as the gain on storm damage in one unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by a $2.2 million impairment charge for one unconsolidated joint venture.

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component includes pool of overhead costs.
Those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. We regularly review our total overhead cost structure in order to control overall general and administrative expense.
General and administrative expenses were $60.9 million and $56.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2018 to 2019 (in millions):

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $56.2 million and $54.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2017 to 2018 (in millions):

We also repaid $7.0 million of unsecured debt, which had a stated interest rate of 6.26%. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $388,000 from these transactions including a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
During 2017, we repaid our $250.0 million variable rate term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of January 2019 and bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. We also repaid $285.6 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of January 2018 and $128.7 million of senior unsecured notes with a scheduled maturity date of March 2020. We recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $26.1 million from these transactions during the year ended 2017, which included prepayment premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
Discontinued Operations

The property-specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss on the disposition of the properties and related income tax expense.
The Medical Office Portfolio Disposition in 2017 was comprised of 81 medical office properties which were classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, we classified operating income before gain on sales and income taxes of $18.4 million and gain on sales of properties of $1.36 billion in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions:
Cost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property.
We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We capitalize all such costs through the completion of the building shell. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt.
We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease-up periods, after construction of the building shell has been completed, if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods after the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy.

At December 31, 2019, we also held $110.0 million of notes receivable from the 2017 Medical Office Portfolio Disposition, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.
 In addition to our existing sources of liquidity, we expect to meet long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other capital improvements, through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow, proceeds from property dispositions and accessing the public debt and equity markets.
Rental Operations
Cash flows from Rental Operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable source of cash flow to fund operational expenses. We believe that this cash-based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for items such as periodic straight-line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of, or a short time following, the actual revenue recognition.
We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions, including reduced occupancy, tenant defaults and bankruptcies and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re-letting of properties, any of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations.

['s debt securities by the General Partner). Equity securities are offered and sold by the General Partner, and the net proceeds of such offerings are contributed to the Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units or Preferred Units. From time to time, we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.
On August 1, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership terminated the equity distribution agreement for the ATM equity program with an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million. Prior to the termination, the General Partner issued 1.8 million common shares in 2019 pursuant to its previous ATM equity program, resulting in net proceeds of $56.3 million after paying total compensation of $568,000 to the applicable sales agents. On August 2, 2019, the General Partner and the Partnership entered into a new equity distribution agreement to sell shares of the General Partner’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering price of $400.0 million. Pursuant to the new ATM equity program, the General Partner issued a total of 6.2 million common shares during 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $207.3 million after paying total compensation of $2.1 million to the applicable sales agents. Of the total activity in 2019 under the new ATM program, 1.4 million common shares were issued during the three months ended December 31, 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $47.7 million after paying total compensation of $482,000 to the applicable sales agents. Other fees related to all 2019 issuances, totaling $325,000, were also paid during 2019. The issuances resulted in net proceeds of $263.3 million under both ATM programs during 2019.

In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 2.88%, have an effective interest rate of 3.96% when including the impact of interest rate swap amortization from AOCL, and mature on November 15, 2029, for gross proceeds of $399.9 million.

In August 2019, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.38%, have an effective interest of 2.80%, and mature on December 15, 2027, for gross proceeds of $182.3 million.
The Partnership has issued debt securities pursuant to certain indentures and related supplemental indentures, which also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants, as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit, at December 31, 2019.
Sale of Real Estate Assets
We regularly work to identify, consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non-strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans. Our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable. Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties.
Sales of land and depreciable properties provided $432.7 million in net proceeds in 2019, compared to $511.4 million in 2018 and $2.52 billion in 2017. We also held $110.0 million of notes receivable related to the Medical Office Portfolio Disposition at December 31, 2019, which matured and was paid in full in January 2020.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Transactions with unconsolidated joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated joint ventures, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own. Additionally, unconsolidated joint ventures will from time to time obtain debt financing or sell properties and will then distribute to us, and our joint venture partners, all or a portion of the proceeds from such transactions. During 2019, our share of sale and capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled $26.3 million.
Uses of Liquidity
Our principal uses of liquidity include the following:

- --------------------
• property investment;

- ----------------------
• leasing/capital costs;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders;

- --------------------------
• long-term debt maturities;

• other contractual obligations.

Property Investment
Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality industrial properties, primarily through development, on both a speculative and build-to-suit basis, supplemented with acquisitions in higher barrier markets with the highest growth potential. Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon our market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, and our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties.
Leasing/Capital Costs
Tenant improvements and lease-related costs pertaining to our initial leasing of newly completed space, or vacant space in acquired properties, are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such first generation expenditures for tenant improvements are included within "]:

[") Strategy
We are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to continually set the standard for maximizing stakeholder value, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles. We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with U.S. Green Building Council’s® Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED®), including constructing to LEED® criteria and achieving certification in all new developments where feasible. While we do not control most of the utility usage at our properties, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider since 2018 in order to help monitor and manage the utility usage that we do control. In 2018, we also became a member of GRESB, a leading provider of real estate ESG benchmarking and performance assessments. In 2019, as evidence of our commitment and continued progress, we increased our GRESB score significantly, and we expect to continue participating in the GRESB benchmarking assessments.

In October 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board issued the Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard. The standards are intended to provide a minimum set of sustainability metrics for disclosure in SEC filings, such as this Form 10-K. We understand the importance of reporting comparable, consistent and financially material sustainability metrics. Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable metrics.
