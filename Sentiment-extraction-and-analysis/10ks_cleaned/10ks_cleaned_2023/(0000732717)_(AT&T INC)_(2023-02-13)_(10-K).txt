On April 8, 2022, we closed our transaction to combine substantially all of our WarnerMedia segment (WarnerMedia) with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc (Discovery). Upon the separation and distribution of WarnerMedia, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&T’s single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and have determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic. These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. (See Notes 6 and 23)

On July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. (See Note 6)

We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America. Our segment results presented in Note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting. Each segment’s percentage calculation of total segment operating revenue is derived from our segment results table in Note 4. Segment operating income is attributable to our Communications segment due to operating losses in Latin America. Percentage increases and decreases that are not considered meaningful are denoted with a dash.

OVERVIEW

Operating revenues decreased in 2022 and 2021. The 2022 decline reflects the July 31, 2021 separation of the U.S. video business, other business divestitures that were not included in discontinued operations and lower Business Wireline revenues driven by lower demand for legacy services and product simplification. Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobility service and equipment revenues and, to a lesser extent, gains in broadband service in our Communications segment and growth in Mexico wireless operations.

The 2021 decline reflects the 2021 separation of the U.S. video business and the October 2020 sale of wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Also contributing to revenue declines was lower Business Wireline revenues due in part to higher demand for pandemic-related connectivity in the prior year. Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobility equipment and service revenues and gains in broadband service, and growth in Mexico wireless operations including favorable foreign exchange impacts.

Operations and support expenses decreased in 2022 and 2021. The 2022 decline reflects the separation of U.S. video and lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, the elimination of Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF II) government credits and increased wholesale network access charges. Wireless equipment costs were up slightly, with higher sales volumes and the sale of higher-priced smartphones largely offset by lower 3G shutdown costs in 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, we updated the expected economic lives of customer relationships, which extended the amortization period of deferred acquisition and fulfillment costs and reduced expenses approximately $395, with $150 recorded to Mobility, $115 to Business Wireline and $130 to Consumer Wireline.

The 2021 decline reflects our 2021 business divestitures, lower bad debt expense and lower personnel costs associated with our transformation initiatives. Declines were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher volumes.

Asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to $24,812 of noncash goodwill impairments associated with our Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units and were driven by higher interest rates consistent with the macroeconomic environment, with secular

20

AT&T Inc.
Dollars in millions except per share amounts

declines also impacting Business Wireline growth rates (see Note 9). The increase in 2022 also included $1,413 of wireline conduit asset abandonments (see Note 7) and $1,273 of restructuring and other impairment charges due to updated network build plans stemming from spectrum acquired in recent auctions, severance charges associated with transformation initiatives and impairment of personal protective equipment inventory.

Impairment charges in 2021 were lower than 2020, reflecting a fourth-quarter 2020 impairment charge of $15,508 resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the long-lived assets and goodwill associated with our U.S. video business.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021.
Depreciation expense increased $218, or 1.2%, in 2022. The increase was primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades and expansion, partially offset by higher estimated lives of our fiber assets (see Note 7). Depreciation expense decreased $1,394, or 7.3%, in 2021, primarily due to ceasing depreciation on U.S. video held-for-sale assets.

Amortization expense decreased $49, or 22.5%, in 2022 and $3,277, or 93.8%, in 2021. Lower amortization reflects our accelerated method of amortization of intangible assets from previous acquisitions and ceasing amortization on U.S. video held-for-sale assets in 2021.

Operating income decreased in 2022 and increased in 2021. Our operating margin was (3.8)% in 2022, compared to 19.3% in 2021 and 5.9% in 2020.

Interest expense decreased in 2022 primarily due to lower debt balances and higher capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, partially offset by higher debt balances.

Equity in net income of affiliates increased in 2022 and 2021, primarily due to the close of our transaction with TPG related to the U.S. video business, which resulted in our accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting beginning August 1, 2021 (see Notes 6, 10 and 19).

Other income (expense) – net decreased in 2022 and increased in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to lower actuarial gains ($1,999 in 2022 compared to $4,140 in 2021), lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments. Pension and postretirement benefit credits decreased as a result of higher assumed discount rates and lower returns on benefit plan assets. Our 2022 benefit expense also includes approximately $280 favorable impact from a retirement benefit plan change, with $230 resulting from prior service credits (approximately $100 for Business Wireline, $80 for Consumer Wireline and $40 for Mobility) (see Note 14).

The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the recognition of $4,140 in actuarial gains, compared to losses of $4,169 in 2020, and the recognition of $1,405 of debt redemption costs in 2020. Also contributing to increased income in 2021 were higher net pension and postretirement benefit credits from higher prior service credit amortization (see Note 14).

Income tax expense decreased in 2022 and increased in 2021. The 2022 decrease was primarily driven by lower income before income tax offset by impairments of goodwill (see Note 9), which are not deductible for tax purposes.

The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increased income before income taxes, offset primarily by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) benefit of U.S. federal Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryback and benefits of divestitures in 2021.

Our effective tax rate was (122.2)% in 2022, 18.5% in 2021, and (329.9)% in 2020. The effective tax rate was impacted by our goodwill impairments associated with our Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units in 2022, and Video goodwill impairment in 2020, which are not deductible for tax purposes.

Segment Results Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues.

In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified into “Corporate” certain administrative costs borne by AT&T where the business units do not influence decision making to conform with the current period presentation. This recast increased Corporate operations and support expenses by approximately $270 and $1,310 for full-year 2021 and 2020, respectively. Correspondingly, this recast lowered administrative expenses for the Communications segment, with no change on a consolidated basis.

Operating revenues increased in 2022, driven by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units, partially offset by a decrease in our Business Wireline business unit. The increases are primarily driven by wireless service and equipment revenue growth and gains in broadband service. Business Wireline continues to reflect lower demand for legacy services and product simplification.

Operating income increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021. The 2022 operating income reflects an increase in operating income from our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units, partially offset by declines in our Business Wireline business unit. Our Communications segment operating income margin was 24.9% in 2022, 24.7% in 2021 and 26.4% in 2020.

Service revenue increased during 2022, largely due to growth from subscriber gains and postpaid average revenue per subscriber (ARPU) growth.

ARPU
ARPU increased in 2022 and reflects pricing actions, improved international roaming and customers shifting to higher priced unlimited plans, partially offset by the impact of higher promotional discount amortization (see Note 5).

Churn
The effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins. Postpaid churn and postpaid phone-only churn were higher in 2022 due to a return to pre-pandemic customer behavior, as well as pricing actions and the resulting increase in both voluntary and involuntary disconnects.

Equipment revenue increased in 2022, primarily driven by a higher volume of devices sold and a mix of higher-priced postpaid smartphones.

Operations and support expenses increased in 2022, largely driven by growth in equipment sales and associated expenses, bad debt expense, higher network costs, the elimination of CAF II government credits, and higher HBO Max licensing fees and FirstNet costs. In the first quarter of 2022, we updated our analysis of economic lives of customer relationships and extended the amortization period of Mobility deferred customer contract costs, which decreased expense approximately $150.

Depreciation expense increased in 2022, primarily due to ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion, partially offset by ceasing use of 3G network assets.

Operating income increased in 2022 and 2021. Our Mobility operating income margin was 30.0% in 2022, 29.9% in 2021 and 31.4% in 2020. Our Mobility EBITDA margin was 40.0% in 2022, 40.2% in 2021 and 42.6% in 2020.

Subscriber Relationships
As the wireless industry has matured, with nearly full penetration of smartphones in the U.S. population, future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices that bundle product offerings and take advantage of our 5G wireless network. We believe 5G opens up vast possibilities of connecting sensors, devices, and autonomous things, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). More and more, these devices are performing use cases that require high bandwidth, ultra-reliability and low latency that only 5G and edge computing can bring. To support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible.

Service revenues decreased in 2022, driven by lower demand for legacy voice and data services and product simplification. Also contributing to the decline was lower revenues from the government sector. We expect these trends to continue. Partially offsetting revenue declines was growth in connectivity services and revenues of approximately $200 from intellectual property sales in 2022.

Equipment revenues decreased in 2022, driven by declines in legacy and non-core services which we expect to continue.

Operations and support expenses decreased in 2022, primarily due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies in our network operations through automation, reductions in customer support expenses through digitization and proactive rationalization of low profit margin products, and lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives. Expense declines were also driven by credits from a third-quarter 2022 retirement benefit plan change and lower amortization of deferred fulfillment costs, including our first-quarter 2022 updates to the estimated economic lives of subscribers, which decreased expense approximately $115 in 2022. The declines were partially offset by higher wholesale access network costs. As part of our transformation activities, we expect continued operations and support expense improvements into 2023 as we further size our operations in alignment with the strategic direction of the business.

Depreciation expense increased in 2022, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades and expansion, partially offset by updates to extend the estimated lives of our fiber assets (see Note 7).

Operating income decreased in 2022 and 2021. Our Business Wireline operating income margin was 14.4% in 2022, 16.8% in 2021 and 19.1% in 2020. Our Business Wireline EBITDA margin was 38.0% in 2022, 38.5% in 2021 and 39.9% in 2020.

Broadband revenues increased in 2022, driven by an increase in fiber customers, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future as we invest further in building our fiber footprint, partially offset by declines in copper-based broadband services.

Legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2022, reflecting the continued decline in the number of customers, which we expect to continue.

Other service and equipment revenues decreased in 2022, reflecting the continued decline in the number of VoIP customers, which we expect to continue.

Operations and support expenses decreased in 2022, primarily driven by lower network and customer support costs, credits from a third-quarter 2022 retirement benefit plan change and lower HBO Max licensing fees. Also contributing to the decline was lower amortization of deferred fulfillment costs, including our first-quarter 2022 updates to the estimated economic lives of broadband/fiber subscribers, which decreased expenses approximately $130 in 2022. These declines were partially offset by the elimination of CAF II government credits, higher bad debt expense and advertising costs.
Depreciation expense increased in 2022, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades and expansion, partially offset by updates to the estimated lives of our fiber assets (see Note 7).

Operating income increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021. Our Consumer Wireline operating income margin was 10.4% in 2022, 7.9% in 2021 and 11.9% in 2020. Our Consumer Wireline EBITDA margin was 35.3% in 2022, 32.6% in 2021 and 35.5% in 2020.

Service revenues increased in 2022, reflecting growth in wholesale services, subscribers and ARPU.

Equipment revenues increased in 2022, due to higher equipment sales.

Operations and support expenses increased in 2022, due to higher acquisition costs, bad debt and network expenses. Approximately 5% of Mexico expenses are U.S. dollar-based, with the remainder in the local currency.

Depreciation expense increased in 2022, reflecting higher in-service assets.

Operating income improved in 2022 and 2021. Our Mexico operating income margin was (10.4)% in 2022, (18.6)% in 2021 and (22.9)% in 2020. Our Mexico EBITDA margin was 10.6% in 2022, 3.5% in 2021 and (2.9)% in 2020.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS
2023 Revenue Trends We expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and our fiber network expansion. We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network.

As we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services.

2023 Expense Trends We expect the spending required to support growth initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G to pressure expense trends in 2023. To the extent customers further upgrade their handsets in 2023, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs. During 2023, we will also continue to prioritize efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality and “smart” technologies. The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years.

We continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. Cost savings and asset sales align with our focus on debt reduction.

Market Conditions The U.S. stock market experienced volatility and contraction in 2022. Several factors, including the continued impact from the global pandemic, have resulted in changes in demand in business communication services. The global pandemic has caused, and could again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products, as well as continued tight labor market and actual or perceived inflation. Most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. However, we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2023 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.

Included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2023. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in “Other income (expense) – net.” Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2023 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”).

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW
AT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. AT&T subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided.

In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, over the ensuing two decades, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.

Internet The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. However, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the FCC. Suits were filed concerning such laws in California and Vermont. The California suit was dismissed without prejudice on May 4, 2022, and the California statute is now in effect. The litigation challenging the Vermont statute has been stayed pending the Second Circuit’s disposition of an appeal by the State of New York of an order enjoining enforcement of a New York statute regulating broadband rates on the ground that such statute is preempted by federal law. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements in the future.

On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates $65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas. NTIA established initial requirements for this program in May 2022 and is expected to announce state grant allocations in 2023. The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program (established in December 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. AT&T is a participating provider in the ACP program and will consider participating in the deployment program where appropriate. The IIJA includes various provisions that have resulted in FCC proceedings regarding ACP program administration and consumer protection, reform of the existing universal support program, and broadband labeling and equal access.

Privacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data.

Wireless Industry-wide network densification and 5G technology expansion efforts, which are needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment. This increases the importance of local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment in the public right-of-way on reasonable timelines and terms. The FCC has adopted multiple Orders streamlining federal, state, and local wireless structure review processes that had the tendency to delay and impede deployment of small cell and related infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services. During 2020-2021, we have also deployed 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum on macro towers. Executing on the recent spectrum purchase, we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5G on C-band spectrum in 2022 and beyond.

EXPECTED GROWTH AREAS
Over the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on an integrated telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2023, our key initiatives include:
•Continuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of 5G service, including to underpenetrated markets.
•Improving fiber penetration, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues.
•Continuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification.

Wireless We expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation converged services that combine technologies and services. As of December 31, 2022, we served 239 million wireless subscribers in North America, with more than 217 million in the United States.

Our LTE technology covers over 441 million people in North America, and in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 337 million people. We also provide 4G coverage using another technology (HSPA+), and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. In December 2018, we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5G service and expanded that deployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31, 2022, our network covers more than 285 million people with 5G technology in the United States and North America.

Our networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies’ networks. We believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31, 2022, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million people in Mexico.

Integration of Data and Broadband Services As the communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of blending wireline and wireless services, we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and provide broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service. In January 2022, we launched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to AT&T Fiber customers with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers. We will continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Set forth below is a summary of the most significant regulatory proceedings that directly affected our operations during 2022. Industry-wide regulatory developments are discussed above in Operating Environment Overview. While these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words “we,” “AT&T” and “our” are used to simplify the discussion. The following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues.

International Regulation Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) services globally and wireless services in Mexico.

The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in May of 2018. AT&T processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees. This regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance.

Federal Regulation We have organized our following discussion by service impacted.

Internet The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. The D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC’s current classification, although it remanded three discrete issues to the FCC for further consideration. These issues related to the effect of the FCC’s decision to classify broadband services as

29

AT&T Inc.
Dollars in millions except per share amounts

information services on public safety, the regulation of pole attachments, and universal service support for low-income consumers through the Lifeline program. Because no party sought Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit’s decision to uphold the FCC’s classification of broadband as an information service, that decision is final.

In October 2020, the FCC adopted an order addressing the three issues remanded by the D.C. Circuit for further consideration. After considering those issues, the FCC concluded there were no grounds to depart from its determination that fixed and mobile consumer broadband services should be classified as information services. An appeal of the FCC’s remand decision is pending.

Some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the FCC. Suits were filed concerning such laws in California and Vermont. The California suit was dismissed without prejudice on May 4, 2022, and the California statute is now in effect. The litigation challenging the Vermont statute has been stayed pending the Second Circuit’s disposition of an appeal by the State of New York of an order enjoining enforcement of a New York statute regulating broadband rates on the ground that such statute is preempted by federal law. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements in the future.

On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the IIJA into law. The legislation appropriates funds to support broadband deployment and adoption. The NTIA is responsible for distributing the majority of these funds primarily through state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas, and to a lesser extent for middle mile broadband infrastructure, and digital equity programs. On May 13, 2022, NTIA issued three Notices of Funding Opportunity for these initiatives – the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, the Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program, and the State Digital Equity Program. NTIA will continue to administer and implement these programs. The IIJA also appropriated funds for establishment of the ACP, an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program. Qualifying customers can receive reimbursements to assist with their internet bill. AT&T is a participating provider in the ACP program and will consider participating in the deployment program where appropriate. The IIJA includes various provisions that have resulted in FCC proceedings regarding ACP program administration and consumer protection, reform of the existing universal support program, and broadband labeling and equal access.

Privacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data.

Wireless and Broadband In June and November 2020, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities. Appeals of the November 2020 order remain pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, following multiple requests by the FCC to hold the appeal in abeyance until the Senate confirms a fifth FCC Commissioner. If sustained on appeal, these FCC decisions will remove state and local regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5G and FirstNet deployments, which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles, expand existing facilities to accommodate public safety services, and replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services. During 2022, we have also deployed 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum on macro towers. Executing on the recent spectrum purchase, we continued deploying 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum.

In March 2020, the FCC released its order setting rules for certain spectrum bands (C-band) for 5G operations. In that order, the FCC concluded that C-band 5G services that met the agency’s technical limits on power and emissions would not cause harmful interference with aircraft operations. In reliance on that order, AT&T bid a total of $23,406 and was awarded 1,621 C-band licenses, including 40 MHz available for deployment in December 2021, with the remainder available for deployment no later than December 2023. In late 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) questioned whether the C-band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, which operate on spectrum bands over 400 MHz away from the spectrum AT&T launched in 2022 and 220 MHz away from spectrum AT&T plans to launch in 2023. In response, to allow the FAA more time to evaluate, AT&T and Verizon delayed their planned December 2021 5G C-band launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to a series of temporary, precautionary measures, in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports. These measures have been subsequently modified from time to time. We continue to work with the FAA to reduce the temporary measures with C-band deployments as aircraft equipment is upgraded.

In recent years, the FCC took several actions to make spectrum available for 5G services, including the auction of 280 MHz of mid-band spectrum previously used for satellite service (the “C Band” auction) and 39 GHz band spectrum. AT&T obtained spectrum in these auctions (see “Other Business Matters”). The FCC also made 150 MHz of mid-band CBRS spectrum available, to be shared with Federal incumbents, which enjoy priority. In addition, the FCC recently completed Auction 110, in which AT&T won 40 MHz of 3.45 GHz spectrum nationwide at a cost of $9,079.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted-average assumptions are discussed in Note 14. Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for both pension and postretirement benefits of 5.20%, at December 31, 2022, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index linked. For the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our pension discount rate by 2.20%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $11,738, and increased our postretirement discount rate by 2.40%, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $2,102.

Our expected long-term rate of return was 6.75% on pension plan assets and 4.50% on postretirement plan assets for 2022. We have increased our expected return on plan assets to 7.50% on pension plan assets and 6.50% on postretirement plan assets for 2023, reflecting higher long-term capital market expectations for equities and higher yields for bonds. Our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2023 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $201, which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year upon remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans.

We recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “Other income (expense) – net” in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31, and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years. See Note 14 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions.

Depreciation Our depreciation of assets, including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries and estimates of useful lives, is described in Notes 1 and 7.

If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our plant in service would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $2,653 in our 2022 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3,778 in our 2022 depreciation expense. See Notes 7 and 8 for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property, plant and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use assets.

Asset Valuations and Impairments
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on October 1 for impairment. For impairment testing, we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life. Inputs underlying the expected cash flows include, but are not limited to, subscriber counts, revenue per user, capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber, and ongoing operating costs. We based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results, trends, business plans and marketplace participant data.

Annual Goodwill Testing
Goodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We estimate fair values using an income approach (also known as a discounted cash flow model) and a market multiple approach. The income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units.

As of October 1, 2022, the calculated fair value of the Mobility reporting unit exceeded its book value and no additional testing was necessary. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of Mobility cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 0.5%, the fair value would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill. In

31

--------------------------------------------
AT&T Inc.
Dollars in millions except per share amounts

the event of a 10% drop in the fair value of the Mobility reporting unit, the fair value still would have exceeded the book value of the reporting unit.

Our 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in noncash impairment charges related to our Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units. The decline in fair values was primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, namely increased weighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure and lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines, predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fair values. Future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions, or higher discount rates or declines in the value of AT&T stock could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A summary of business unit goodwill impairment by segment and sensitivity analysis is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------ ------------- -------- ------ ------ ----- - ---
 Communications Latin America
 Business Consumer
 Wireline Wireline Mexico
Goodwill as of October 1, 2022: $ 17,903 $ 30,155 $ 826
Impairment charge (13,478) (10,508) (826)
Remaining Goodwill at December 31, 2022 $ 4,425 $ 19,647 $ —
Sensitivity analysis, approximate hypothetical impairment charge:
Weighted-average cost of capital increase of 25 BP $ 1,200 $ 2,200 $ —
Projected terminal growth rate decline of 25 BP 700 1,400 —
Projected long-term EBITDA margin decline of 100 BP 1,500 1,300 —

U.S. Wireless Licenses
The fair value of U.S. wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model (the Greenfield Approach) and a qualitative corroborative market approach based on auction prices, depending upon auction activity. The Greenfield Approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. These licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the United States. For impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting expected long-term inflation trends. We assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. We used a discount rate of 9.50%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value of the licenses. The fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.

Other Finite-Lived Intangibles
Customer relationships, licenses in Mexico and other finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life. For this analysis, we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its book value. When the asset’s book value exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is recorded to reduce the book value of the asset to its estimated fair value (see Notes 7 and 9).

Income Taxes Our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.

We use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS
Spectrum Auctions On January 14, 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder for 1,624 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $123 in the third quarter of 2021 and paid the remaining $8,956 in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $9,079. We received the licenses in May 2022, and classified the auction deposits and related capitalized interest as “Licenses – Net” on our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet.

On February 24, 2021, the FCC announced that AT&T was the winning bidder for 1,621 C-Band licenses, comprised of a total of 80 MHz nationwide, including 40 MHz in Phase I. We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406. We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as “Licenses – Net” on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. In December 2021, we paid $955 of Incentive Payments for the clearing of Phase I spectrum and estimate that we will be responsible for an additional $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $1,100 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which we paid $650 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $98 in the third quarter of 2022.

WarnerMedia On April 8, 2022, we completed the separation and distribution of our WarnerMedia business, and merger of Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), an AT&T subsidiary formed to hold the WarnerMedia business, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc., which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD). Each AT&T shareholder was entitled to receive 0.241917 shares of WBD common stock for each share of AT&T common stock held as of the record date, which represented approximately 71% of WBD. In connection with and in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), prior to the distribution and merger, AT&T received approximately $40,400, which includes $38,800 of Spinco cash and $1,600 of debt retained by WarnerMedia. During the second quarter of 2022, assets of approximately $121,100 and liabilities of $70,600 were removed from our balance sheet as well as $45,041 of retained earnings and $5,632 of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to Section 1.3 of the SDA, which resulted in a $1,200 payment to WBD in the third quarter of 2022 and was reflected in the December 31, 2022 balance sheet as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The payment is accounted for as cash used in financing activities in our statement of cash flows in third quarter of 2022. (See Note 6)

AT&T, Spinco and Discovery entered into a Tax Matters Agreement, which governs the parties’ rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, the preservation of the expected tax-free status of the transactions contemplated by the SDA, and other matters regarding taxes.

Additionally, we entered into an adjusted HBO Max agreement with WBD that provides us with expanded distribution rights and additional flexibility to market and sell the service in a cost-efficient manner. Under the terms of the agreement, beginning June 1, 2022, we are permitted to include HBO Max in our customer offerings in exchange for a licensing fee. Furthermore, AT&T has the right, but not the obligation, to market and distribute HBO Max to its customers in plans, bundles, and promotional offers.

Xandr On June 6, 2022, we completed the sale of the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation. Xandr was reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations. (See Note 6)

Gigapower, LLC On December 22, 2022, we agreed to form Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower), a joint venture with BlackRock Alternatives, to provide a fiber network to Internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. that serve customers outside of our traditional 21-state wireline footprint. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon closing the joint venture, we expect to deconsolidate Gigapower’s operations.

Labor Contracts As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 160,700 persons. Approximately 42% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contracts included the following:
•A contract covering approximately 7,000 Mobility employees in nine states, for which we reached tentative agreement in February 2023.
•A contract covering approximately 400 employees supporting internet-based products is set to expire in July 2023.
•A contract covering approximately 200 Mobility employees in Illinois is set to expire in May 2023.

Inflation Reduction Act The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on “applicable corporations” for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT is imposed to the extent the alternative minimum tax exceeds a company’s regular tax liability. A corporation that pays alternative minimum tax is eligible for a credit against income tax in future years. Subject to future regulatory guidance, we currently do not believe the CAMT will have a material impact on our 2023 tax liability.

OECD On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework with widespread implementation anticipated by 2024. There can be no assurance that these new rules will not increase our taxes in these countries and have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes, when enacted or enforced by participating countries in which we do business.

Environmental We are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more. However, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

At December 31, 2022 2021
Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,701 $ 19,223
Total debt 135,890 175,631

We had $3,701 in cash and cash equivalents available at December 31, 2022, decreasing $15,522 since December 31, 2021 and returning to historical levels with the close of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $866 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $2,835. Approximately $1,045 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign entities in accounts predominantly outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation.

In 2022, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, cash received in connection with the separation and distribution of the WarnerMedia business, issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt and distributions from DIRECTV. These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses, spectrum acquisitions, funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repayment of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.

Refer to “Contractual Obligations” discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations
During 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $35,812 compared to $37,170 in 2021, reflecting the separation of DIRECTV and working capital impacts, including higher payments for wireless devices tied to accelerated subscriber growth.

We actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost. In addition, for payments to a key supplier, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as supplier financing). The net impact of supplier financing was to improve cash from operating activities $851 in 2022 and $25 in 2021. All supplier financing payments are due within one year.

Cash Used in or Provided by Investing Activities from Continuing Operations
During 2022, cash used in investing activities totaled $26,899, consisting primarily of $19,626 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures, and $10,200 for acquisitions of licenses won in Auction 110 and associated capitalized

interest. In 2022, we received a return of investment of $2,649 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10).

For capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $4,697 in 2022, compared to $4,596 in 2021. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $19,626, and when including $4,697 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $24,323 ($4,182 higher than the prior year).

The vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2022, we placed $5,817 of equipment in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $5,282 in 2021) and approximately $320 of assets related to the FirstNet build (compared to $750 in 2021). Total reimbursements from the government for FirstNet were approximately $260 for 2022 and $865 for 2021.

The amount of our capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. Our capital expenditures and vendor financing payments were elevated in 2022, reflecting strategic investments. In 2023, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be consistent with 2022 levels.

Cash Used in or Provided by Financing Activities from Continuing Operations
In 2022, cash used in financing activities totaled $59,564 and was comprised of debt issuances and repayments, payments of dividends, and vendor financing payments. We also paid approximately $1,211 in cash on the note payable to DIRECTV, with $130 due as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 19).

A tabular summary of our debt activity during 2022 is as follows:

1On April 11, 2022, we issued notices for the redemption in full of all of the outstanding approximately $9,042 aggregate principal amount of various global notes due 2022 to 2026 with coupon rates ranging from 2.625% to 4.450% (Make-Whole Notes). The Make-Whole Notes were redeemed on the redemption dates set forth in the notices of redemption, at “make whole” redemption prices calculated as set forth in the respective redemption notices in the second quarter.
2Includes $7,954 of cash paid toward the $8,822 aggregate principal amount of various notes that were tendered for cash in May 2022. The notes had interest rates ranging between 3.100% and 8.750% and original maturities ranging from 2026 to 2061.
3Includes $287 of principal repayment on a $592 zero coupon note that matured in November 2022. The other $305 was applied to operating cash flows related to interest expense that accreted to the note over its life.

The weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 3.8% as of December 31, 2021. We had $133,207 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2022, which included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc denominated debt that totaled approximately $35,525.

--------------------------------------------
AT&T Inc.
Dollars in millions except per share amounts

At December 31, 2022, we had $7,467 of debt maturing within one year, consisting of $866 of commercial paper borrowings and $6,601 of long-term debt issuances.
During 2022, we paid $4,697 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $4,596 in 2021. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet were $6,147, with $4,592 due within one year (in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”) and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in “Other noncurrent liabilities”).

At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 144 million shares remaining from our share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014. During 2022, we repurchased approximately 34 million shares under the March 2014 authorization.

We paid dividends on common shares and preferred shares of $9,859 in 2022, compared with $15,068 in 2021. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors, on a quarterly basis, totaled $1.11 per share in 2022 and $2.08 per share in 2021. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&T and long-term growth opportunities. On February 1, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expected annual dividend level of $1.11 per common share, or approximately $8,000 per year, following the close of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, all outstanding AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests) were put to us (approximately $8,000), with approximately one-third redeemed in the fourth quarter; approximately 107 million interests are expected to be redeemed primarily in October 2023 and 107 million redeemed in October 2024, per the terms of the agreement, unless the interests are called or the puts are accepted by AT&T prior to those dates. With the certainty of redemption, the remaining Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current as “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and $2,670 recorded in “Other noncurrent liabilities.” In the fourth quarter of 2022, we paid approximately $2,600 cash to redeem the Mobility preferred interests put to us on October 24, 2022. (See Note 16)
Our 2023 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt, and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.
Credit Facilities
The following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. In November 2022, we terminated one of our revolving credit agreements and amended and restated the other. We currently have one $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2027 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

On January 29, 2021, we entered into a $14,700 Term Loan Credit Agreement (2021 Syndicated Term Loan), with Bank of America, N.A., as agent. On March 23, 2021, we borrowed $7,350 under the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan and the remaining $7,350 of lenders’ commitments were terminated. In the first quarter of 2022, the maturity date of the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan was extended to December 31, 2022. On April 13, 2022, the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan was paid off and terminated.

In March 2021, we entered into and drew on a $2,000 term loan credit agreement (BAML Bilateral Term Loan) consisting of (i) a $1,000 facility originally due December 31, 2021 (BAML Tranche A Facility) and subsequently extended to December 31, 2022 in the fourth quarter of 2021, and (ii) a $1,000 facility due December 31, 2022 (BAML Tranche B Facility), with Bank of America, N.A., as agent. On April 13, 2022, the BAML Bilateral Term Loan was paid off and terminated.

In November 2022, we entered into and drew on a $2,500 term loan agreement due February 16, 2025 (2025 Term Loan), with Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as agent. As of December 31, 2022, $2,500 was outstanding under this agreement.

We also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.

Each of our credit and loan agreements contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating. Our Revolving Credit Agreement and 2025 Term Loan include a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. Other loan agreements include a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter

36

--------------------------------------------
AT&T Inc.
Dollars in millions except per share amounts

through June 30, 2023 a ratio of not more than 4.0-to-1, and a ratio of not more than 3.5-to-1 for any fiscal quarter thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.

Collateral Arrangements
Most of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our approximately $38,800 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2022, we posted approximately $760 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)

Other
Our total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year) and stockholders’ equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2022, our debt ratio was 56.1%, compared to 48.9% at December 31, 2021 and 46.4% at December 31, 2020. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.

A significant amount of our cash outflows for continuing operations is related to tax items, acquisition of spectrum through FCC auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees:
•Total taxes incurred, collected and remitted by AT&T during 2022 and 2021, were $16,630 and $17,119. These taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees.
•Total domestic spectrum acquired primarily through FCC auctions, including cash, exchanged spectrum and auction deposits was approximately $10,200 in 2022, $25,400 in 2021 and $2,800 in 2020.
•Total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled approximately $3,200 in 2022 and $3,390 in 2021, with $788 paid from plan assets in 2022 compared to $1,163 in 2021. Of those benefits, approximately $2,840 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in 2022 compared to $2,990 in 2021. In addition, in 2022, we prefunded $500 for future benefit payments versus $685 in 2021. We paid $5,854 of pension benefits out of plan assets in 2022 compared to $5,942 in 2021.

Certain items were excluded from this table because the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated, we believe the obligations are immaterial, or the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash. These items include: deferred income tax liability of $57,032 (see Note 13); net postemployment benefit obligations of $8,433 (including current portion); and other noncurrent liabilities of $11,035.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet.

The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The components of lease costs are as follows (in millions): ----------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 380 $ 344 $ 259 Interest 16 15 14 Operating lease cost 1,857 1,540 1,391 Variable lease cost and other, net 363 272 269 Total lease cost $ 2,616 $ 2,171 $ 1,933 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded $1.71 billion impairment loss for operating lease ROU assets as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...
