Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.In November 2022, Aon incurred a non-cash pension settlement charge of $170 million in connection with the purchase of an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans. Aon has separately classified the non-cash pension settlement charge within Other, net on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as an adjustment to reconcile Net income to Cash provided by operating activities for the period ended December 31, 2022. Prior year comparable balances have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Aon incurred insignificant non-cash pension settlement charges of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, which were presented as changes in assets and liabilities held within Pension, other postretirement and other postemployment liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11 “Employee Benefits” for further information regarding the non-cash settlement charges incurred.In prior periods, Cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares were included with Proceeds from issuance of shares, and presented as Issuance of shares for employee benefit plans in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These items are now presented separately and prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Proceeds from issuance of shares was $55 million and $44 million, respectively, and Cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares was $185 million and $193 million, respectively.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices
Asset Description Estimated Useful Life
Software Lesser of the life of an associated license, or 4 to 7 years
Leasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or lease term, not to exceed 10 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 4 to 10 years
Computer equipment 4 to 6 years
Buildings 35 years
Automobiles 6 years

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is allocated to applicable reporting units. Upon disposition of a business entity, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the relative fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it was included. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may initially perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill balance is impaired. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a determination is made that it is not more likely than not that the value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the Company will perform a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Any resulting difference will be a charge to Amortization and impairment of intangible assets in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the determination is made. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.
We classify our intangible assets acquired as either customer-related and contract based, technology, tradenames, or other intangibles. Amortization basis and estimated useful lives by intangible asset type are generally as follows:

Intangible Asset Description Amortization Basis Estimated Useful Life
----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- ---------------------
Customer-related and contract-based In line with underlying cash flows 7 to 20 years
Technology and other Straight-line 5 to 7 years
Tradenames Straight-line 1 to 3 years

Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value. Where the Company has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties, the derivative positions are netted by counterparties and are reported accordingly in other assets or other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period, unless the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow or net investment hedge.
The Company has historically designated the following hedging relationships for certain transactions: (1) a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (“fair value hedge”), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variable-rate asset or liability or forecasted transaction (“cash flow hedge”), and (3) a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment hedge”).
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow, or a net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation must include a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, Aon’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges quarterly or more frequently if facts and circumstances require.
For a derivative designated as a fair value hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For a cash flow hedge that qualifies for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings. For a net investment hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Accumulate Other Comprehensive Income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as part of a hedging relationship (commonly referred to as an “economic hedge”) are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period of change.
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (2) the qualifying criteria are no longer met, or (3) management removes the designation of the hedging relationship.
Foreign Currency
Certain of the Company’s non-U.S. operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency. These operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate their financial statements at the current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in Net foreign currency translation adjustments within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Further, gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency of that entity are included in Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period when the rate change is enacted.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,
future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, taxable income in carry-back years, and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are initially and subsequently measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Only information that is available at the reporting date is considered in the Company’s recognition and measurement analysis, and events or changes in facts and circumstances are accounted for in the period in which the event or change in circumstance occurs.
The Company records penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income taxes in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company releases income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the portfolio approach.
Leases
The Company leases office facilities, equipment, and automobiles under operating and finance leases. The Company’s lease obligations are primarily for the use of office facilities. The Company evaluates if a leasing arrangement exists upon inception of a contract. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified tangible assets for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Identified property, plant, or equipment may include a physically distinct portion of a larger asset, or a portion of an asset that represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset but is not physically distinct. The Company assesses whether a contract implicitly contains the right to control the use of a tangible asset that is not already owned. In addition, the Company subleases certain real estate properties to third parties, which are classified as operating leases.
The Company’s leases expire at various dates and may contain renewal, expansion or termination options. The exercise of lease renewal and expansion options are typically at the Company’s sole discretion and are only included in the determination of the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
ROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company has elected the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for consideration received in a contract as a single lease component. The Company’s lease agreements may include initial direct costs and lease incentives. Initial direct costs are incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained and are included in the measurement of the ROU asset. Payments made to or on behalf of the Company, such as tenant improvement allowances, represent incentives that are considered reductions to the ROU asset and lease expense over the lease term.
The Company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases with an initial term of twelve months or less in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. However, the Company recognized these lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the expense was incurred. The Company applies this accounting policy across all classes of underlying assets.
A portion of the Company’s lease agreements include variable lease payments that are not recorded in the initial measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset balances. For real estate arrangements, base rental payments may be escalated according to annual changes in the CPI or other indices. The escalated rental payments based on the estimated CPI at the lease commencement date are included within minimum rental payments; however, changes in CPI are considered variable in nature and are recognized as variable lease costs in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Additionally, real estate lease agreements may include other variable payments related to operating expenses charged by the landlord based on actual expenditures. Information technology equipment agreements may include variable payments based on usage of the equipment. These expenses are also recognized as variable lease costs in the period in which the expense is incurred.
The Company utilizes discount rates to determine the present value of the lease payments based on information available at the commencement date of the lease. As the rate implicit in each lease is not typically readily available, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on factors such as the lease term and the economic environment where the lease exists to determine the appropriate present value of future lease payments. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the rate of interest it would pay on a secured borrowing in an amount equal to the lease payments for the underlying asset under similar terms.
Operating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, Other current liabilities, and Non-current operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities, and Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Aon plc and those entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. To determine if Aon holds a controlling financial interest in an entity, the Company first evaluates if it is required to apply the variable interest model to the entity, otherwise, the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. When Aon holds rights that give it the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses, the Company has a controlling financial interest in that VIE. The Company does not hold a controlling financial interest over any VIEs that significantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and the Company does not have rights to any significant benefits or obligations to absorb potentially significant losses. Thus, the Company does not consolidate any VIEs and Aon’s interest in VIEs as of December 31, 2022 was insignificant.
Aon holds a controlling financial interest in entities that are not VIEs when it, directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights and the noncontrolling interest holders do not hold substantive participating rights.
New Accounting Pronouncements
All issued, but not yet effective, guidance has been deemed not applicable or not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income before income taxes shown above is based on the location of the business unit to which such earnings are attributable for tax purposes. In addition, because the earnings shown above may, in some cases, be subject to taxation in more than one country, the income tax provision shown above as Ireland, U.K., U.S. or Other may not correspond to the geographic attribution of the earnings.
The Company performs a reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on its domicile and statutory rate at each reporting period. The reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on the Irish statutory corporate tax rate of 25% to the provisions reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows:

Effective tax rate 16.2% 32.3% 18.2%

(1)The Company determines the adjustment for taxes on international operations based on the difference between the statutory tax rate applicable to earnings in each foreign jurisdiction and the enacted rate of 25.0%, 25.0% and 25.0% at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit to the Company’s effective income tax rate from taxes on international operations relates to benefits from lower-taxed global operations, primarily due to the use of global funding structures and the tax holiday in Singapore.
(2)In July 2020, final U.S. tax regulations were issued regarding the GILTI high tax election, allowing taxpayers to exclude from GILTI the income of a Controlled Foreign Corporation that incurs a foreign tax rate more than 90% of the top U.S. corporate tax rate. A GILTI high tax election may be made on an annual basis, and taxpayers may choose to apply the election to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company expects to make the GILTI high-tax election for 2022 and therefore recorded the impact of making the election.
(3)Excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment transactions are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company has elected to account for GILTI in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):

As of December 31 2022 2021
------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----- ----- - -----
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss, capital loss, interest, and tax credit carryforwards $ 952 $ 581
Lease liabilities 178 207

Unrealized foreign exchange gains (23) (22)
Other (42) (32)
Total $ (679) $ (714)
Net deferred tax asset $ 725 $ 365

Deferred income taxes (assets and liabilities have been netted by jurisdiction) have been classified in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows (in millions):

As of December 31 2022 2021
-------------------------------------- ---- ----- - ---
Deferred tax assets — non-current $ 824 $ 766
Deferred tax liabilities — non-current (99) (401)
Net deferred tax asset $ 725 $ 365

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances have been established primarily with regard to the tax benefits of certain tax credits and net operating losses, capital losses, and interest carryforwards. Valuation allowances increased by $45 million as of December 31, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021. The change is primarily attributable to an increase in valuation allowances related to net operating losses and foreign tax credits.
The Company generally intends to limit distributions from foreign subsidiaries in excess of U.S. tax earnings and profits (except where distributions would be limited by available cash) and to limit repatriations from certain other jurisdictions that would otherwise generate a U.S. tax liability. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $38 million for local country income taxes, withholding taxes and state income taxes on those undistributed earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis differences is not practicable.
The Company had the following carryforwards (in millions):

As of December 31 2022 2021
---------------------------------------- ---- ----- - -----
U.K.
Operating loss carryforwards $ 608 $ 41
Capital loss carryforwards $ 533 $ 573
U.S.
Federal operating loss carryforwards $ 1 $ 25
Federal capital loss carryforwards $ 112 $ 112
Federal interest carryforwards $ 2,269 $ 1,140
Federal foreign tax credit carryforwards $ 20 $ 18
State operating loss carryforwards $ 473 $ 398
State capital loss carryforwards $ 123 $ 123
State interest carryforwards $ 1,187 $ 551
Other Non-U.S.
Operating loss carryforwards $ 490 $ 301
Capital loss carryforwards $ 8 $ 35
Interest carryforwards $ 26 $ 26
Other carryforwards $ 5 $ 5

The U.K. operating losses and capital losses have an indefinite carryforward period. The federal operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates between 2034 and 2036 while federal operating loss carryforwards generated after this date have indefinite carryforward periods. State net operating losses as of December 31, 2022 have various carryforward periods and will begin to expire in 2023. Federal and state capital losses can be carried forward until 2023. Federal and state interest carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. Foreign tax credits can be carried forward for ten years and will begin to expire in 2028. Operating, capital losses, and other carryforwards in other non-U.S. jurisdictions have various carryforward periods and will begin to expire in 2023. The interest carryforwards in other non-U.S. jurisdictions have an indefinite carryforward period.
During 2012, the Company was granted a tax holiday for the period from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2022, with respect to withholding taxes and certain income derived from services in Singapore. The Company has been granted a new incentive for the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2032. The new incentive provides for a reduced withholding tax rate and a reduced tax rate on certain income derived from services in Singapore, as long as certain conditions are met.
The benefit realized was approximately $115 million, $104 million, and $97 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The impact of this tax holiday on diluted earnings per share was $0.54, $0.46, and $0.42 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The following is a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions (in millions):

 2022 2021
------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ---- - ---
Balance at January 1 $ 347 $ 321
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 35 33
Additions for tax positions of prior years 226 7
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) (4)
Settlements (1) —
Business combinations — —
Lapse of statute of limitations (5) (10)
Foreign currency translation — —
Balance at December 31 $ 601 $ 347

The Company’s liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, includes $535 million, $295 million, and $270 million, respectively, related to amounts that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next twelve months; however, the Company does not expect the change to have a significant impact on its consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes within the next twelve months cannot be made.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its provision for income taxes. The Company accrued potential interest and penalties of $40 million, $22 million, and $21 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded a liability for interest and penalties of $181 million, $142 million, and $120 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2007. Material U.S. state and local income tax jurisdiction examinations have been concluded for years through 2014. The Company has concluded income tax examinations in its primary non-U.S. jurisdictions through 2008.

The benefit obligation decreased primarily as a result of increases in the discount rates in 2022 as compared to 2021. The value of plan assets decreased as a result of negative asset returns, predominately in the U.K, and overall weaker exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The U.K. pension assets are concentrated in fixed income and annuities which were disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising interest rate environment. The U.K. hedging strategy continues to perform as expected and the related pension plans remain over-funded. Net actuarial gains decreased the benefit obligation in 2021 primarily due to the increase in the discount rates.
In November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. The transaction settled $280 million of benefit obligations using $280 million of assets.
In November 2020, the Company entered into an insurance contract that covers a portion of the assets within a select U.K. pension scheme. The transaction resulted in a decrease in Prepaid pension assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income of $94 million.
Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position consist of (in millions):

The Company uses a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for its major pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This estimation was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
In November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. This triggered settlement accounting which required immediate recognition of a portion of the accumulated losses associated with the plan. Consequently, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge of approximately $170 million in 2022.
Transfer payments from certain U.K. pension plans exceeded the plan’s service and interest cost in 2021 and 2020. This triggered settlement accounting which required immediate recognition of a portion of the accumulated losses associated with the plan. Consequently, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge for approximately £3 million in 2021 ($5 million using December 31, 2021 exchange rates), and approximately £2 million in 2020 ($2 million using December 31, 2020 exchange rates).
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:

Expected Return on Plan Assets
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community forecasts, and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target allocations of the plans. The expected return of 5.28% on U.S. plan assets reflects a portfolio that is seeking asset growth through a higher equity allocation while maintaining prudent risk levels. The portfolio contains certain assets that have historically resulted in higher returns, as well as other financial instruments to minimize downside risk.
No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during 2023.
Fair value of plan assets
The Company determined the fair value of plan assets through numerous procedures based on the asset class and available information. Refer to Note 14 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” for a description of the procedures performed to determine the fair value of the plan assets.
The fair values of the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):

Investment Policy and Strategy
The U.S. investment policy, as established by the RPGIC, seeks reasonable asset growth at prudent risk levels within weighted average target allocations. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average targeted allocation for the U.S. plans was 30% for equity investments, 54% for fixed income investments, and 16% for other investments. Aon believes that plan assets are well-diversified and are of appropriate quality. The investment portfolio asset allocation is reviewed quarterly and re-balanced to be within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate by the RPGIC. The investment policies for international plans are generally established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans’ ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate to ensure that the objectives are being met. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average targeted allocation for the U.K. and non-U.S. plans was 6% for equity investments, 86% for fixed income investments, and 8% for other investments.
Cash Flows
Contributions
Based on current assumptions, in 2023, the Company expects to contribute approximately $4 million, $43 million, and $14 million to its significant U.K., U.S., and other major pension plans, respectively.

Share-Based Payment Arrangement [Abstract]
Share-Based Compensation Plans
Years Ended December 31
 2022 2021 2020

Performance share awards 134 189 116
Employee share purchase plans and other (1) 12 56 10
Total share-based compensation expense 397 449 312
Tax benefit 83 87 61
Share-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 314 $ 362 $ 251
(1) 2021 includes expenses related to the Aon United Growth Ownership Plan.
Restricted Share Units
RSUs generally vest between three and five years. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the market value of the Company’s class A ordinary shares at the date of grant. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause the forfeiture of all non-vested awards. Compensation expense associated with RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain RSUs, based on the initial grant amount.
The following table summarizes the status of the Company’s RSUs (shares in thousands, except fair value):

Shares Fair Value (1)
--------------------------------------- -------------- - ---
Non-vested balance at December 31, 2021 3,075 $ 203
Granted 1,117 $ 279
Vested (1,154) $ 187
Forfeited (175) $ 219
Non-vested balance at December 31, 2022 2,863 $ 238

(1)Represents per share weighted average fair value of award at date of grant.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 was $279, $253, and $185, respectively. The fair value of RSUs that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $216 million, $189 million, and $190 million, respectively.
Unamortized deferred compensation expense amounted to $466 million as of December 31, 2022, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of approximately 2.0 years.
Performance Share Awards
The vesting of PSAs is contingent upon meeting a cumulative level of adjusted diluted earnings per share related performance over a three-year period. The actual issuance of shares may range from 0-200% of the target number of PSAs granted, based on the terms of the plan and level of achievement of the related performance target. The grant date fair value of PSAs is based upon the market price of the Company’s class A ordinary shares at the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. The performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest. Management evaluates its estimate of the actual number of shares expected to be issued at the end of the programs on a quarterly basis. The cumulative effect of the change in estimate is recognized in the period of change as an adjustment to Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income, if necessary. Dividend equivalents are not paid on PSAs.
The following table summarizes the status of the Company's PSAs at 100% of the targeted amount (shares in thousands, except fair value):

Shares Fair Value (1)
--------------------------------------- -------------- - ---
Non-vested balance at December 31, 2021 1,298 $ 181
Granted 300 $ 311
Vested (444) $ 163
Forfeited (18) $ 217
Non-vested balance at December 31, 2022 1,136 $ 222

(1)Represents per share weighted average fair value of award at date of grant.

The per share weighted-average grant date fair value of the Company's PSA awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 was $311, $225, and $163, respectively. The payout of shares in 2022 with respect to the PSA awards granted in 2019 based on performance for the three-year performance period ended 2021 was, in aggregate, 888 thousand shares. The fair value of PSAs that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $145 million, $112 million, and $121 million, respectively.

Unamortized compensation expense, based on current performance levels, amounted to $126 million as of December 31, 2022, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of approximately 1.3 years.

The benefit obligation decreased primarily as a result of increases in the discount rates in 2022 as compared to 2021. The value of plan assets decreased as a result of negative asset returns, predominately in the U.K, and overall weaker exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The U.K. pension assets are concentrated in fixed income and annuities which were disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising interest rate environment. The U.K. hedging strategy continues to perform as expected and the related pension plans remain over-funded. Net actuarial gains decreased the benefit obligation in 2021 primarily due to the increase in the discount rates.
In November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. The transaction settled $280 million of benefit obligations using $280 million of assets.
In November 2020, the Company entered into an insurance contract that covers a portion of the assets within a select U.K. pension scheme. The transaction resulted in a decrease in Prepaid pension assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income of $94 million.

The Company uses a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
In November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. This triggered settlement accounting which required immediate recognition of a portion of the accumulated losses associated with the plan. Consequently, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge of approximately $170 million in 2022.
Transfer payments from certain U.K. pension plans exceeded the plan’s Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge for approximately £3 million in 2021 ($5 million using December 31, 2021 exchange rates), and approximately £2 million in 2020 ($2 million using December 31, 2020 exchange rates).
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:

Expected Return on Plan Assets
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community forecasts, and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target allocations of the plans. The expected return of 5.28% on U.S. plan assets reflects a portfolio that is seeking asset growth through a higher equity allocation while maintaining prudent risk levels. The portfolio contains certain assets that have historically resulted in higher returns, as well as other financial instruments to minimize downside risk.
No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during 2023.
Fair value of plan assets
The Company determined the fair value of plan assets through numerous procedures based on the asset class and available information. Refer to Note 14 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” for a description of the procedures performed to determine the fair value of the plan assets.
The fair values of the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):
