The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide material information around events and uncertainties known
to management relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations of Gilead and should therefore be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors) where other material events and uncertainties not otherwise discussed below are disclosed. Certain amounts and percentages herein may not sum or recalculate due to rounding. Additional information related to the comparison of our results of operations between the years 2021 and 2020 is included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Management Overview
Strategy and Outlook
Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to advancing innovative medicines to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases, including HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer. We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.
Since 2019, our strategic ambitions have been to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities for 2023 and beyond, reflecting how we plan to deliver those ambitions, are: (i) maximize near-term revenue growth; (ii) maximize impact of long-active HIV; (iii) expand and deliver on oncology programs; (iv) champion an environment of inclusion and employee growth; and (v) remove barriers to speed in execution.
We plan to provide consistent execution on a portfolio with quality, depth and breadth, including continued growth in our leading HIV portfolio, which is poised to shape the long-acting market following our first lenacapavir approvals, as well as strong commercial performance and clinical momentum for our fast-growing oncology business.
Key Business Updates
During 2022, we continued to advance our portfolio, receiving approvals across various therapeutic areas, indications and geographies. We ended the year with Sunlenca receiving its first approval in the U.S. for heavily-treatment experienced individuals, following the first European market approval by the European Commission (“EC”). This is the first twice-yearly, subcutaneous HIV medicine to be approved. We also continued to broaden therapies available in oncology, receiving approvals for additional indications of Yescarta and Tecartus, and the 2023 approval of Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (“HR+/HER2-”) breast cancer who have received endocrine-based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies in the metastatic setting.
In terms of capital resources, we continued to invest in our business and research and development (“R&D”) pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. We also continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Key Financial Results

------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ------ ------ ---- -
(in millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2022 2021 Change
Total revenues $ 27,281 $ 27,305 — %
Net income attributable to Gilead $ 4,592 $ 6,225 (26) %
Diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead $ 3.64 $ 4.93 (26) %

Total revenues were $27.3 billion in 2022 and remained relatively flat compared to 2021, primarily due to increased sales in HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy, offset by lower sales of Veklury.
Net income attributable to Gilead was $4.6 billion or $3.64 diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead in 2022, compared to $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the following items net of their related tax effect: a partial in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) impairment charge of $2.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to assets we acquired from Immunomedics, Inc. (“Immunomedics”) in 2020, a $406 million charge related to the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration agreement with Everest and higher R&D expenses, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022.

________________________________
See Note 2. Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further disaggregation of revenue by product.
HIV
HIV product sales increased by 5% to $17.2 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to continued higher demand for Biktarvy worldwide and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada in the U.S., channel inventory dynamics and unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Part of our favorable pricing dynamics resulted from shifts in channel mix, and we expect channel mix to remain similar in 2023.

36

Veklury
Veklury product sales decreased by 30% to $3.9 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to lower demand driven by reduced hospitalization rates in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by higher demand in Other International. Sales of Veklury generally reflect COVID-19 related rates and severity of infections and hospitalizations, as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccinations and alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from one period to the next.
HCV
HCV product sales decreased by 4% to $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, fewer patient starts and unfavorable pricing dynamics.
HBV / HDV
HBV and HDV product sales increased by 2% to $988 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to higher demand for Vemlidy and the continued adoption of Hepcludex in Europe.
Cell Therapy
Cell therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 68% to $1.5 billion in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to higher demand for Yescarta in R/R LBCL in the U.S. and Europe, as well as for Tecartus in R/R ALL and mantle cell lymphoma.
Trodelvy
Trodelvy product sales increased by 79% to $680 million in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to the continued adoption in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in the U.S. and Europe.
Other
Other product sales decreased by 8% to $946 million in 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to lower demand for AmBisome and loss of exclusivity for Letairis.
Gross-to-Net Deductions
The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in gross-to-net deductions:

---------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- -- ------ ------ -- -
(in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change
Gross product sales $ 41,564 $ 41,381 — %
Gross-to-net deductions:
Rebates and chargebacks $ 12,622 $ 12,594 — %
Sales returns, discounts and other $ 1,960 $ 1,779 10 %
Total gross-to-net deductions $ 14,582 $ 14,373 1 %
% of gross product sales 35 % 35 %
Net product sales $ 26,982 $ 27,008 — %

Foreign Currency Exchange Impact
We generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures. Of our total product sales, 31% and 29% were generated outside the U.S. in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our total product sales of $608 million in 2022, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2021.

37

Costs and Expenses
The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our costs and expenses:

----------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ------ ----- ------- ---- -
(in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change
Cost of goods sold $ 5,657 $ 6,601 (14) %
Product gross margin 79.0 % 75.6 % 347 bps
Research and development expenses $ 4,977 $ 4,601 8 %
Acquired in-process research and development expenses $ 944 $ 939 1 %
In-process research and development impairment $ 2,700 $ — NM
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 5,673 $ 5,246 8 %

________________________________
NM - Not Meaningful
Product Gross Margin
Product gross margin increased to 79.0% in 2022 as compared to 75.6% in 2021, primarily driven by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher royalty expenses driven by Biktarvy royalties, the reversal of a $175 million litigation reserve in the third quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022, and changes in product mix.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $376 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher clinical development spend related mostly to Trodelvy and the Arcus Biosciences, Inc. (“Arcus”) collaboration, as well as inflationary increases.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development expenses of $944 million in 2022 were primarily related to a $389 million charge associated with our acquisition of MiroBio, a $315 million charge associated with the Dragonfly collaboration, an $82 million charge associated with the Jounce collaboration and acquisition of GS-1811, and a $60 million charge associated with the MacroGenics collaboration. Acquired in-process research and development expenses of $939 million in 2021 were primarily related to a $625 million charge associated with an option exercised under the Arcus collaboration. See Note 6. Acquisitions and Note 10. Collaborations and Other Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
In-Process Research and Development Impairment
In connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics in 2020, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired IPR&D intangible assets. Approximately $8.8 billion was assigned to IPR&D intangible assets related to Trodelvy for treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer. In March 2022, we received data from the Phase 3 TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in patients with HR+/HER2- mBC who have received prior endocrine therapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors and two to four lines of chemotherapy (“third-line plus patients”). Based on our evaluation of the study results, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we updated our estimate of the fair value of our HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset to $6.1 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our estimate of fair value used a probability weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to the present value. The expected cash flows included cash flows from HR+/HER2- mBC for third-line plus patients and patients in earlier lines of therapy which are the subject of separate clinical studies. Our revised discounted cash flows were lower primarily due to a delay in launch timing for third-line plus patients which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. There were no changes in our plans or assumptions related to our estimated cash flows for patients in the earlier lines of therapy. We determined the revised estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the asset and, as a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.7 billion in In-process research and development impairment on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The remaining balance of the HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset at the time of the assessment related to cash flows from earlier lines of therapy, where we have Phase 3 pivotal studies in development, in addition to the revised cash flows related to the third-line plus patient setting. If future events result in adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining fair value, including the timing of product launches, information on the competitive landscape of treatments in this indication, changes to the probability of technical or regulatory success, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory approval or discount rate, among others, additional impairments may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. No other IPR&D impairment charges were recorded in 2022 or 2021.

38

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $427 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a $406 million charge associated with the termination of the Trodelvy license collaboration agreement with Everest, which had provided Everest with broad commercialization and development rights to Trodelvy in certain Asia territories. We terminated the existing agreement and reacquired the Trodelvy rights in these territories. Other spending increases in 2022 included increased promotional and marketing investing, mostly in Trodelvy and cell therapy, as well as higher corporate activities and inflationary increases, slightly offset by a decrease in donations to the Gilead Foundation in 2022 as compared to 2021.
Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net
The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Interest expense and Other income (expense), net:

--------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ------ ------- --- -
(in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change
Interest expense $ (935) $ (1,001) (7) %
Other income (expense), net $ (581) $ (639) (9) %

Interest expense decreased by $66 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances.
The changes in Other income (expense), net for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily reflects higher interest income due to rising interest rates, partially offset by higher net unrealized losses from equity securities.
Income Taxes
The following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our Income tax expense:

--------------------------------- ---- ------- ---- ---- ------ ------- ----- - - -------
(in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change
Income before income taxes $ 5,814 $ 8,278 $ (2,464)
Income tax expense $ (1,248) $ (2,077) $ 829
Effective tax rate 21.5 % 25.1 % (3.6) %

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a beneficial change in jurisdictional mix of income and lower state taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure that we can adequately and efficiently finance our operations.
Liquidity
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $74 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities:

------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ------- ---- - -------
(in millions) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 9,072 $ 11,384
Investing activities $ (2,466) $ (3,131)
Financing activities $ (6,469) $ (8,877)
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents $ (63) $ (35)

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.1 billion in 2022, compared to $11.4 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the $1.25 billion payment made in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the legal settlement related to bictegravir litigation as well as higher income tax payments made and higher operating expenses in 2022.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion in 2022, compared to $3.1 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable debt and equity securities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and other acquisitions.

39

Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion in 2022, compared to $8.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, we utilized cash for $1.5 billion of debt repayments, $3.7 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases. In 2021, we utilized cash for $4.75 billion of debt repayments, $3.6 billion of dividend payments, and $546 million of common stock repurchases.
Capital Resources
We believe our existing capital resources, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and our revolving credit facility, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements consisted primarily of the repayment of outstanding borrowings, income tax payments, including the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, purchases of inventory, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and milestone and other payments related to our collaborative agreements. See Notes 6. Acquisitions, 10. Collaborations and Other Arrangements, 11. Debt and Credit Facilities, 12. Leases, 13. Commitments and Contingencies and 17. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations, capital expenditure projects and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments during the year that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term cash requirements.
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•the commercial performance of our current and future products;
•the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
•the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
•the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;
•the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;
•debt service requirements;
•future dividends subject to declaration by our Board of Directors;
•the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and
•costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation.
We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements

Critical Accounting Estimates
See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our significant accounting policies and how estimates are involved in the preparation of our financial statements. We believe the following reflect the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Rebates and Chargebacks
Rebates and chargebacks are determined using a complex estimation process and are subject to uncertainty in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. In developing our estimates of rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following:
•product sales, including product mix and pricing;
•historical and estimated payer mix;
•statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;
•historical claims experience and processing time lags;
•estimated patient population;
•known market events or trends;

40

•market research;
•channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and
•other pertinent internal or external information.
The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our rebates and chargebacks accounts, including adjustments made relating to previous years’ sales as a result of changes in estimates:

--------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ----- ------------------------------------ ----- -------- ------ ---------------------- - -------- - -----
(in millions) Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of Year
Year ended December 31, 2022:
Activity related to 2022 sales $ — $ 13,040 $ (9,442) $ 3,598
Activity related to sales prior to 2022 3,915 (418) (3,067) 430
Total $ 3,915 $ 12,622 $ (12,509) $ 4,028
Year ended December 31, 2021:
Activity related to 2021 sales $ — $ 13,211 $ (9,714) $ 3,497
Activity related to sales prior to 2021 4,012 (617) (2,977) 418
Total $ 4,012 $ 12,594 $ (12,691) $ 3,915

Our net product sales in 2022 include the impact of $418 million for changes in rebate and chargeback estimates related to sales prior to 2022. Historically, our actual rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.
Valuation of Intangible Assets
Determining the fair values of intangible assets, whether as part of a business combination or impairment assessment, involves the use of a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value and requires the use of critical estimated inputs, including:
•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•estimates of projected future cash flows, including revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates, which, for example, include significant inputs such as addressable patient population, treatment duration and projected market share;
•the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;
•the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile, representing the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets;
•the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and
•risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to the high rate of failure inherent in the discovery and development of new products; delays that can occur in development, approval and product launch processes; unanticipated decisions made by regulatory agencies; advent of competing products; unexpected changes in U.S. and global financial markets and other unanticipated events and circumstances. If future events result in adverse changes in the critical assumptions used in determining fair value, impairment charges on our intangible assets may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. For example, in 2022, we recognized a $2.7 billion impairment charge related to our HR+/HER2- IPR&D intangible asset related to an expected delay in launch timing which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment.
Legal Contingencies
We are a party to various legal actions. Certain significant matters are described in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Critical inputs to the accruals recorded and disclosures provided in relation to these matters include the probability of a certain outcome of the case, the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable and the amount of potential exposure. These inputs are subject to uncertainty due to changes in the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law, the views of legal counsel and the views of any judges or jury involved in the case. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the settlement related to bictegravir litigation.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Critical inputs in determining our provision for income taxes and related tax balances include forecasts of our future income and expenses, potential tax planning strategies and determination of the probability of certain tax positions being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. These inputs are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in facts and circumstances, economic and political conditions, changes to existing tax laws and new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities. Changes in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers, communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers, and consumers. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. *Publishing and Advertising--Our Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities, including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cl...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...
