ITEM 7.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business. Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, “Xylem,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Xylem Inc. and its subsidiaries.
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Overview
Xylem is a leading global water technology company. We design, manufacture and service highly engineered products and solutions ranging across a wide variety of critical applications in utility, industrial, residential and commercial building services settings. Our broad portfolio of solutions addresses customer needs across the water cycle, from the delivery, measurement and use of drinking water to the collection, test, treatment and analysis of wastewater to the return of water to the environment. Our product and service offerings are organized into three reportable segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide: Water Infrastructure, Applied Water and Measurement & Control Solutions.
•Water Infrastructure serves the water infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas; with filtration, ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment, making the water fit to use; and pumping solutions that move the wastewater and storm water to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment, monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. We also provide sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services. Additionally, our offerings use monitoring and control, smart and connected technologies to allow for remote monitoring of performance and enable products to self-optimize pump operations maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing unplanned downtime and maintenance for our customers. In the Water Infrastructure segment, we provide the majority of our sales directly to customers along with strong applications expertise, while the remaining amount is through distribution partners.
•Applied Water serves the water usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building services markets. In addition, our pumps, heat exchangers and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, circulation for food and beverage processing, as well as boosting systems for agricultural irrigation. In the Applied Water segment, we provide the majority of our sales through long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve, with the remainder going directly to customers.
•Measurement & Control Solutions primarily serves the utility infrastructure solutions and services sector by delivering communications, smart metering, measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery, monitoring and control of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. We also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality, flow and level in clean water, wastewater, and outdoor environments. Additionally, we offer software and services including cloud-based analytics, remote monitoring and data management, leak detection, condition assessment, asset management and pressure monitoring solutions. In the Measurement & Control Solutions segment, we generate our sales through a combination of long-standing relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners as well as direct sales depending on the regional availability of distribution channels and the type of product.

COVID-19 Pandemic Update and Macroeconomic Conditions
The global spread of COVID-19 has curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations.
This section summarizes the most significant impacts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that we have experienced to date, and we have included additional details as applicable throughout other sections of this Annual Report.
Given the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences, it has become more difficult to distinguish specific aspects of our operational and financial performance that are most directly related to the pandemic from those more broadly influenced by ongoing macroeconomic, market and industry dynamics that may be, to varying degrees, related to the pandemic and its consequences.
The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as broader global market supply and demand dynamics, have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, our supply chains. We have experienced, and expect to continue experiencing shortages in the supply of components, including electronics, particularly semiconductors ("chips"), parts and raw materials. To help mitigate the effects of these challenges and increase the resilience of our supply chain, we continue to enhance and augment our risk management activities, including supplier pulsing and redundancy. Additionally, we have and continue to take measures with respect to buffer stock, the use of alternative suppliers and redesign of certain products to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing supply chain, freight and logistics delays and bolster our access to electronics, parts and raw materials.
We have also experienced, and continue to experience, increased inflation, freight, logistics, labor and overhead costs. The Company has taken specific actions to mitigate these inflationary headwinds, including pricing actions to pass cost increases through to customers and productivity efforts, including selective chip allocation, product redesigns, alternate sourcing options, and global procurement efforts. We have also initiated and plan to continue to initiate restructuring actions in 2023 to further optimize our cost structure.
These supply chain issues have also impacted our delivery times to customers. To some extent, our mitigation strategies have alleviated these issues but our lead times continue to be impacted to varying degrees.
If these issues continue, they could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Many of our offices globally remain in a substantially remote work from home or hybrid status, with no material disruption to operations, financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures.
The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, and the pandemic’s ongoing and future impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price remain uncertain and difficult to predict.
Risks related to the impacts of COVID-19 as well as our supply chain are described in further detail under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Company's 2022 Annual Report.
Evoqua Acquisition
On January 23, 2023, Xylem entered into a definitive agreement under which Xylem will acquire Evoqua, a leader in mission-critical water treatment solutions and services, in an all-stock transaction that reflects an implied enterprise value of approximately $7.5 billion. The transaction, which is anticipated to close in mid-2023, is subject to approval by shareholders of Xylem and Evoqua, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Evoqua, a leader in North America water treatment, complements Xylem’s distinctive portfolio of solutions with advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities, a powerful and extensive network of service professionals and access to a number of attractive industrial markets with resilient, recurring revenue streams.
Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures
Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and operating income margins, free cash flow, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue,

Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.
•"organic revenue" and "organic orders" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales or discontinuance of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.
•"constant currency" defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar.

Executive Summary
Xylem reported revenue of $5,522 million for 2022, an increase of $327 million, or 6.3%, from $5,195 million reported in 2021. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $586 million, or 11.3%, during the year. The increase at constant currency was driven by an increase in organic revenue of $595 million reflecting strong organic growth in all end markets as well as across all major geographic regions.
Operating income for 2022 was $622 million, reflecting an increase of $37 million, or 6.3%, compared to $585 million in 2021. Operating margin was 11.3% for both 2022 and 2021. Operating income for 2022 included an increase in special charges of $12 million and an unfavorable impact from increased restructuring and realignment costs of $12 million as compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating income was $672 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 12.2% in 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $611 million with an adjusted operating margin of 11.8% in 2021, an increase of 40 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our productivity, restructuring and other cost saving initiatives, favorable volume and price realization. These impacts were partially offset by cost inflation and increased spending on strategic investments.
Additional financial highlights for 2022 include the following:
•Net income of $355 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, down 16.6% ($516 million or $2.85 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, up 14.5% from 2021)
•Net cash provided by operating activities of $596 million and free cash flow of $388 million, up 18% from 2021
•Orders of $6,257 million, down 0.7% from $6,300 million in 2021 (up 4.0% on an organic basis)
•Dividends paid to shareholders increased 7% in 2022.
2023 Business Outlook
We anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% in 2023, with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 4% to 6%. The following is a summary of our 2022 organic revenue performance and the 2023 organic revenue outlook by end market.
•Utilities revenue increased by approximately 10% for 2022 on an organic basis driven by strength in the U.S. and western Europe, partially offset by weakness in the emerging markets. For 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the high-single-digits. On the clean water side, we expect improvements in chip supply through 2023 allowing for large deal deployments already secured in our backlog. Additionally, we can expect continued momentum for water quality products and increased demand for pipeline assessment services due to aging infrastructure. We expect wastewater utilities to remain focused on mission-critical applications in wastewater. Long-term capital expenditure outlook is strong due to aging infrastructure and the emerging markets’ continued advancement.

41

•Industrial revenue increased by approximately 13% for 2022 on an organic basis driven by strength across all major geographic regions. For 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We expect to see continued robust growth in our dewatering business, driven by mining demand and strategic growth investments. We expect sustained demand in light industrial activity globally.

•In the commercial market, organic revenue in 2022 increased by approximately 12%, led by growth in the U.S and western Europe. For 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the low-single-digit range. We expect sustained demand for energy efficient related projects, particularly in Europe, and continued commercial development in the emerging markets, partially offset by moderation in new construction.

•In the residential market, organic revenue increased by approximately 16% in 2022 driven primarily by strength in the U.S. as well as strength in the emerging markets. This market is primarily driven by replacement revenue serviced through our distribution network. For 2023, we expect a low-single-digit organic revenue decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets.

We will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure, improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers. During 2022, we incurred $15 million and $19 million in restructuring and realignment costs, respectively. We realized approximately $3 million of net savings from our 2022 actions. As a result of our 2022 actions we expect to realize approximately $14 million of incremental net savings in 2023 and beyond. During 2023, we currently expect to incur between $25 million and $35 million in restructuring and realignment costs.
We are strongly positioned to deliver on our 2023 commitments with commercial and operational momentum. We expect resilient demand due to our differentiated solutions addressing long-term secular trends in our largest end markets. Our 2023 commitments are supported by backlog execution, price realization, continued productivity actions to more than offset the impact of persistent inflation and potential headwinds from slowing demand in our most cyclical end markets. Beyond 2023, we remain on track to deliver our longer-term strategic and financial milestones. In addition to our organic 2023 commitments, we expect to successfully integrate the planned merger of Xylem and Evoqua with a closing estimated by mid-2023.

2022 versus 2021
Revenue
Revenue generated for 2022 was $5,522 million, an increase of $327 million, or 6.3%, compared to $5,195 million in 2021. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 11.3% during 2022. The increase at constant currency was driven by an increase in organic revenue of $595 million, reflecting strong organic growth in all end markets as well as across all major geographic regions.
The following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2022:

Water Infrastructure
Water Infrastructure revenue increased $117 million, or 5.2%, to $2,364 million in 2022 (11.8% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2021. Revenue was negatively impacted by $149 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth of $266 million. Organic growth for the year was driven by strength in both the utility and industrial end markets. The utilities end market experienced organic growth of $151 million led by strength in the U.S. driven by strong price realization, solid backlog execution, timing of projects as compared to prior year and continued strength in the construction sector. Western Europe also experienced strong organic growth due to good price realization, coupled with strong demand in utilities' capital spending. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the emerging markets, primarily due to the continued negative impacts from COVID lockdowns in China. The industrial end market had $115 million of organic growth across all major geographic regions, particularly in western Europe due to strong backlog execution and good price realization, and in the emerging markets, driven by mining projects and price realization in both Latin America and Africa.
From an application perspective, organic revenue growth was driven by our transport applications. Transport
experienced $247 million of revenue growth, almost half of which came from the dewatering application. All three of our major geographic regions contributed to the organic revenue growth in transport, led by the U.S. where we continued to experience strong price realization and had strong backlog coming into the year, followed by western Europe, which also experienced strong price realization coupled with strong demand from utility capital projects. We also experienced strong growth in the emerging markets driven by good price realization as well as robust mining demand in our dewatering business, particularity in Latin America and Africa, which more than offset declines in China due to COVID impacts. Organic revenue for the treatment application was $19 million for the year, as revenue growth from strong backlog execution in western Europe and the U.S. was partially offset by declines in emerging markets led by the continued negative COVID impacts on China.
Applied Water
Applied Water revenue increased $154 million, or 9.5%, in 2022 (13.6% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2021. Revenue was negatively impacted by $66 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of $220 million. Organic growth was driven by strength in all three end markets and across all major geographic regions. The organic revenue growth was led by strength in the industrial water application of $103 million, where in the U.S. we benefited from price realization and demand from OEM customers, in western Europe where we had healthy order intake across the sector, and in the emerging markets where we saw market recovery in China, despite continued COVID restrictions. Commercial building services grew $74 million organically during the year, particularly in the U.S. and western Europe, where we benefited from strong price realization and healthy market conditions. The residential building services application had $43 million of organic revenue growth during the period, primarily in the U.S. driven by price realization and healthy market conditions.
Measurement & Control Solutions
Measurement & Control Solutions revenue increased $56 million, or 4.2%, in 2022 (7.5% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2021. Revenue was negatively impacted by $44 million of foreign currency translation during the year, with the change at constant currency driven by an organic growth of $109 million, or 8.2%, and $9 million of reduced revenue related to divestiture impacts during the year. We experienced organic revenue growth across all three major geographic regions and in both of the segment's end markets for the year, driven by $91 million of organic growth in the utility end market, primarily in the U.S. as a result of the easing of electronic component shortage and strong price realization, followed by $18 million in the industrial end market driven by strong backlog execution in our test business.
From an application perspective, organic revenue growth during the year consisted entirely of growth in the water application of $114 million, which was slightly offset by a decline in the energy applications of $5 million. Organic revenue growth in the water application was driven by strength in the U.S. as a result of easing of electronic component shortages and strong price realization. Backlog execution in the emerging markets and strength in our test and pipeline assessment services businesses in western Europe also contributed to the growth. Declines in the energy applications were driven by impacts from electronic component shortages in the U.S. during the first half of the year, more than offsetting modest growth in the second half of the year.

Orders/Backlog
An order represents a legally enforceable, written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer, the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided. An order often takes the form of a customer purchase order or a signed quote from a Xylem business. Orders received during 2022 decreased by $43 million, or 0.7%, to $6,257 million (3.7% increase on a constant currency basis). Order intake was negatively impacted by $279 million of foreign currency translation and $18 million of reduced orders related to divestiture impacts. The increase on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order growth of $254 million, or 4.0%, over the prior year.
The following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during 2022:

(a)Foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar, the largest being the Euro, the British Pound, the Swedish Krona, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the Hungarian Forint.
Water Infrastructure
Water Infrastructure segment orders increased $136 million, or 5.5%, to $2,607 million (12.2% increase on a constant currency basis). Order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $166 million of foreign currency translation. Organic orders increased during the year as strength in the transport applications came primarily from the U.S. where we benefited from strong market demand in water utilities, price realization and timing of large infrastructure projects. Western Europe also contributed to order growth from increased demand in utility capital projects and healthy market conditions. The treatment application saw a slight decrease in orders driven by the emerging markets due to declines in China related to COVID impacts, which more than offset modest growth in the U.S. and western Europe.
Applied Water
Applied Water segment orders decreased $66 million, or 3.5%, to $1,794 million (flat on a constant currency basis). Order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $68 million of foreign currency translation, making organic order growth relatively flat. Weakness in the U.S. from lapping strong demand in the prior year was partially offset by strength in the emerging markets and western Europe as a result of strong project orders and stocking by channel partners.
Measurement & Control Solutions
Measurement & Control Solutions segment orders decreased $113 million, or 5.7%, to $1,856 million (3.5% decrease on a constant currency basis). Order weakness during the year was negatively impacted by $45 million of foreign currency translation and reduced orders related to divestiture impacts of $18 million. The organic order decrease was $50 million, or (2.5)%. The order declines during the year are lapping strong organic order growth of 38% in the prior year. The order weakness for the year was driven by the water application due to the moderation of early orders to mitigate electronic component shortages and longer lead times that drove order growth in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by strength in the energy applications, primarily driven by demand and advanced ordering to address electronic component shortages.

45

Backlog
Backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. Annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. As such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays occur from time to time. Total backlog was $3,605 million at December 31, 2022 and $3,240 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of 11.3%. We anticipate that approximately 55% of our total backlog at December 31, 2022 will be recognized as revenue during 2023.
Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased 30 basis points to 37.7% in 2022 as compared to 38.0% in 2021.The gross margin decline for the year included 730 basis points of negative impacts, driven by 580 basis points of cost inflation, as well as increased spending on strategic investments of 60 basis points and 40 basis points of inventory management costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable impacts of 700 basis points, driven by 470 basis points of price realization and 230 basis points of productivity savings.

Operating expenses $ 1,462 $ 1,390 5.2 %
Expense to revenue ratio 26.5 % 26.8 % (30) bp

Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses
SG&A expenses increased by $48 million (increase of 4.1%) to 22.2% of revenue in 2022, as compared to 22.7% of revenue in 2021. Revenue growth was higher than SG&A increases resulting in a lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. Cost increases were driven by increased investments in strategic growth initiatives of $59 million and inflation of $38 million, partially offset by $48 million of favorable currency impacts.
Research and Development ("R&D") Expenses
R&D expense was $206 million, or 3.7% of revenue, in 2022 which was fairly consistent with the 2021 expense of $204 million, or 3.9% of revenue.
Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges
Restructuring
From time to time, the Company will incur costs related to restructuring actions in order to optimize our cost base and more strategically position itself. Restructuring charges were $15 million in 2022 as compared to $6 million in 2021.
During 2022 we incurred these charges primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our business to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. The charges primarily included the reduction of headcount across all segments.
In response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on June 2, 2020 management committed to a restructuring plan that includes actions across our businesses and functions globally. The plan was designed to support our long-term financial resilience and simplify our operations, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers.
As a result of this action, during 2021, we recognized restructuring charges of $4 million and $2 million in our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments, respectively. These charges included reduction of headcount across both segments. Other less significant restructuring actions taken in 2021 resulted in $3 million of charges during 2021 and are included in the information presented below.

During 2022, we also incurred charges of $1 million within the Measurement & Control Solutions segment, related to actions commenced prior to 2020. During 2021, we recorded a reduction of $3 million within the Measurement & Control Solutions segment, related to actions commenced prior to 2020.
The Water Infrastructure, Applied Water and Measurement & Control Solutions actions commenced in 2022 consist primarily of severance charges. The actions commenced in 2022 are complete.
The Water Infrastructure actions commenced in 2021 consist primarily of severance charges. The actions commenced in 2021 are complete.
As a result of the actions initiated in 2022, we achieved savings of approximately $2 million in 2022 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2023 of approximately $14 million, resulting in $12 million of incremental savings from 2022 actions.

47

Asset Impairment
During 2022, we determined that certain assets, primarily software and customer relationships, within our Measurement & Control Solutions segment were impaired. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment charge of $14 million. Refer to Note 11, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for additional information.
Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA
Operating income was $622 million (operating margin of 11.3%) during 2022, an increase of $37 million, or 6.3%, when compared to operating income of $585 million (operating margin of 11.3%) during the prior year. Operating margin included unfavorable impacts of 40 basis points from increases in special charges and restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin included 1020 basis points of expansion from favorable operating impacts, driven by a 670 basis point increase from price realization, 280 basis points from productivity savings and 70 basis points from favorable volume. Margin expansion was offset by 980 basis points of unfavorable impacts driven by 660 basis points of inflation, 180 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, 40 basis points of inventory management costs and 30 basis points of unfavorable mix. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $672 million (adjusted operating margin of 12.2%) for 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $611 million (adjusted operating margin of 11.8%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $940 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.0%) during 2022, an increase of $50 million, or 5.6%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $890 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1%) during the prior year. The slight decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting adjusted operating margin noted above; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from a year over year reduction in depreciation and amortization expense.

Water Infrastructure
Operating income was $418 million for our Water Infrastructure segment (operating margin of 17.7%) during 2022, an increase of $31 million, or 8.0%, when compared to operating income of $387 million (operating margin of 17.2%) during the prior year, or a total increase of 50 basis points. Operating margin expansion included favorable impacts of 20 basis points from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 940 basis points from favorable operating impacts, driven by 560 basis points of price realization, 270 basis points from productivity savings and 110 basis points of favorable volume. Margin expansion was offset by 910 basis points of unfavorable impacts driven by 560 basis points of inflation, 220 basis points due to increased spending on strategic investments and 70 basis points of unfavorable mix. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $429 million (adjusted operating margin of 18.1%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $399 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.8%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $480 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.3%) during 2022, an increase of $33 million, or 7.4%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $447 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin.

51

Applied Water
Operating income was $258 million for our Applied Water segment (operating margin of 14.6%) during 2022, an increase of $18 million, or 7.5%, when compared to operating income of $240 million (operating margin of 14.9%) during the prior year, or a total decrease of 30 basis points. Operating margin declines included unfavorable impacts of 20 basis points from an increase in restructuring and realignment costs and special charges as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin decline included 1290 basis points of unfavorable operating impacts, driven by 880 basis points of inflation, 110 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, 120 basis points of increased inventory management costs and 40 basis points of unfavorable mix. Margin declines were offset by 1280 basis points from favorable operating impacts, which were driven by 930 basis points of price realization, 340 basis points from productivity savings and 10 basis points from favorable volume. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $271 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.3%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $248 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.4%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $292 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5%) during 2022, an increase of $21 million, or 7.7%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $271 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.8%) during the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the decrease in adjusted operating margin.
Measurement & Control Solutions
Operating income was $2 million for our Measurement & Control Solutions (operating margin of 0.1%) during 2022, a decrease of $10 million, or 83.3%, when compared to operating income of $12 million (operating margin of 0.9%) during the prior year, or a total decrease of 80 basis points. Operating margin declines included unfavorable impacts of 160 basis points from an increase in special charges (asset impairment) and restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Operating margin impacts included 790 basis points from favorable operating impacts consisting of 450 basis points of price realization, 230 basis points from productivity savings and 70 basis points from favorable volume. Favorable impacts were offset by 710 basis points of unfavorable impacts driven by 520 basis points of inflation, 100 basis points of higher performance related incentive costs and 40 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $26 million (adjusted operating margin of 1.9%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $15 million (adjusted operating margin of 1.1%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $167 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.0%) during 2022, an increase of $3 million, or 1.8%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $164 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.3%) during the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from a year over year reduction in depreciation and amortization expense.
Corporate and other
Operating loss for corporate and other increased $2 million, or 3.7%, compared to the prior year. The increase in operating loss for the year was primarily due to higher performance related incentive costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $50 million and $76 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense incurred during 2021 related to our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 that were paid off in October 2021 and interest income related to additional net investment hedges executed in during 2022. See Note 14, "Credit Facilities and Debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt and related interest.
U.K. Pension Settlement Expense
The Company initiated the process for a full buy-out of its largest defined benefit plan in the U.K. in 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company purchased a bulk annuity policy as a plan asset to facilitate the termination and buy-out of the plan. The buy-out was completed in September 2022, at which point the remaining benefit obligations were transferred to the insurer and we were relieved of any further obligation. As a result, we recorded a pension settlement charge of £123 million (approximately $140 million) in the third quarter of 2022, primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses. Refer to Note 15, "Post-retirement Benefit Plans", of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

52

Income Tax Expense
The income tax provision for 2022 was $85 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2% as compared to $84 million at an effective tax rate of 16.3% in 2021. The 2022 effective tax rate differs from that of 2021 primarily due to the impact of higher U.S. domestic pre-tax income in the current period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:

-------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ------ ----- --- - ---
 Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 Change
Operating activities $ 596 $ 538 $ 58
Investing activities (191) (183) (8)
Financing activities (790) (855) 65
Foreign exchange (a) (20) (26) 6
Total $ (405) $ (526) $ 121

(a)The decrease in negative impact of foreign exchange as compared to 2021 is primarily due to strengthening of the Euro partially offset by weakening of the Chinese Yuan.
Sources and Uses of Liquidity
Operating Activities
During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $596 million, compared to $538 million in 2021. The $58 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher customer prepayments, timing of employee benefit payments and lower interest payments. Higher working capital levels, reflecting increased sales, partially offset these items.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $191 million in 2022, compared to $183 million in 2021. This increase in cash used of $8 million was mainly driven by cash paid for investments, the settlement of a currency forward agreement and reduced proceeds from sales of businesses. Cash received from cross-currency swaps and cash investments partially offset the increased outflow.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $790 million in 2022, compared to $855 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease in cash used was mainly driven by lower debt repayments and reduced repurchases of common stock. Higher dividend payments and lower proceeds from employee stock options partially offset these items.
Funding and Liquidity Strategy
Our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets. We continually evaluate aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, strategic investments and dividends.
Historically, we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs. We currently do not expect any significant impact to our capital and financial resources from the COVID-19 pandemic, including our overall liquidity position based on our available cash and cash equivalents and our access to credit facilities and the capital markets, however we continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of the pandemic.
If our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. From time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. Our securities are rated investment grade. A significant change in credit rating could impact our ability to borrow at favorable rates. See Note 14, "Credit Facilities and Debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt and a description of limitations on obtaining additional funding.

53

We monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost-effective basis. In addition, our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required.
Based on our current global cash positions, cash flows from operations and access to the capital markets, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements and service debt and other obligations in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. over the next 12 months. Currently, we have available liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $944 million of cash and $800 million of available credit facilities as disclosed in Note 14, "Credit Facilities and Debt", of our consolidated financial statements.
Risk related to these items are described in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “Item 1A. Risk Factors".
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Idrica, a leader in water data management and analytics, to distribute Idrica’s GoAigua technology globally and take a minority stake in Idrica. Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearance, Xylem expects to fund the investment with cash on hand for approximately €100 million in the first half of 2023.
Contractual Obligations
Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of debt obligations and related interest payments, lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations. Refer Note 14, “Credit Facilities and Debt” and Note 10, “Leases” of the consolidated financial statements for related to these matters.
The Company has future unconditional purchase commitments which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments within the next twelve months for these obligations is $421 million, excluding contracts that can be canceled without penalty.

Credit Facilities & Long-Term Contractual Commitments
See Note 14, "Credit Facilities and Debt" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt.
Non-U.S. Operations
As we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the U.S., we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non-U.S. operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the U.S. and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so. We continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our U.S. operations. As of December 31, 2022, we have provided a deferred tax liability of $5 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on $467 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the U.S. parent as deemed necessary in the future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

54

Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition. Xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for providing those goods and services. For each arrangement with a customer, we identify the contract and the associated performance obligations within the contract, determine the transaction price of that contract, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset. Depending on the nature of the performance obligation, control transfers either at a particular point in time, or over time, which determines the recognition pattern of revenue.
For product sales, other than long-term construction-type contracts, we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time, which is generally when products are shipped. In instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer-specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer-specified objective criteria. We recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers, at the point in time when the risks and rewards, possession, and title have transferred to the customer, which usually occurs at the point of delivery.
Revenue from performance obligations related to services is primarily recognized over time, as the performance obligations are satisfied. In these instances, the customer consumes the benefit of the service as Xylem performs.
Certain businesses also enter into long-term construction-type sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time. In these instances, revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs. We also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer.
For all contracts with customers, we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account, and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration, which may include a right of return, discounts, rebates, penalties and retainage. To estimate variable consideration, we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method, based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to. The method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends. We constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved.
Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.

55

We have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the U.S. parent. We have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the Company currently does not intend to repatriate. The determination of deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Furthermore, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merits of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
We adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional tax expense would result. If a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
Business Combinations. We record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. These assumptions and estimates include a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and, when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the cost to build/recreate certain technology, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also review the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise. We conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach. We estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. In addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in Note 21, “Segment and Geographic Data,” of the consolidated financial statements, or one level below. The fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

56

The risks around impairment of our assets are included in our risk factor disclosures referenced under “Item 1A. Risk Factors".
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values. However, future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so. We determined that no material impairment of the indefinite-lived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2022. However, future indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. We will continue to evaluate indefinite-lived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.
Post-retirement Benefit Plans. Company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions. These major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, years of service and other factors (some of which are disclosed in Note 15, “Post-retirement Benefit Plans,” of the consolidated financial statements). Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straight-line basis only to the extent they exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value or projected benefit obligation, over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants, over the average remaining life expectancy.
Significant Assumptions
Management develops each assumption using relevant Company experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. All assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and are adjusted as necessary. The table below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2022 and 2021.

---------------------------------------- ---- - ----- ---- ---- -- ----- ---- - ---- -

Expected long-term return on plan assets 5.50 % 2.79 % 6.50 % 2.60 %
Rate of future compensation increase NM 2.84 % NM 2.79 %

NM    Not meaningful. The pension benefits for future service for all the U.S. pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases.
We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, the Company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long-term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation, which is detailed in Note 15, “Post-retirement Benefit Plans,” of the consolidated financial statements.
For the recognition of net periodic pension cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years. The use of fair value, rather than a calculated value, could materially affect net periodic pension cost. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2023 is estimated at 5.90%. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by less than $1 million.
The discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and 30 years, developed by the plan’s actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield

57

curve to develop a single-point discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics. Our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective January 1, 2023, is 4.35%. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by less than $1 million.
The rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. Effective January 1, 2023, our expected rate of future compensation is 2.94% for all pension plans. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than $1 million.
The Company initiated the process for a full buy-out of its largest defined benefit plan in the U.K. in 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company purchased a bulk annuity policy as a plan asset to facilitate the termination and buy-out of the plan. The buy-out was completed in September 2022, at which point the remaining benefit obligations were transferred to the insurer and we were relieved of any further obligation. As a result, we recorded a pension settlement charge of £123 million (approximately $140 million), primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses. The settlement also resulted in the recognition of $23 million in net tax benefits. The settlement of the plan did not impact our cash position.
We currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the range of $18 million to $26 million during 2023. Approximately $5 million of contributions are expected to be made in the first quarter.
Funded Status
Funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately $10 million.
Fair Value of Plan Assets
The plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and foreign equity securities, interests in hedge funds, fixed income investments, insurance contracts, and cash and cash equivalents.
A portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in hedge funds which are generally measured at net asset value. However, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. Accordingly, we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. These adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. The adjustment recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for these assets represented less than 1% of total plan assets in each respective year. Asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. We estimate that a 5% change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately $10 million.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

[" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt.
Non-U.S. Operations
As we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere We expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our U.S. operations. As of December 31, 2022, we have provided a deferred tax liability of $5 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on $467 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the U.S. parent as deemed necessary in the future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

54

Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition. Xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for providing those goods and services. For each arrangement with a customer, we identify the contract and the associated performance obligations within the contract, determine the transaction price of that contract, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset. Depending on the nature of the performance obligation, control transfers either at a particular point in time, or over time, which determines the recognition pattern of revenue.
For product sales, other than long-term construction-type contracts, we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time, which is generally when products are shipped. In instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer-specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer-specified objective criteria. We recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers, at the point in time when the risks and rewards, possession, and title have transferred to the customer, which usually occurs at the point of delivery.
Revenue from performance obligations related to services is primarily recognized over time, as the performance obligations are satisfied. In these instances, the customer consumes the benefit of the service as Xylem performs.
Certain businesses has transferred to the customer.
For all contracts with customers, we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved.
Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.

55

We have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated 
 than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
We adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
Business Combinations. We record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach. We estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

Operating income was $418 on strategic investments and 70 basis points of unfavorable mix. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $429 million (adjusted operating margin of 18.1%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $399 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.8%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $480 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.3%) during 2022, an increase of $33 million, or 7.4%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $447 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin.

Applied Water
Operating income was $258 million for our Applied Water segment (operating margin of 14.6%) during 2022, an from productivity savings and 10 basis points from favorable volume. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $271 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.3%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $248 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.4%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $292 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5%) during 2022, an increase of $21 million, or 7.7%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $271 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.8%) during the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors impacting the decrease in adjusted operating margin.
Measurement & Control Solutions
Operating income was $2 million for our Measurement & Control Solutions (operating margin of 0.1%) during 2022, a decrease of $10 million, or 83.3%, when compared to operating income of $12 million (operating margin of 0.9%) during the prior year, or a total decrease of 80 basis points. Operating of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $26 million (adjusted operating margin of 1.9%) during 2022 as compared to adjusted operating income of $15 million (adjusted operating margin of 1.1%) during the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $167 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.0%) during 2022, an increase of $3 million, or 1.8%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $164 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.3%) during the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from a year over year reduction in depreciation and amortization expense.
Corporate and other
Operating loss for corporate and other increased $2 million, or 3.7%, compared to the prior year. The increase in operating loss for the year was primarily due to higher performance related incentive costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $50 million and $76 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense incurred during 2021 related to our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 that were paid off in October 2021 and interest income related to additional net investment hedges executed in during 2022.
