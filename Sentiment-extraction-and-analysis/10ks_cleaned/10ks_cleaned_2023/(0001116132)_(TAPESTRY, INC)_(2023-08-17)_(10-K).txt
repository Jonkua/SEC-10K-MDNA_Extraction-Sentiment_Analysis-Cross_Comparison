INTRODUCTION
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to help provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. MD&A is organized as follows:
•Overview. This section provides a general description of the business and brands as well as the Company’s growth strategy.

OVERVIEW
The fiscal year ended July 1, 2023 was a 52-week period, July 2, 2022 was a 52-week period, and July 3, 2021 was a 53-week period.
Tapestry, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading New York-based house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands. Our global house of brands unites the magic of Coach, kate spade new york and Stuart Weitzman. Each of our brands are unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. We use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry more sustainable, and to build a company that’s equitable, inclusive, and diverse. Individually, our brands are iconic. Together, we can stretch what’s possible.
The Company has three reportable segments:
•Coach - Includes global sales of primarily Coach brand products to customers through Coach operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, sales to wholesale customers and through independent third-party distributors.
•Kate Spade - Includes global sales primarily of kate spade new york brand products to customers through Kate Spade operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, sales to wholesale customers and through independent third-party distributors.
•Stuart Weitzman - Includes global sales of Stuart Weitzman brand products primarily through Stuart Weitzman operated stores, sales to wholesale customers, through e-commerce sites and through independent third-party distributors.
     Each of our brands is unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. Our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel, geographic area or brand.

2025 Growth Strategy
Building on the success of the strategic growth plan from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 (the “Acceleration Program”), in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company introduced the 2025 growth strategy (“futurespeed”), designed to amplify and extend the competitive advantages of its brands, with a focus on four strategic priorities:
•Building Lasting Customer Relationships: The Company’s brands aim to leverage Tapestry’s transformed business model to drive customer lifetime value through a combination of increased customer acquisition, retention and reactivation.
•Fueling Fashion Innovation & Product Excellence: The Company aims to drive sustained growth in core handbags and small leathergoods, while accelerating gains in footwear and lifestyle products.
•Delivering Compelling Omni-Channel Experiences: The Company aims to extend its omni-channel leadership to meet the customer wherever they shop, delivering growth online and in stores.
•Powering Global Growth: The Company aims to support balanced growth across regions, prioritizing North America and China, its largest markets, while capitalizing on opportunities in under-penetrated geographies such as Southeast Asia and Europe.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS
The environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending. Consumer preferences, macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items, with inconsistent patterns across channels and geographies.
We will continue to monitor the below trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands.
Furthermore, refer to Part I, Item 1 - "Business" for additional discussion on our expected store openings and closures within each of our segments. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
Current Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook
During fiscal 2023, the macroeconomic environment remained challenging and volatile. Several organizations that monitor the world’s economy, including the International Monetary Fund, continue to forecast growth in the global economy. Some of these organizations have recently revised the forecast slightly upwards since the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Nevertheless, the updated forecast is still below the historical average, which is reflective of the current volatile environment, including higher than anticipated inflation, tighter monetary and fiscal policies aiming to lower inflation, financial market volatility, and the negative economic impacts due to the crisis in Ukraine. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced in May 2023 that it no longer considered Covid-19 to be a global health emergency. Supply chains have largely recovered, and shipping costs and delivery times are back to pre-pandemic levels.
In fiscal 2023, the U.S. Dollar has appreciated as compared to foreign currencies in regions where we conduct our business. During fiscal 2023, this trend has resulted in adverse impacts to our business as compared to prior year, including, but not limited to, decreased Net sales of $217.5 million, negative impact to gross margin of approximately 90 basis points, and negative impact to operating margin of approximately 120 basis point.
Currency volatility, political instability and potential changes to trade agreements or duty rates may also contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment or adversely impact our business. Since fiscal 2019, the U.S. and China have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country, with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs.
In response to the current environment, the Company continues to take strategic actions considering near-term exigencies and remains committed to maintaining the health of the brands and business.

Covid-19 Pandemic
The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in varying degrees of business disruption for the Company since it began in fiscal 2020 and has impacted all regions around the world, resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national, state, and local authorities. Such disruptions continued during the first half of fiscal 2023, and the Company's results in Greater China were adversely impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Starting in December 2022, certain government restrictions were lifted in the region and business trends have improved. Although the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic during fiscal 2023 has generally been less significant than those experienced in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the Covid-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and potential impacts on our business, operating results and outlook. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Supply Chain and Logistics Challenges
Covid-19 has and may cause disruptions in the Company’s supply chain within our third-party manufacturers and logistics providers. During fiscal 2022, certain of the Company’s third-party manufacturers, primarily located in Vietnam, experienced ongoing and longer-than-expected government mandated restrictions, which resulted in a significant decrease in production capacity for these third-party manufacturers. In response, the Company took deliberate actions such as shifting production to other countries, adjusting its merchandising strategies, where possible, and increasing the use of air freight to expedite delivery. Based on these actions and improved production levels, the Company has and expects that it will continue to be able to meet anticipated levels of demand. The Company has experienced other global logistical challenges, such as delays as a result of port congestion, vessel availability, container shortages for imported products and rising freight costs.
During fiscal 2023, freight costs on inbound shipments have started to moderate and the Company has significantly reduced the use of air freight when compared to fiscal 2022. As a result, during fiscal 2023, the Company incurred lower freight expense of $84.8 million when compared to the prior year, positively impacting gross margin by approximately 140 basis points.
Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”) program
The Company has historically benefited from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”) program. The GSP program expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in additional duties and negatively impacting gross profit.
Crisis in Ukraine
In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, a humanitarian crisis unfolded in Ukraine, which has created significant economic uncertainty in the region. The Company does not have directly operated stores in Russia or Ukraine and has a minimal distributor and wholesale business which was less than 0.1% of the Company’s total Net sales for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the Company paused all wholesale shipments to Russia. The Company's total business in Europe represented less than 5% of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 total Net sales.
Tax Legislation
Over the past year, there has been significant discussion with regards to tax legislation by both the Biden Administration and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by the Biden Administration, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income ("CAMT") and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states also reached agreement to implement the OECD’s reform of international taxation known as Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion ("GloBE") Rules, which broadly mirror the Inflation Reduction Act by imposing a 15% global minimum tax on multinational companies. The CAMT and GloBE are anticipated to be effective beginning in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, respectively. The US Treasury and the OECD continue to seek input and release guidance on the CAMT and GloBE legislation and how the two will interact, so it is unclear at this time what, if any, impact either will have on the Company’s tax rate and financial results. We will continue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available. With respect to the 1% excise tax on net share repurchases, this provision of the Inflation Reduction Act was effective on January 1, 2023 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. This excise tax is recorded in Retained earnings as part of Stockholders' Equity.

Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 70.8% in fiscal 2023 from 69.6% in fiscal 2022.

Refer to "Current Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook" and "Supply Chain and Logistics Challenges" herein, for further information.
The Company includes inbound product-related transportation costs from our service providers within Cost of sales. The Company, similar to some companies, includes certain transportation-related costs due to our distribution network in SG&A expenses rather than in Cost of sales; for this reason, our gross margins may not be comparable to that of entities that include all costs related to their distribution network in Cost of sales.

SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points to 53.1% compared to 51.3% in fiscal 2022. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher information technology costs, increased occupancy costs, and higher marketing spend.

This decrease in operating margin was primarily attributed to a increase of 180 basis points in SG&A as a percentage of sales partially offset by a 120 basis points increase in gross margin.

•Coach Operating Income increased $56.0 million to $1.53 billion in fiscal 2023, resulting in an operating margin increase of 90 basis points to 30.8%, as compared to $1.47 billion and 29.9%, respectively in fiscal 2022. Excluding items affecting comparability, Coach operating income increased $49.3 million to $1.53 billion from $1.48 billion in fiscal 2022; and operating margin increased 70 basis points to 30.8% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 30.1% in fiscal 2022. This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to a 130 basis points increase in gross margin, mainly due to lower freight costs and net pricing improvements, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, and a 60 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly due to higher information technology costs and higher marketing spend, partially offset by a decrease in selling costs.
•Kate Spade Operating Income decreased $42.4 million to $115.0 million in fiscal 2023, resulting in an operating margin decrease of 280 basis points to 8.1%, as compared to 157.4 million and 10.9%, respectively in fiscal 2022. Excluding items affecting comparability, Kate Spade operating income decreased $48.3 million to $115.0 million from $163.3 million in fiscal 2022; and operating margin decreased 320 basis points to 8.1% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 11.3% in fiscal 2022. This decrease in operating margin was primarily attributed to a 350 basis points increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially due to deleverage of expenses on lower net sales. This increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was mainly due to an increase in selling and distribution costs, higher information technology costs and increased occupancy costs, partially offset by a 30 basis points increase in gross margin, mainly due to lower freight costs and favorable geography mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, increased promotional activity and unfavorable channel mix.
•Stuart Weitzman Operating Loss increased $8.5 million to a loss of $6.7 million in fiscal 2023, resulting in an operating margin decrease of 300 basis points to (2.4)%, as compared to operating income of $1.8 million in fiscal 2022 and operating margin of 0.6%. Excluding items affecting comparability, Stuart Weitzman operating loss increased $12.1 million to an operating loss of $6.7 million from operating income of $5.4 million in fiscal 2022; and operating margin decreased 410 basis points to (2.4)% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 1.7% in fiscal 2022. This decrease in operating margin was primarily attributable to a 560 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially due to deleverage of expenses on lower net sales. This increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was mainly due to higher marketing spend, increased compensation costs, higher information technology costs and higher depreciation, partially offset by a 150 basis points increase in gross margin, primarily attributed to net pricing improvements and lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.
•Corporate Operating Loss increased (1.9)% or $8.5 million to $465.8 million in fiscal 2023. Excluding items affecting comparability, Corporate operating loss increased $35.1 million to $465.8 million from $430.7 million in fiscal 2022. This increase in operating loss was attributed to an increase in SG&A expenses primarily due to higher information technology costs, higher professional fees, increased compensation costs and increased occupancy costs.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
There was no loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2023 as compared to $53.7 million in fiscal 2022. This was primarily related to the premiums, amortization and fees associated with the partial tender of the company's 2027 senior notes and 2025 senior notes.
Interest Expense, net
Net interest expense decreased 53.0% or $31.1 million to $27.6 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to $58.7 million in fiscal 2022. This decrease in Interest expense, net was mainly due to the favorable impact of the net investment hedges, lower bond interest expense on senior notes, as well as higher interest income offset by higher interest on the term loan.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense decreased $14.7 million to $1.7 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to an expense of $16.4 million in fiscal 2022. This decrease in other expense was related to a decrease in foreign exchange losses.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 18.1% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 18.2% in fiscal 2022. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 18.1% in fiscal 2022.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income increased $79.7 million to a net income of $936.0 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a net income of $856.3 million in fiscal 2022. Excluding items affecting comparability, net income decreased $0.5 million to $936.0 million in fiscal 2023 from $936.5 million in fiscal 2022.

40

Net Income (Loss) per Share
Net income per diluted share was $3.88 in fiscal 2023 as compared to net income per diluted share of $3.17 in fiscal 2022. Excluding items affecting comparability, net income per diluted share increased $0.41 to $3.88 in fiscal 2023 from $3.47 in fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher net income and a decrease in shares outstanding.

FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021
The comparison of fiscal 2022 to 2021 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but can be referenced in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022, filed on August 18, 2022 within Part II. Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations".

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company’s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. There were no items affecting comparability during fiscal 2023. The reported SG&A expenses, operating income, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2022 reflect certain items, including Acceleration Program costs and debt extinguishment costs. As a supplement to the Company's reported results, these metrics are also reported on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
The Company has historically reported comparable store sales, which reflects sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from e-commerce sites. The Company excludes new stores, including newly acquired locations, from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operation. The Company excludes closed stores from the calculation. Comparable store sales are not adjusted for store expansions. Due to extensive temporary store closures resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, comparable store sales are not reported for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2023 as the Company does not believe this metric is currently meaningful to the readers of its financial statements for this period.
These non-GAAP performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. Management and the Company’s Board utilized these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the uses of Company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. The Company’s internal management reporting excluded these items. In addition, the human resources committee of the Company’s Board uses these non-GAAP measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals.
The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit. Accordingly, certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the Company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects. These effects occur from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year period's currency conversion rate.
We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the Company's business outside the United States and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations. We believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance.
By providing the non-GAAP measures, as a supplement to GAAP information, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
For a detailed discussion on these non-GAAP measures, see Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash Flows - Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------- ------ ----------- --------- ------ --------- ----- - -------
 Fiscal Year Ended
 July 1,2023 July 2,2022 Change
 (millions)
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 975.2 $ 853.2 $ 122.0
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 5.7 (253.6) 259.3
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,035.9) (1,778.1) 742.2
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (8.7) (39.4) 30.7
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (63.7) $ (1,217.9) $ 1,154.2

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased by $63.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of $1.22 billion in fiscal 2022, as discussed below.
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $122.0 million primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $149.9 million and higher net income of $79.7 million, partially offset by lower impact of non-cash adjustments of $107.6 million.
The $149.9 million change in our operating asset and liability balances was primarily driven by:
•Inventories were a source of cash of $49.9 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a use of cash of $311.7 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower in-transits and receipts due to the strategic decision to pull back on receipts as well as normalization of lead times.
•Trade accounts receivable were a source of cash of $44.1 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a use of cash of $96.0 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher wholesale sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.
•Accounts payable were a use of cash of $98.1 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a source of cash of $86.4 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower in-transit inventory and receipts compared to prior year due to the strategic decision to pull back on receipts.
•Accrued liabilities were a use of cash of $93.0 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a use of cash of $16.1 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in accruals for the Annual Incentive Plan, a decrease in accrued freight and duty, partially offset by an increase in accrued interest due to the net investment hedge and the timing of income tax payments.
•Other liabilities were a use of cash of $61.1 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to a use of cash of $9.2 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower long-term transition tax due to timing of payment schedule.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to a use of cash of $253.6 million in fiscal 2022, resulting in a $259.3 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities.
The $5.7 million source of cash in fiscal 2023 is primarily due to proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $148.0 million, settlement of net investment hedge of $41.9 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $184.2 million.
The $253.6 million use of cash in fiscal 2022 is primarily due to purchases of investments of $540.4 million and capital expenditures of $93.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $380.7 million.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.04 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to a use of cash of $1.78 billion in fiscal 2022, resulting in a $742.2 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities.
The $1.04 billion use of cash in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to repurchase of common stock of $703.5 million, dividend payments of $283.3 million as well as taxes paid to net settle share-based awards of $55.6 million.
The $1.78 billion use of cash in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to repurchase of common stock of $1.60 billion, repayment of debt of $900.0 million, payment of dividends of $264.4 million and the payment of debt extinguishment costs of $50.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from debt, net of discount of $998.5 million.

Cash Flows - Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021
The comparison of fiscal 2022 to 2021 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but can be referenced in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022, filed on August 18, 2022 within Part II. Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations".
Working Capital and Capital Expenditures
As of July 1, 2023, in addition to our cash flows from operations, our sources of liquidity and capital resources were comprised of the following:

------------------------------- -------------------- ------- ------------------------ ----- ---------------------------- ------- ------- - -------
 Sources of Liquidity Outstanding Indebtedness Total Available Liquidity(1)
 (millions)
Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 726.1 $ — $ 726.1
Short-term investments(1) 15.4 — 15.4
Revolving Credit Facility(2) 1,250.0 — 1,250.0
Term Loan(2) 468.8 468.8 —
3.050% Senior Notes due 2032(3) 500.0 500.0 —

4.250% Senior Notes due 2025(3) 303.4 303.4 —
Total $ 3,660.3 $ 1,668.8 $ 1,991.5

(1)    As of July 1, 2023, approximately 47.0% of our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments were held outside the United States.
(2)    On May 11, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement whereby Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, other agents party thereto, and a syndicate of banks and financial institutions have made available to the Company a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "$1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility") and an unsecured $500.0 Million Term Loan (the “Term Loan”). Both the $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan (collectively, the “Credit Facilities”) will mature on May 11, 2027. The Company and its subsidiaries must comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum 4.0 to 1.0 ratio of (a) consolidated debt minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $300 million to (b) consolidated EBITDAR.
Borrowings under the $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) for borrowings in U.S. Dollars, either (a) an alternate base rate or (b) a term secured overnight financing rate, (ii) for borrowings in Euros, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, (iii) for borrowings in Pounds Sterling, the Sterling Overnight Index Average Reference Rate and (iv) for borrowings in Japanese Yen, the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the “Pricing Grid”) based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt to (b) consolidated EBITDAR (the “Gross Leverage Ratio”). Additionally, the Company will pay facility fees, calculated at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the Pricing Grid, on the full amount of the $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears, and certain fees with respect to letters of credit that are issued. The $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility may be used to finance the working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (which may include commercial paper backup). There were no outstanding borrowings on the $1.25 Billion Revolving Credit Facility as of July 1, 2023.
The Term Loan includes a two-month delayed draw period from the closing date. On June 14, 2022 the Company drew down on the Term Loan to satisfy the Company’s remaining obligations under the 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan amortizes in an amount equal to 5.00% per annum, with payments made quarterly. As of July 1, 2023, $25.0 million of the Term Loan is included in Current debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (i) an alternate base rate or (ii) a term secured overnight financing rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be adjusted by reference to a pricing grid based on the Gross Leverage Ratio. Additionally, the Company will pay a ticking fee on the undrawn amount of the Term Loan. Refer to Note 12, "Debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments.

43

(3)    In December 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.050% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2032 at 99.705% of par (the "2032 Senior Notes") and completed cash tender offers for $203.4 million and $296.6 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount under its 2027 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes, respectively. In June 2017, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Senior Notes. In March 2015, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes. Furthermore, the indentures for the 2032 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes, and 2025 Senior Notes contain certain covenants limiting the Company’s ability to: (i) create certain liens, (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii) merge, or consolidate or transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. As of July 1, 2023, no known events of default have occurred. Refer to Note 12, "Debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments.
We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. As of July 1, 2023, there were 14 financial institutions participating in the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans, with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 14%. We have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future.
We have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for, among other things, acquisition or integration-related costs, our restructuring initiatives, settlement of a material contingency, or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes.
Management believes that cash flows from operations, access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines, on-hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for fiscal 2023 and beyond. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on future operating performance and cash flow. This future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions, and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.
To improve our working capital efficiency, we make available to certain suppliers a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to a global financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating. We do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the SCF program. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program.
Total capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs were $260.8 million in fiscal 2023 as the Company continues to prioritize investing in digital capabilities. Certain cloud computing implementation costs are recognized within Prepaid expenses and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Seasonality
The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we typically build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season.
Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including weather and macroeconomic events, and pandemics such as Covid-19.
Stock Repurchase Plan
On May 12, 2022, the Company announced the Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of its common stock (the "2022 Share Repurchase Program"). Pursuant to this program, purchases of the Company's common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. Repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares. These shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes. In addition, the Company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time. As of July 1, 2023 the Company had $800 million of additional shares available to be repurchased as authorized under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. Refer to Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," for further information. During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased $700 million worth of shares.

(1)    Interest on outstanding debt includes fixed interest expenses for unsecured notes and variable interest expenses for the term loan. The estimated interest expenses associated with our term loan is based on the current interest rate as of July 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12, "Debt," for further information.
(2)    Mandatory transition tax payments represent our tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the Tax Legislation. Refer to Note 15, "Income Taxes," for further information.
We expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $100.6 million as of July 1, 2023, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. Besides the firm commitments noted above, the above table excludes other amounts included in current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at July 1, 2023 as these items will be paid within one year and certain long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments.
Capri Holdings Limited Acquisition
On August 10, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, Sunrise Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Tapestry, and Capri Holdings Limited. Refer to Note 21, "Subsequent Event," herein for further information.
The Company intends to fund the acquisition through a combination of senior notes, term loans and excess Tapestry cash. Furthermore, on August 10, 2023, the Company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. committed to provide up to $8.0 billion under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility to finance the acquisition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the commitments included in the table above, we have outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees of $37.1 million as of July 1, 2023, primarily serving to collateralize our obligation to third parties for duty, leases, insurance claims and materials used in product manufacturing. These letters of credit expire at various dates through calendar 2028.
We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies," for further information.

45

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Company's financial statements. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. The development and selection of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board.
The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. For more information on the Company's accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which may be at a point of time or over time. Control is transferred when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, including estimation of sale terms that may create variability in the consideration. Revenue subject to variability is constrained to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal in future periods when the contingency that creates variability is resolved.
Retail store and concession shop-in-shop revenues are recognized at the point-of-sale, when the customer obtains physical possession of the products. Digital revenue from sales of products ordered through the Company’s e-commerce sites is recognized upon delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers and includes shipping and handling charges paid by customers. Retail and digital revenues are recorded net of estimated returns, which are estimated by developing an expected value based on historical experience. Payment is due at the point of sale.
The Company recognizes revenue within the wholesale channel at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers, which is generally at the point of shipment of products but may occur upon receipt of the shipment by the customer in certain cases. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer. The Company's historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results.
The Company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the Company's trademarks. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess sales-based royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved.
At July 1, 2023, a 10% change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, markdowns and returns would not have resulted in a material change in the Company's reserves and net sales.
Inventories
The Company holds inventory that is sold through retail and wholesale distribution channels, including e-commerce sites. Substantially all of the Company's inventories are comprised of finished goods, and are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties and are primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis. The Company reserves for inventory, including slow-moving and aged inventory, based on current product demand, expected future demand and historical experience. A decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact the Company's evaluation of its inventory and additional reserves might be required. Estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. At July 1, 2023, a 10% change in the inventory reserve, would not have resulted in material change in inventory and cost of sales.

46

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Upon acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of brands, customer relationships, right-of-use assets and order backlog. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including brand intangible assets, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Estimates of fair value for finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multi-period excess earnings method, respectively, with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
The Company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. Furthermore, this determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which may include projected future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables and recent transactions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge.
The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
Based on the annual assessment in fiscal 2023, the fair values of our Coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. The fair values of the Kate Spade brand reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand as of the fiscal 2023 testing date exceeded their carrying values by approximately 20% and 40%, respectively. Several factors could impact the Kate Spade brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the optimization of the store fleet productivity, the success of international expansion strategies, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the macroeconomic factors, the reception of new collections in all channels, and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business. Given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above, if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2024 from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in an impairment of these assets.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.
In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, in-store capital investments, promotional cadence, the level of advertising and changes in merchandising strategy. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.

47

Share-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes the cost of equity awards to employees and the non-employee Directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair values of share unit awards are based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The grant-date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility and dividend yield. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on the Company's stock. Dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the Company’s stock price. Changes in the assumptions used to determine the Black-Scholes value could result in significant changes in the Black-Scholes value.
For stock options and share unit awards, the Company recognizes share-based compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. The Company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior.
The Company grants performance-based share awards to key executives, the vesting of which is subject to the executive’s continuing employment and the Company's or individual's achievement of certain performance goals. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses actual performance versus the predetermined performance goals, and adjusts the share-based compensation expense to reflect the relative performance achievement. Actual distributed shares are calculated upon conclusion of the service and performance periods, and include dividend equivalent shares. If the performance-based award incorporates a market condition, the grant-date fair value of such award is determined using a pricing model, such as a Monte Carlo Simulation.
A hypothetical 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense would not have a material impact to our fiscal 2023 net income.
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the Provision for income taxes. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operation. The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of deferred tax assets is not expected to be realized. The Company is not permanently reinvested with respect to earnings of a limited number of foreign entities and has recorded the tax consequences of remitting earnings from these entities. The Company is permanently reinvested with respect to all other earnings.
The Company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Although the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable and legally supportable, the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. Tax authorities periodically audit the Company’s income tax returns and the tax authorities may take a contrary position that could result in a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate, in evaluating tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Upon acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of brands, customer relationships, right-of-use assets and order backlog. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including brand intangible assets, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Estimates of fair value for finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and the multi-period excess earnings method, respectively, with consideration of market comparisons as appropriate. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
The Company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis using a quantitative approach. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit']:
