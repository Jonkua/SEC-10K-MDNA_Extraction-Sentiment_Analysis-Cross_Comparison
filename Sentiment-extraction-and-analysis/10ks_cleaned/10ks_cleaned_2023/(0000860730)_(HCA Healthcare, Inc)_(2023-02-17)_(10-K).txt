Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 18, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $8.522 billion in 2022 compared to $8.959 billion in 2021 and $9.232 billion in 2020. The $437 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2022, compared to 2021, was related primarily to a negative change in working capital items of $649 million, mainly from a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decline in net income of $687 million, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, offset by a decline in cash payments for interest and income taxes of $847 million for 2022 compared to 2021. The $273 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2021, compared to 2020, was related to a negative change in working capital items of $1.781 billion, primarily from an increase in accounts receivable, offset by the increase in net income, excluding the non-cash impact of losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and depreciation and amortization. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $1.075 billion for 2021 compared to 2020. During 2020, we deferred $688 million of Social Security taxes as allowed for under the CARES Act. Half of these taxes were paid in January 2022 and the remainder was paid in January 2023. Working capital totaled $3.741 billion at December 31, 2022 and $3.960 billion at December 31, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Cash used in investing activities was $3.389 billion, $2.643 billion and $3.393 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $4.395 billion in 2022, $3.577 billion in 2021 and $2.835 billion in 2020. In response to the risks COVID-19 presented to our business, we reduced certain planned projects and capital expenditures during 2020. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $4.3 billion in 2023. At December 31, 2022, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $4.707 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. We expended $224 million, $1.105 billion and $568 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flows from sales of hospitals and health care entities declined from $2.160 billion for 2021 (primarily related to the proceeds from our sales of five hospitals in Georgia and other health care entity investments) to $1.237 billion of net proceeds for 2022 (primarily related to proceeds from our sales of other health care entities).

Cash used in financing activities totaled $5.656 billion in 2022, $6.655 billion in 2021 and $4.677 billion in 2020. During 2022, we had a net increase of $3.287 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $653 million and paid $7.000 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2021, we had a net increase of $3.255 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $624 million and paid $8.215 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2020, we made net payments of $3.217 billion related to our indebtedness, paid dividends of $153 million and paid $441 million for repurchases of our common stock. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $1.025 billion, $749 million and $626 million, respectively. The increase in distributions in 2022 is related to the sale of a controlling interest in a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization.

We, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws.

During February 2021, January 2022 and January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized $6 billion, $8 billion and $3 billion, respectively, for share repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The February 2021 authorization was completed during 2022, and at December 31, 2022, there was $1.586 billion of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the January 2022 authorization. Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

During 2022, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2023. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($3.535 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $4.445 billion as of January 31, 2023) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets. Effective in January 2023, availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility was increased by $1.500 billion to total $3.500 billion.

Investments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled $473 million and $541 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $147 million and $154 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $75 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.836 billion and $1.813 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $503 million. We estimate that approximately $459 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $38.084 billion and $34.579 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our interest expense was $1.741 billion for 2022 and $1.566 billion for 2021.

During 2022, we issued $6.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due 2027, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3 3/8% senior notes due 2029, (iii) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due 2032, (iv) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4 3/8% senior notes due 2042 and (v) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 4 5/8% senior notes due 2052. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay down our revolving credit facilities, and we redeemed all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due 2023 and all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes due 2023.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

HCA Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of HCA Healthcare, Inc., is the primary obligor under a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes. The senior secured credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). On May 25, 2022, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) announced it had issued an investment grade rating with respect to the issuer credit rating of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries. S&P’s announcement, in conjunction with previously disclosed events, constituted an “Investment Grade Rating Event” or a “Ratings Event,” as applicable, under the terms of the indentures governing HCA Inc.’s outstanding senior secured notes and, as a result, the conditions in the senior secured indentures to permit the permanent release of the subsidiary guarantees and all collateral securing the senior secured notes were met. The subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing our senior secured credit facilities are not affected. Following this release of the subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing the senior secured notes, the subsidiary guarantors deregistered with the SEC. As a result, summarized financial information for HCA Healthcare, Inc., HCA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, and information about the subsidiary guarantees and affiliates whose securities were pledged as collateral will no longer be presented.

All of the senior notes issued by HCA Inc. in 2014 or later continue to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by HCA Healthcare, Inc. The combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and HCA Inc. are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of HCA Healthcare, Inc. As a result, summarized financial information of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and HCA Inc. is not required to be presented under Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. Our insurance subsidiaries held $473 million of investment securities at December 31, 2022. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022, we had unrealized losses of $38 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

Market Risk (continued)

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $4.780 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2022 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $33.304 billion at December 31, 2022 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.7% for 2022 and 4.9% for 2021.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $35.555 billion at December 31, 2022. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $48 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

We are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.

Tax Examinations

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting an examination of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 return for one affiliated partnership at December 31, 2022. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
