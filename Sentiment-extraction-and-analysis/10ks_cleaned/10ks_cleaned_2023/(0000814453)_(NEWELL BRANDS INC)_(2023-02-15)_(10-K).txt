This section should be read along with the relevant portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of the events and items summarized below.

Overview

Newell Brands is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Calphalon, Sistema, Sharpie, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Yankee Candle, Graco, NUK, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Spontex, Coleman, Campingaz, Contigo, Oster, Sunbeam and Mr. Coffee. Newell Brands' beloved brands enhance and brighten consumers lives at home and outside by creating moments of joy, building confidence and providing peace of mind. The Company sells its products in nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in over 40 of these countries, excluding third-party distributors.

Business Strategy

The Company continues to execute on its turnaround strategy of building a global, next generation consumer products company that can unleash the full potential of its brands in a fast-moving omni-channel environment. The strategy, developed in 2019, is designed to:
•Drive sustainable top line growth by focusing on innovation, sharpening brand positioning, strengthening the international businesses, enhancing digital marketing and omni-channel capabilities, and building customer relationships;
•Improve operating margins by driving productivity and overhead savings, while reinvesting in the business;
•Accelerate the cash conversion cycle by focusing on cash efficiency and improving key working capital metrics;
•Strengthen the portfolio by investing in attractive categories that are aligned with its capabilities and strategy and optimizing product mix; and

26

•Strengthen organizational capabilities and employee engagement by building a winning team and focusing the best people on the right things.

The Company is implementing this strategy while addressing key challenges such as shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape; continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility; a softening macro backdrop; significant inflationary and supply chain pressures, and an evolving regulatory landscape.

Continued execution of these strategic imperatives, in combination with new initiatives aimed to build operational excellence, will better position the Company for long-term sustainable growth. One such initiative is Project Ovid, a multi-year, customer centric supply chain initiative to transform the Company's go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., improve customer service levels and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative, which commenced its first phase go-live during the third quarter of 2022 and its second phase go-live in February 2023, is expected to leverage technology to further simplify the organization by harmonizing and automating processes. Project Ovid is designed to optimize the Company’s distribution network by creating a single integrated supply chain from 23 business-unit-centric supply chains. The initiative is intended to reduce administrative complexity, improve inventory and invoicing workflow for our customers and enhance product availability for consumers through omni-channel enablement. This new operating model is also expected to drive efficiencies by better utilizing the Company's transportation and distribution network.

Organizational Structure

The Company’s five primary operating segments are as follows:

------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segment Key Brands Description of Primary Products
Commercial Solutions Mapa, Quickie, Rubbermaid, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, and Spontex Commercial cleaning and maintenance solutions; closet and garage organization; hygiene systems and material handling solutions
Home Appliances Calphalon, Crockpot, Mr. Coffee, Oster and Sunbeam Household products, including kitchen appliances
Home Solutions Ball (1), Calphalon, Chesapeake Bay Candle, FoodSaver, Rubbermaid, Sistema, WoodWick and Yankee Candle Food and home storage products; fresh preserving products; vacuum sealing products; gourmet cookware, bakeware and cutlery and home fragrance products
Learning and Development Aprica, Baby Jogger, Dymo, Elmer’s, EXPO, Graco, Mr. Sketch, NUK, Paper Mate, Parker, Prismacolor, Sharpie, Tigex, Waterman and X-Acto Baby gear and infant care products; writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; activity-based adhesive and cutting products and labeling solutions
Outdoor and Recreation Campingaz, Coleman, Contigo, ExOfficio, and Marmot Products for outdoor and outdoor-related activities

(1) and Ball®, TM of Ball Corporation, used under license.

This structure reflects the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly assesses information for decision-making purposes, including the allocation of resources. The Company also provides general corporate services to its segments which is reported as a non-operating segment, Corporate.

Beginning in January 2023, the Company will combine its previously reported Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances and Home Solutions operating segments into one operating segment, Home and Commercial Solutions. This change by the CODM was driven by the implementation of a new operating model which is intended to drive further simplification and unlock additional efficiencies and synergies within the Company. The Learning and Development and Outdoor and Recreation operating segments will remain as the Company’s other two operating segments. The Company will recast prior period comparable results in its first quarter 2023 reporting to conform to this operating segment change. See Footnote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Recent Developments

Current Macroeconomic Conditions

The Company, which has been impacted in recent years by inflationary and supply chain pressures, labor shortages, and logistical challenges across its businesses, and more recently by the indirect macroeconomic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is also experiencing additional headwinds due to softening global demand and an increased focus by retailers to rebalance inventory levels in light of continued inflationary pressures on consumers. While all of the Company's segments have been negatively impacted to varying degrees by the softening global demand, the Home Appliances and Home Solutions segments have been the most impacted. These collective macroeconomic trends, the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain, are rapidly changing the retail landscape and have impacted the Company’s operating results, cash flows and financial condition in 2022 and are expected to persist into 2023.

To help mitigate the negative impact of these conditions on the operating performance of its businesses, the Company has secured selective pricing increases, accelerated productivity initiatives, optimized advertising and promotion expenses, deployed overhead cost containment efforts, adjusted demand forecasts and supply plans and taken actions designed to improve working capital. The Company will continue to evaluate other opportunities to improve its financial performance both in the short and long term.

Although management has made its best estimates and assumptions based upon current information, actual results could materially differ given the uncertainty of these factors and may require future changes to such estimates and assumptions, including reserves, which may result in future expense or impairment charges.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict

The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While the Company does not expect the conflict to have a material impact on its results of operations, it has experienced shortages in raw materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and commodities due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the conflict, including increased trade barriers and restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. Additionally, if the military conflict escalates beyond its current scope, the Company could be negatively impacted by an economic recession in certain neighboring European countries or globally.

See Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Project Phoenix

In January 2023, the Company announced a restructuring and savings initiative (“Project Phoenix”) that aims to strengthen the Company by leveraging its scale to further reduce complexity by streamlining its operating model and driving operational efficiencies. Project Phoenix is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023. It incorporates a variety of initiatives designed to simplify the organizational structure, streamline the company’s real estate, centralize its supply chain functions, which include manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer service, transition to a unified One Newell go-to-market model in key international geographies, and otherwise reduce overhead costs.

See Risk Factors in Item 1A. and Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

During the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of the Company's annual impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to write-off the remaining $56 million of goodwill for its Home Fragrance reporting unit, in the Home Solutions segment, as the carrying value exceeded its fair value. The Company also recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $270 million to certain tradenames in the Home Fragrance and Food reporting units, in the Home Solutions segment, and the Baby reporting unit, in the Learning and Development segment, as the carrying values for each tradename exceeded their fair values.

See Critical Accounting Estimates and Footnotes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

28

Debt Redemption

On October 19, 2022, the Company redeemed its 3.85% senior notes due April 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100.002% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption. The total consideration was approximately $1.09 billion, and the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $1 million.

 See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

NM — NOT MEANINGFUL

Net sales decreased 11%, as pricing actions by the Company were more than offset by softening global demand, as retailers significantly pulled back on orders in an effort to rebalance inventory, a negative 3% impact to net sales related to the sale of the CH&S business at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and category exits in the Home Appliances and Outdoor and Recreation segments. The net sales performance also reflected the lapping of elevated levels of demand in certain categories during the prior year. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $300 million, or 3%.

Gross profit decreased 16% and gross margin declined to 30.0% as compared with 31.8% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin reflected higher absorption costs associated with a lower sales volume, higher sales promotional activities to reduce elevated inventory levels, as well as significant input cost inflation for commodities, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, which had a negative high-single-digit-percentage impact to costs of products sold. The gross margin decline was partially offset by favorable net pricing and gross productivity. The gross profit decline also reflected the unfavorable impact of the sale of the CH&S business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted gross profit by $105 million, or 3%.

Notable items impacting operating income for 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ --- ---- -- -------- -- --- - ---
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (See Footnote 7) $ 474 $ 60 $ 414
Restructuring (See Footnote 4) and restructuring-related (a) 39 46 (7)

Transactions and other costs (b) 72 37 35

(a)Restructuring-related costs reported in cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for 2022 were $22 million and $2 million, respectively, and primarily relate to facility closures. Restructuring-related costs reported in cost of products sold and SG&A for 2021 were $22 million and $8 million, respectively, and primarily relate to facility closures. Restructuring costs for 2022 and 2021 were $15 million and $16 million, respectively.
(b)Transaction and other costs for 2022 primarily related to completed divestitures, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings, an indirect tax reserve for an international entity and an incremental bad debt reserve for an international customer. Transaction and other costs for 2021 primarily related to completed divestitures and costs associated with certain legal proceedings.

Operating income decreased to $312 million in 2022 as compared to $1.01 billion in 2021. The decline reflects the impact of lower gross profit, partially offset by gross productivity, as well as lower incentive compensation expense, advertising and promotion costs and overhead spending. Operating income was also negatively impacted by higher current year non-cash impairment charges relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames.

Interest expense, net decreased primarily due to lower long-term debt levels during the first half of 2022 and higher interest income. The weighted average interest rates for 2022 and 2021 were approximately 4.3% and 4.7%, respectively. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1 million and $5 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, are related to the Company’s redemption of certain of its senior notes. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other income, net, for 2022 and 2021 include the following items:

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ---- ---- ---- - ---
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021

Foreign exchange losses, net (See Footnotes 10 and 19) $ 47 $ 8

Gain on disposition of businesses, net (See Footnote 2) (136) (4)
Other (gains) losses, net 8 (12)
 $ (81) $ (8)

The income tax benefit for 2022 was $40 million as compared to provision of $138 million in 2021. The effective tax rate for 2022 was (25.5)%, reflecting an increase in discrete tax benefits, as compared to 18.2% for 2021. The year ended December 31, 2022 included discrete benefits of $58 million associated with a change in the Company's indefinite reinvestment assertion regarding certain earnings within its Irish operations, $28 million associated with the reduction in valuation allowance related to the integration of certain Brazilian and Luxembourg operations and $6 million associated with the approval of certain state tax credits, offset by $14 million of income tax expense related to the divestiture of the CH&S business unit. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a discrete benefit of $37 million associated with a reduction in valuation allowance related to the integration of certain Luxembourg operations, $13 million associated with a reduction of in valuation allowance related to the integration of certain U.K. operations and $9 million related to a statute of limitation expiration in France.

See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes, including the inherent uncertainty associated with the Company's position on U.S. Treasury Regulations enacted in 2020.

Operating margin 8.5 % 8.1 %

Notable items impacting operating income comparability:
Impairment of intangible assets (See Footnote 7) — 29 (29)

Commercial Solutions net sales for 2022 decreased 13%, which primarily reflected the sale of the CH&S business at the end of the first quarter of 2022, which unfavorably impacted net sales by approximately 16%, partially offset by growth in the Commercial business unit primarily driven by pricing actions and improved order fulfillment resulting from the easing of supply chain constraints. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $57 million, or 3%.

Operating income for 2022 decreased to $143 million as compared to $159 million in 2021. The decrease in operating results is due to lower gross profit, due to significant input cost inflation, primarily resin, energy and metals, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, as well as the unfavorable impact of the CH&S sale. The decrease in operating results were partially offset by gross productivity, lower compensation expense and the lapping of the prior-year non-cash impairment charge of an indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Home Appliances

-------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ----- ---- --- -------- ----- -------- - ----- ------ -
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change

Notable items impacting operating income (loss) comparability:
Impairment of intangible assets (See Footnote 7) 15 — 15
Indirect tax reserve 23 — 23
Bad debt reserve 8 — 8

NM — NOT MEANINGFUL

Home Appliances net sales for 2022 decreased 20%, which reflects softening global demand, certain category exits and the lapping of elevated levels of demand during the prior year, partially offset by pricing actions. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $26 million, or 2%.

Operating loss for 2022 was $47 million as compared to operating income of $70 million in 2021. The decline in operating results is primarily due to lower gross profit leverage, higher absorption costs associated with lower sales volume, higher sales promotional activities to reduce elevated inventory levels and significant input cost inflation associated with transportation costs and sourced finished goods, partially offset by gross productivity, lower incentive compensation expense and lower advertising and promotion expense. The operating results were also negatively impacted by the non-cash impairment charge related to an indefinite-lived asset, indirect tax reserve related to an international entity and incremental bad debt reserve for an international customer.

Home Solutions

------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ----- ---- ---- -------- ----- -------- - ----- -------
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change
Net sales $ 2,113 $ 2,386 $ (273) (11.4)%

Operating income (loss) (308) 337 (645) NM
Operating margin (14.6) % 14.1 %

Notable items impacting operating income (loss) comparability:
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (See Footnote 7) 429 — 429

Home Solutions net sales for 2022 decreased 11%, reflecting decreases in both the Food and Home Fragrance business units. The Food business unit decline reflects softening global demand and lost distribution in one product line at a key customer, partially offset by pricing actions. The decline in Home Fragrance business unit sales reflects softening global demand, as well as the exit of approximately 43 Yankee Candle retail stores during the year, partially offset by pricing actions. The net sales performance for the segment also reflected the lapping of elevated demand during the prior year. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $50 million, or 2%.

Operating loss for 2022 was $308 million as compared to operating income of $337 million in 2021. The decrease in operating results is primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges in both the Food and Home Fragrance reporting units, lower gross profit leverage, higher absorption costs associated with lower sales volume, higher sales promotional activities to reduce elevated inventory levels and significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily metals and wax, transportation, labor and sourced finished goods. This decrease was partially offset by gross productivity and lower incentive compensation expense.

Learning and Development

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ----- ---- ---- -------- ----- -------- - ------ ------
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change
Net sales $ 2,950 $ 3,028 $ (78) (2.6)%

Operating income 593 600 (7) (1.2)%
Operating margin 20.1 % 19.8 %

Notable items impacting operating income comparability:
Impairment of intangible assets (See Footnote 7) 30 31 (1)

Learning and Development net sales for 2022 decreased 3%, reflecting decreases in both the Writing and Baby business units. The Writing business unit performance reflects logistical constraints and supply chain shortages, particularly in labelling, and softening demand in certain categories in the U.S., partially offset by pricing actions. The Baby business unit performance reflects softening demand in certain categories in the U.S., as the business lapped elevated levels of demand during the prior year, partially offset by pricing actions. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $96 million, or 3%.

Operating income for 2022 decreased to $593 million as compared to $600 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to significant input cost inflation for sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, partially offset by gross productivity and lower compensation costs. The improvement in operating margin primarily reflects net pricing performance.

32

Outdoor and Recreation

---------------- ------------------------ ----- ---- --- -------- ----- -------- - ------ -------
 Years Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change
Net sales $ 1,315 $ 1,484 $ (169) (11.4)%

Operating income 86 90 (4) (4.4)%
Operating margin 6.5 % 6.1 %

Outdoor and Recreation segment net sales for 2022 decreased 11% primarily due to softening U.S. demand and certain category exits, partially offset by pricing actions and improved product availability. The net sales performance for this segment also reflects the lapping of elevated levels of demand in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by $71 million, or 5%.

Operating income for 2022 was $86 million as compared to $90 million in the prior year period. This performance was primarily due to input cost inflation for commodities, sourced finished goods and transportation, and higher advertising and promotional costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending and incentive compensation costs. The improvement in operating margin primarily reflects net pricing performance and the exit from certain low margin product categories.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share - attributable to common shareholders $ 1.45 $ (1.81)

NM — NOT MEANINGFUL

Net sales for 2021 increased 13%, with all segments and major geographic regions showing growth. This growth reflects favorable net pricing (including lower promotion spending with customers), as well as strong demand for the hand protection, garage and outdoor organization, kitchen appliance, fresh preserving, cookware, bakeware, scented candle, baby gear, writing, labeling, and outdoor categories. Net sales growth was negatively impacted by supply chain shortages and logistical challenges which continued into 2022. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by $101 million, or 1%.

Gross profit for 2021 increased 9% and gross profit margin declined to 31.8% as compared with 32.9% in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was driven by gross volume leverage, gross productivity and favorable net pricing, partially offset by significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, which had a negative high-single-digit-percentage impact to costs of products sold. The gross margin decline reflected, in part, a timing lag between inflation and the full impact of responsive pricing actions. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted gross profit by $30 million, or 1%.

Notable items impacting operating income (loss) for 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ -- ---- -- -------- ----- -- - -------
 Years Ended December 31,

Transactions and other costs (b) 37 26 11

(a)Restructuring-related costs reported in cost of products sold and SG&A for 2021 were $22 million and $8 million, respectively, and primarily related to facility closures. Restructuring-related costs for 2020 were $4 million reported in cost of products sold and $19 million reported in SG&A and primarily relate to accelerated depreciation associated with restructuring activities. Restructuring costs for 2021 and 2020 were $16 million and $21 million, respectively.
(b)Transaction and other costs for 2021 and 2020 primarily relate to completed divestitures and costs associated with certain legal proceedings.

Operating income increased to $1.01 billion in 2021 as compared to an operating loss of $629 million in 2020. The operating results in 2020 included $1.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets. The 2021 performance reflected the gross profit performance noted above and cost savings from Yankee Candle retail store closures, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and advertising and promotional costs. The year-over-year comparison of the Company's operating results to the prior year reflects the impact of the most depressed consumption levels resulting from the COVID-19 related lockdowns which occurred in the second quarter of 2020, and the lapping of the improved operating performance in the second half of 2020, as the Company's manufacturing sites and Yankee Candle stores were reopened, other retail stores were reopened, and consumer demand for certain categories returned. In addition, the Company's operating results for 2021 were impacted by the volatility and uncertainty of the direction of demand patterns, as well as inflation and supply chain shortages and logistical challenges which continued into 2022.

Interest expense, net for 2021 decreased primarily due to lower debt levels. The weighted average interest rates for 2021 and 2020 were approximately 4.7% and 4.6%, respectively. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The loss on the extinguishment of debt of $5 million and $20 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, were related to the Company’s tender offer of certain of its senior notes and debt redemptions. See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other (income) expense, net for 2021 and 2020 include the following items:

(Gain) loss on disposition of businesses (See Footnote 2) (4) 9
Other gains, net (12) (1)
 $ (8) $ 78

Income tax provision for 2021 was $138 million as compared to a benefit of $235 million in 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 was 18.2% as compared to 23.5% in 2020. The change in effective tax provision is driven primarily by the impact of goodwill impairment charges in the prior-year, the geographic mix of where income was earned as well as certain taxable income inclusion items in the U.S. based on foreign earnings and certain discrete items. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a net valuation allowance decrease of $27 million, primarily related to net operating losses in the U.K. and Luxembourg, and other miscellaneous changes in the U.S., state and non-U.S. valuation allowances related to ongoing operations.

See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes, including the inherent uncertainty associated with the Company's position on U.S. Treasury Regulations enacted in 2020.

Commercial Solutions net sales for 2021 increased 5% which reflected sales growth in both the Commercial and Connected Home and Security business units. The Commercial business unit performance reflected the impact of favorable net pricing as well as increased demand in the hand protection and garage and outdoor organization categories, partially offset by a decline in demand for consumable washroom products as well as supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. The increase in net sales in the Connected Home and Security business unit was primarily due to higher demand from retail and contractor channels, partially offset by supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. The increase in net sales in the Connected Home and Security business also reflected the lapping of the prior-year impact of lower demand and store closures. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by $12 million, or 1%.

Operating income for 2021 increased to $159 million as compared to operating loss of $89 million in 2020. The improvement in operating results is primarily due to the lapping of prior year non-cash impairment charges of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as gross profit leverage, including the lapping of the prior-year absorption impact associated with the temporary closure of a key Connected Home and Security manufacturing facility in Mexico, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, gross productivity and pricing. The increase in operating income was partially offset by significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor. The operating margin in 2021 was negatively impacted by a timing lag between inflation and the full impact of responsive pricing actions.

Home Appliances net sales for 2021 increased 13%, which reflects net pricing and strong sales growth, primarily in North America and Latin America, partially offset by supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by $11 million, or 1%.

Operating income for 2021 increased to $70 million as compared to operating loss of $238 million in 2020. The improvement in operating results is primarily due to the lapping of prior year non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as gross profit leverage, most notably from North America and Latin America, gross productivity and pricing, partially offset by significant input cost inflation associated with sourced finished goods and transportation, as well as higher labor costs and advertising and promotional costs.

Home Solutions net sales for 2021 increased 12% due to strong sales performance in the Food and Home Fragrance business units. The increase in Food business unit sales reflected the impact of favorable net pricing as well as increased demand across the fresh preserving, and cookware and bakeware categories, partially offset by supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. The increase in Home Fragrance sales was primarily due to increases in the retail channel in the U.S. and Europe, as well as in Yankee Candle retail stores, partially offset by supply chain shortages, logistical constraints and permanent Yankee Candle retail store closures in the prior year. The increase in net sales in the Home Fragrance business also reflected the lapping of the prior-year impact of temporary retail store closures and supply chain disruptions resulting from temporary closure of its key manufacturing facility in Massachusetts, both resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by $33 million, or 1%.

Operating income for 2021 increased to $337 million as compared to operating loss of $4 million in 2020. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the lapping of prior year non-cash impairment charges of goodwill, certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and other assets, gross profit leverage, including the lapping of the prior year absorption impact associated with the temporary closure of a key Home Fragrance manufacturing facility in Massachusetts, gross productivity and pricing. The increase in operating income also reflected savings from Yankee Candle retail store closures and the exiting of its fundraising business in 2020. The increase in operating income was partially offset by significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor. The operating margin in 2021 was negatively impacted by a timing lag between inflation and the full impact of responsive pricing actions.

Learning and Development net sales for 2021 increased 18% primarily due to strong sales performance in the Baby and Writing business units as they lapped the negative prior-year impact of shifting consumer demand, temporary store closures and supply chain disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Baby business unit performance reflected favorable net pricing as well as increased demand in the baby gear and infant care categories, driven in part by government-related stimulus spending in the U.S. The Writing business unit performance reflected favorable net pricing as well as strong demand in the pens, markers, fine writing and labeling categories, driven by return to in-person learning and gradual reopening of more offices, partially offset by previous divestitures and business exits as well as supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by $29 million, or 1%.

Operating income for 2021 increased to $600 million as compared to $364 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the lapping of non-cash impairment charges of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2020, pricing, gross productivity and gross profit leverage, including the prior year absorption impact of certain temporary manufacturing closures,

Outdoor and Recreation segment net sales for 2021 increased 15% primarily due to favorable net pricing and improvement in consumer purchasing patterns for outdoor equipment, partially offset by supply chain shortages and logistical constraints. The increase in net sales also reflected the lapping of the negative prior-year impact of lower demand and temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by $16 million, or 1%.

Operating income for 2021 was $90 million as compared to operating loss of $418 million in the prior year period. This improvement was primarily due to the lapping of prior year non-cash impairment charges of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, gross profit leverage, pricing and gross productivity, partially offset by significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods and transportation. The operating margin in 2021 was negatively impacted by a timing lag between inflation and the full impact of responsive pricing actions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes that its cash generating capability, together with its borrowing capacity and available cash and cash equivalents, provide continued financial viability and adequate liquidity to fund its operations, support its growth platforms, pay down debt and debt maturities as they come due and execute its ongoing business initiatives. The Company regularly assesses its cash requirements and the available sources to fund these needs. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $287 million, of which approximately $241 million was held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The Company believes the extent of the impact of the rapidly changing retail landscape, which reflects an increased focus by retailers to rebalance inventory levels in light of continued inflationary pressures on consumers, as well as supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and uncertainty over the volatility and direction of future demand patterns, on the Company's future sales, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition will continue to be driven by numerous evolving factors the Company cannot accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market. Any such material adverse impacts could result in the Company's inability to satisfy financial maintenance covenants and could limit the ability to make future borrowings under existing debt instruments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Financial Risks, for further information.

The table below summarizes the Company's cash activity for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------ ----- ----- ------------------- ------- ---- ----- ----- ---- - ----- ----- - ------- - -------
 Increase (Decrease)
 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021

Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (174) $ (544) $ 650 $ 370 $ (1,194)

The Company has historically generated the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, customer program payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The change in net cash used in operating activities for 2022 primarily reflects lower operating income and the impact of the Company's adjustment to its supply and demand forecasted purchases in the back half of the year in response to significantly greater than expected pullback in retailer orders, as retailers rebalance inventory in the light of continued inflationary pressures on consumers, which resulted in lower sales volume and unfavorable working capital associated with higher inventory levels. The change also reflected the negative impact of lower accounts receivable sold under the Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement.

The change in net cash provided by operating activities for 2021 reflects inventory build to support forecasted demand, including the impact of significant input cost inflation, supply chain shortages and logistical challenges, as well as higher annual incentive compensation payments, partially offset by benefits from extension of payment terms for goods and services with vendors and higher accounts receivable sold under the Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement in the current year. In addition, this performance reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year, which included lower operating results and favorable working capital performance.

See Capital Resources for further information.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The change in net cash provided by investing activities for 2022 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of CH&S and other property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher capital expenditures, primarily associated with Project Ovid. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The change in net cash used in investing activities for 2021 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The change in net cash used in financing activities for 2022 was primarily due to the period-over-period change in debt, offset by repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock in the current year.

The change in net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2020 and payments of long-term debt in 2021 as well as the acquisition of noncontrolling interests.

See Footnotes 1,9 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Capital Resources

On October 19, 2022, the Company redeemed its 3.85% senior notes due April 2023 (the “April 2023 Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 100.002% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption. The total consideration was approximately $1.09 billion, and the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $1 million.

On September 14, 2022, the Company completed a registered public offering of $500 million principal amount of 6.375% senior notes that mature in September 2027 (the “September 2027 Notes”) and $500 million principal amount of 6.625% senior notes that mature in September 2029 (the “September 2029 Notes”). The Company received proceeds of approximately $989 million, net of

38

fees and expenses paid. The September 2027 Notes and the September 2029 Notes are subject to similar restrictive and financial covenants as the Company's existing senior notes, however, they are not subject to the interest rate adjustment or coupon step up provisions of certain other notes described below. The September 2027 Notes and the September 2029 Notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company (i) at any time prior to three months before the stated maturity dates at a redemption price equal to or greater of (a) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis, plus the applicable make-whole amount of 50 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date; or (ii) at any time on or after three months prior to respective maturity dates, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption dates. The Company used the net proceeds from the September 2027 and September 2029 Notes, together with available cash, to redeem the April 2023 Notes during the fourth quarter of 2022.

On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Revolver”) that matures in August 2027. The Credit Revolver refinanced the Company’s previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in December 2023.

Under the Credit Revolver, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Credit Revolver provides committed back-up liquidity for the issuance of commercial paper, in each case, to the extent there is sufficient availability for borrowing under the Credit Revolver. At December 31, 2022, the Company has $225 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Revolver and $359 million in commercial paper borrowings.

The Credit Revolver provides for the issuance of up to $150 million of letters of credit, so long as there is sufficient availability for borrowing under the Credit Revolver. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $22 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued against the Credit Revolver, with a net availability of approximately $1.25 billion. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2022.

Factored receivables at December 31, 2022 associated with the Company's existing factoring agreement (the “Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement”) were approximately $420 million, a decrease of approximately $80 million from December 31, 2021. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company amended the Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement to (i) increase the amount of certain customer receivables that may be sold under the agreement, (ii) add new customers to the agreement and (iii) change the reference rate from London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time of the sales transaction. The Company classifies the proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable as an operating cash flow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company records the discount as other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and collections of accounts receivables not yet submitted to the financial institution as a financing cash flow.

The Company maintains an Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (the “Securitization Facility”). During the second quarter of 2022, the Company amended the Securitization Facility. This amendment (i) reduced the aggregate commitment under the Securitization Facility to $375 million from $600 million, (ii) extended its maturity by one year to October 2023 and (iii) changed the reference rate under the Securitization Facility from LIBOR to SOFR. The Securitization Facility bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate. The maximum availability under the Securitization Facility fluctuates based on eligible accounts receivable balances. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $35 million outstanding under the Securitization Facility.

On November 1, 2019, S&P Global Inc. (“S&P”) downgraded the Company’s debt rating to “BB+” as S&P believed the Company would fail to meet S&P’s target debt level for 2019. In addition, on March 9, 2020, Moody’s Corporation (“Moody’s”) downgraded the Company’s debt rating to “Ba1” based on a view that the Company would fail to meet Moody's target debt level for 2020. As a result of the S&P and Moody's downgrades, certain of the Company’s outstanding senior notes currently aggregating to approximately $3.1 billion were subject to an interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points for each downgrade, totaling 50 basis points. In addition, the Company’s ability to borrow from the commercial paper market on terms it deemed acceptable or favorable was eliminated and its cost of borrowing increased. The Company’s ability to borrow under the Credit Revolver was not affected by the downgrades.

On February 11, 2022, S&P upgraded the Company’s debt rating to “BBB-” from “BB+” as S&P believed the Company has been able to achieve S&P’s target debt level. As a result of this upgrade, the Company is again in a position to access the commercial paper market, up to a maximum of $1.5 billion provided there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Credit Revolver. In addition, the interest rates on certain of the Company’s outstanding senior notes aggregating to approximately $3.1 billion decreased by 25 basis points, reducing the Company’s interest expense by approximately $8 million on an annualized basis (approximately $7 million in 2022) as a result of the S&P upgrade. However, these senior notes will remain subject to the interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points resulting from the 2020 debt rating downgrade by Moody’s, which has an annualized impact on

39

interest expense of approximately $8 million. Furthermore, the Company may be required to pay higher interest rates in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease, as a result of any future downgrades.

On February 14, 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Company’s debt rating to “BB”. This downgrade does not impact the interest rates on any of the Company's senior notes.

The Company currently believes its capital structure and cash resources will continue to support the funding of future dividends and the Company will continue to evaluate all actions to strengthen its financial position and balance sheet, and to maintain its financial liquidity, flexibility and capital allocation strategy.

Risk Management

From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps. The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates. Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs. The settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.

Fair Value Hedges

At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a variable rate of interest plus a weighted average spread. These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $500 million of principal on the 6.375% senior notes due 2027, $500 million of principal on the 6.625% senior notes due 2029 and $100 million of principal on the 4.00% senior notes due 2024 for the remaining life of the notes. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.

Cross-Currency Contracts

The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain financing arrangements. The Company previously entered into three cross-currency swaps, maturing in January 2025, February 2025 and September 2027, respectively, with an aggregate notional amount of $1.26 billion. Each of these cross-currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges of the Company's foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries with Euro- denominated net assets, and the Company pays a fixed rate of Euro-based interest and receives a fixed rate of U.S. dollar interest. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into two cross-currency swaps with notional amounts of $500 million each, one maturing in September 2027 and the other in September 2029. These swaps were also designated as net investment hedges of the Company's foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries with Euro-denominated net assets, and the Company pays a floating rate of Euro-based interest and receives a floating rate of U.S. dollar interest. The Company has elected the spot method for assessing the effectiveness of these contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized income of $31 million, $16 million and $14 million, respectively, in interest expense, net, related to the portion of cross-currency swaps excluded from hedge effectiveness testing.

Foreign Currency Contracts

The Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales with maturity dates through December 2023. The derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCL”) until it is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $379 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory

40

purchases and sales.

The Company also uses foreign currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $926 million notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through August 2023. Fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other (income) expense, net in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received at December 31, 2022, and other non-cancelable obligations including capital assets and other licensing services.

The following table summarizes the effect that material contractual obligations and commitments are expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period at December 31, 2022. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:

For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps. Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect at December 31, 2022. For further information, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)Amounts represent lease liabilities on operating leases at December 31, 2022. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4)Primarily consists of purchase commitments with suppliers entered into at December 31, 2022, for the purchase of materials, packaging and other components and services. These purchase commitment amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally enforceable and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
(5)Represents the future cash payments related to 2017 Tax Reform, for the one-time provisional transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings.
(6)Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2022 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.

41

The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time; therefore, the $476 million in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table. The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors. See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $44 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical. See Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s most critical accounting policies, which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, are described below.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied or at a point in time, which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms, which is also when control is transferred. The Company’s primary performance obligation is the sale and distribution of its consumer and commercial products to its customers.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Certain customers may receive cash and/or non-cash incentives such as cash discounts, returns, credits or reimbursements related to defective products, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other customer-related programs, which are accounted for as variable consideration. In some cases, the Company applies judgment, including contractual rates and historical payment trends, when estimating variable consideration.

In addition, the Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers. Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs. Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis.

Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume. When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume. These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment. Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.
Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost. The Company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter (on December 1), or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant. On December 1, 2022, the carrying values for total goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were $3.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units. Reporting units are determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level. The Company’s operations are comprised of seven reporting units, within its five primary operating segments.

The quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, such as the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal values, discount rates and total enterprise value. The income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on five-year cash flow projections. The cash flows projected are analyzed on a debt-free basis (before cash payments to equity and interest-bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit. A provision is made, based on these projections, for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value. The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate. The Company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting its latest projections which included, among other things, the impact of significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods
transportation and labor on its operations at the time the Company performed its impairment testing.

See Footnotes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information associated with non-cash goodwill
impairment charges resulting from its annual test and triggering events during 2022.

Indefinite-lived intangibles

The testing of indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily trademarks and tradenames) under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as cash flow projections, royalty rates, terminal values and discount rates). An indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired by the amount its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method. The relief from royalty method estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset. The excess earnings method estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present. The excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges. Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.

See Footnotes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information associated with non-cash indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charges resulting from its annual test and triggering events during 2022.

Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment, operating leases and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, early termination of an operating lease, a significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. The Company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available, with the exception of the Yankee Candle business, where testing is performed at the retail store level. See Footnotes 6, 7, and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.

The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results.

The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity needs driving repatriations of non-U.S. cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions, determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.

It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items. For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits. Conversely, to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense. These matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits

The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The pension and postretirement obligations are measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to optimize the long-term return of pension plan assets. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

44

The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums. The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, in part due to plan demographics, funded status and liability duration. In general, the Company’s target asset allocations are as follows: global equities approximately 10% to 30%; fixed income approximately 70% to 90%; and cash, alternative investments and other, approximately zero to 10% at December 31, 2022. Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions. The Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans. The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile. At December 31, 2022, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 19% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 81%. Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.

For 2022, 2021 and 2020, the actual return on plan assets for the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately $(220) million, $48 million and $178 million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $47 million, $51 million and $59 million, respectively. The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates. Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2023 are estimated to be approximately $18 million, as compared to the 2022 contributions of approximately $17 million.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2022 was approximately 3.5% for the Company’s pension plans. The weighted average discount rate at the 2022 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively. A 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2022 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $33 million.

The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers. At December 31, 2022, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%. The current healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decrease to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%. See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

['s senior notes.

The Company currently believes its capital structure and cash resources will continue to support the funding of future dividends and the Company will continue to evaluate all actions to strengthen its financial position and balance sheet, and to maintain its financial liquidity, flexibility and capital allocation strategy.

Risk Management

From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps. The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates. Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs. The settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.

Fair Value Hedges

At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a variable rate of interest plus a weighted average spread. These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $500 million of principal on the 6.375% senior notes due 2027, $500 million of principal on the 6.625% senior notes due 2029 and $100 million of principal on the 4.00% senior notes due 2024 for the remaining life of the notes. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.

Cross-Currency Contracts

The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain financing arrangements. The Company previously entered into three cross-currency swaps, maturing in January 2025, February 2025 and September 2027, respectively, with an aggregate notional amount of $1.26 billion. Each of these cross-currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges of the Company']:

['s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s most critical accounting policies, which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, are described below.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied or at a point in time, which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms, which is also when control is transferred. The Company’s primary performance obligation is the sale and distribution of its consumer and commercial products to its customers.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Certain customers may receive cash and/or non-cash incentives such as cash discounts, returns, credits or reimbursements related to defective products, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other customer-related programs, which are accounted for as variable consideration. In some cases, the Company applies judgment, including contractual rates and historical payment trends, when estimating variable consideration.

In addition, the Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers. Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs. Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis.

Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume. When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume. These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment. Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.
Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost. The Company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter (on December 1), or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant. On December 1, 2022, the carrying values for total goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were $3.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units. Reporting units are determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level. The Company’s operations are comprised of seven reporting units, within its five primary operating segments.

The quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, such as the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal values, discount rates and total enterprise value. The income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on five-year cash flow projections. The cash flows projected are analyzed on a debt-free basis (before cash payments to equity and interest-bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit. A provision is made, based on these projections, for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value. The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate. The Company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting its latest projections which included, among other things, the impact of significant input cost inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods
transportation and labor on its operations at the time the Company performed its impairment testing.

See Footnotes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information associated with non-cash goodwill
impairment charges resulting from its annual test and triggering events during 2022.

Indefinite-lived intangibles

The testing of indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily trademarks and tradenames) under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as cash flow projections, royalty rates, terminal values and discount rates). An indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired by the amount its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method. The relief from royalty method estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset. The excess earnings method estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present. The excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges. Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.

See Footnotes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information associated with non-cash indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charges resulting from its annual test and triggering events during 2022.

Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment, operating leases and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, early termination of an operating lease, a significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. The Company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available, with the exception of the Yankee Candle business, where testing is performed at the retail store level. See Footnotes 6, 7, and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

43

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.

The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results.

The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.

It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items. extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period Financial Statements for further information.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits

The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized and investment advisors. The pension and postretirement obligations are measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to optimize the long-term return of pension plan assets. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current investments and other, approximately zero to 10% at December 31, 2022. Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of upon the plan structure and plan participant profile. At December 31, 2022, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 19% and Other Investments (alternative investments, 

 on plan assets of approximately $47 million, $51 million and $59 million, respectively. The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates. Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2023 are estimated to be approximately $18 million, as compared to the 2022 contributions of approximately $17 million.

The plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $33 million.

The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers. At December 31, 2022, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%. The current healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decrease to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...
