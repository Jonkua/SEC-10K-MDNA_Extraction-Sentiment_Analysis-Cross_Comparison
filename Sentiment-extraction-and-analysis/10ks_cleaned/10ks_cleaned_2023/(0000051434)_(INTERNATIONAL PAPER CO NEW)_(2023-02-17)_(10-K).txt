Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its Printing Papers business into a new, publicly-traded company, Sylvamo, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, on August 6, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Kwidzyn, Poland mill which included the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. As a result of the Sylvamo spin-off and the sale of Kwidzyn, the Company no longer has a Printing Papers segment, and all prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Sylvamo and Kwidzyn businesses as a discontinued operation. Both segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of less than wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

Note 19. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 129 68 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kinder Morgan, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to ex...

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its Printing Papers business into a new, publicly-traded company, Sylvamo, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, on August 6, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Kwidzyn, Poland mill which included the pulp and paper mill in Kwidzyn and supporting functions. As a result of the Sylvamo spin-off and the sale of Kwidzyn, the Company no longer has a Printing Papers segment, and all prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Sylvamo and Kwidzyn businesses as a discontinued operation. Both segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of less than wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.
