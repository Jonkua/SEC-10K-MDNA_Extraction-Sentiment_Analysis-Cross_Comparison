Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

Fiscal 2023: The Company achieved its second consecutive year of net sales in excess of $12 billion in fiscal 2023. Net sales were $12.1 billion, declining 3 percent compared to the prior year, as the benefit from pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures was more than offset by the impact of lower volumes in the Retail and International segments and lower net pricing in certain categories, such as bacon, reflecting raw material commodity deflation. Volume declined for the full year, primarily due to declines in commodity pork availability as a result of the Company's new pork supply agreement and lower turkey supply in the first half of the year due to the impacts of HPAI. Segment profit declined 11 percent, as higher results in the Foodservice segment were more than offset by significantly lower results in the Retail and International segments. Net earnings declined 21 percent due to lower segment profit and the pre-tax impact of an adverse arbitration ruling of $68.3 million. Adjusted net earnings(1) — excluding the impact of the adverse arbitration ruling, non-cash impairment charges, and costs associated with the Company's transformation and modernization initiative — declined 12 percent. Diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share(1) for fiscal 2023 were $1.45 and $1.61, respectively, compared to $1.82 last year.

Segment profit for the Foodservice segment increased due to improved mix across the portfolio. Retail segment profit declined significantly for the full year, driven primarily by lower volumes, unfavorable mix, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by the benefit from pricing actions across the portfolio and higher equity in earnings from MegaMex Foods, LLC (MegaMex Foods). International segment profit declined due to lower sales in China and lower turkey commodity sales.

The Company again reinvested into the business through capital expenditures and returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 were $270 million, including investments in new production capabilities for retail and foodservice pepperoni and an expansion for the SPAM® family of products. The Company continues to prioritize investments in growth, innovation, cost savings, automation, and maintenance. The annual dividend for 2024 will be $1.13 per share, representing an increase of 3 percent and marking the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases.

During fiscal 2023, the Company purchased a 30% common stock interest in Garudafood, a food and beverage company in Indonesia. This investment expands the Company's presence in Southeast Asia and supports the global execution of the snacking and entertaining strategic priority. The Company obtained this minority interest in Garudafood for a purchase price of $426 million, including associated transaction costs. The Company funded this transaction with cash on hand.

Fiscal 2024 Outlook(2): The Company continues to navigate through a dynamic operating environment characterized by slowing consumer demand, inflationary pressures, and headwinds in its turkey business. Net sales growth of 1 percent to 3 percent is expected and assumes volume growth in key categories, higher brand support and innovation, a benefit from incremental pricing actions, and the current assumptions for raw material input costs. From a bottom-line perspective, diluted net earnings per share are expected to be $1.43 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share(1) are expected to be $1.51 to $1.65. Earnings are expected to decline in the first half of the year due to the impact from lower turkey markets, lower volumes in the Retail segment, expenses associated with the transformation and modernization initiative, and softness in the Company's China business. Segment profit growth from all three segments is expected in the back half of the year as these pressures abate and as benefits from the transformation and modernization initiative are realized. Major risks to the outlook include incremental inflationary pressures, significantly lower turkey markets than expected, and the impact of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions on the Company's customers, consumers, and operators.

The Company remains in a strong financial position due to its consistent cash flow, liquidity, and strong balance sheet. The Company plans to continue to support the business through increased marketing and advertising investments for its leading brands as well as investments into its production capabilities, including converting the Barron, Wisconsin, plant into a value-added facility to support growth across the portfolio. The Company is also expanding capacity for high-demand Planters® snack nuts items. Returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends remains a top priority for the Company.

Consistent with the plan outlined at its recent investor day, the Company expects fiscal 2024 to be a year of investment and remains focused on its strategic priorities, executing on its transformation and modernization initiative, fueling its innovation pipeline, and exiting the year with momentum in its business segments. For fiscal 2024, the Company expects a modest benefit to net earnings from its transformation and modernization initiative.

The Company is a processor of branded and unbranded food products for retail, foodservice, deli, and commercial customers.

The Company transitioned to a new operating model in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and now reports its results in the following three reportable segments:

The Retail segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products sold predominantly in the retail market. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.

The Foodservice segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food and nutritional products for foodservice, convenience store, and commercial customers.

The International segment processes, markets, and sells Company products internationally. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s international joint ventures, equity method investments, and royalty arrangements.

Prior period segment results have been retrospectively recast to reflect the new reportable segments.

The Company’s fiscal year consisted of 52 weeks in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and 53 weeks in fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2024 will consist of 52 weeks.

Net Sales $ 3,198,079 $ 3,283,475 (2.6) $ 12,110,010 $ 12,458,806 (2.8)

Volume for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was comparable with last year, as higher turkey volumes in each segment were offset by lower Retail volumes in the convenient meals and proteins and the snacking and entertaining verticals. Net sales declined in the fourth quarter, as higher Foodservice segment sales and the benefit from higher turkey volumes were more than offset by lower volumes in the Retail segment and continued pressure in the International segment.

Fiscal 2023 marked the second consecutive year of net sales in excess of $12 billion. Net sales declined for the full year, as the benefit from pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures was more than offset by the impact of lower volumes in the Retail and International segments and lower net pricing in certain categories, such as bacon, reflecting raw material commodity

deflation. The primary drivers of lower volume in fiscal 2023 were declines in commodity pork availability as a result of the Company's new pork supply agreement and lower turkey supply in the first half of the year from the impacts of HPAI.

In fiscal 2024, the Company expects sales growth, which assumes benefits from modestly higher volumes, growth in key categories, higher brand support and innovation, incremental pricing actions, and the current assumptions for raw material costs. Risks to this outlook include slowing consumer demand and greater-than-expected pricing headwinds in the turkey business.

Cost of Products Sold $ 2,683,655 $ 2,717,058 (1.2) $ 10,110,169 $ 10,294,120 (1.8)

Cost of products sold for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023 decreased due to lower sales. On a volume basis, cost of products sold increased 2 percent in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by inflationary pressures stemming from, among other inputs, packaging, logistics, and labor.

In fiscal 2024, costs are expected to moderate relative to the high levels of inflation the business has absorbed since the beginning of fiscal 2021. Raw material input costs for pork, beef, and feed are anticipated to remain volatile and above historical levels. The Company expects its transformation and modernization initiative to begin delivering modest cost savings in fiscal 2024, targeting packaging, logistics, and production costs.

Percent of Net Sales 16.1 % 17.3 % 16.5 % 17.4 %

Consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023 decreased, driven primarily by unfavorable mix in the Retail and International segments and the persistent impact of inflationary pressures. Pricing actions helped mitigate some of the impact from inflationary pressures. Compared to fiscal 2022, gross profit as a percent of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year increased for the Foodservice segment but declined for the Retail and International segments.

In fiscal 2024, the Company expects gross profit as a percent of net sales to be comparable to fiscal 2023. Incremental cost inflation and unfavorable sales mix pose the largest risks to this outlook.

SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 increased as higher professional service expense related to the Company's transformation and modernization initiative and higher advertising expense were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses. For full year fiscal 2023, the increase in SG&A expenses and SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales is attributed to an adverse arbitration ruling totaling $68.3 million. Adjusted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales(1) for fiscal 2023 were comparable to the prior year.

Advertising investments in fiscal 2023 were $160 million, representing a 2% increase compared to fiscal 2022.

In fiscal 2024, the Company intends to continue investing in its leading brands and for full year advertising expense to increase compared to the prior year.

Research and development continues to be a vital part of the Company's strategy to grow existing brands and expand into new branded items. Research and development expenses were $33.7 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $34.7 million in fiscal 2022.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, volume and net sales growth from the value-added meats, emerging brands and bacon verticals was more than offset by declines in the convenient meals and proteins and the snacking and entertaining verticals. In addition to continued recovery across the Jennie-O® turkey portfolio, items such as Applegate® natural and organic meats, Hormel® Black Label® bacon, Chi-Chi's® and La Victoria® salsas, Corn Nuts® products and Hormel® Square Table™ entrees grew volume and net sales during the quarter. Net sales declines continued to be partially attributed to the difficult comparison from high levels of demand for Skippy® spreads last year. Full year fiscal 2023 net sales declined primarily due to lower volumes from the convenient meals and proteins and value-added meats verticals, declines in the snacking and entertaining vertical and lower market-driven pricing on raw bacon items.

Segment profit declined for the fourth quarter due to lower sales, unfavorable mix and increased brand investments. Additionally, a non-cash impairment charge of $28.4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter associated with the Justin's® trade name. For fiscal 2023, segment profit declined due to lower volumes, unfavorable mix, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by the benefit from pricing actions across the portfolio, higher equity in earnings from MegaMex Foods, and improved bacon volumes.

In fiscal 2024, the Company expects volume and net sales from its Retail segment to be comparable to the prior year. Volume growth in key categories, higher brand support and innovation, and a benefit from incremental pricing actions are expected to be positive catalysts for the business. Earnings are expected to decline compared to the prior year, driven primarily by commodity headwinds in the Company's turkey business. Risks to this outlook include a further slowing in consumer demand and greater-than-expected pricing headwinds in the turkey business.

Volume and net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 increased, driven by a significant recovery across the Jennie-O® turkey portfolio and strong demand for premium bacon, pizza toppings and premium breakfast sausage. Additionally, volume and net sales increased for the Cafe H®, Austin Blues® and Hormel® Cure 81® brands. Net sales declined for full year fiscal 2023 primarily due to lower net pricing in certain categories, reflecting raw material commodity deflation and lower turkey and fresh pork volumes.

For the fourth quarter, segment profit increased due to the contribution from higher volumes and improved mix. Segment profit increased during fiscal 2023 due to improved mix across the portfolio.

In fiscal 2024, the Company anticipates higher volume, net sales and segment profit from its Foodservice segment compared to the prior year. Risks to this outlook include a softening of foodservice industry demand, lower-than-expected raw material input costs (negatively impacting net sales), and higher-than-expected operating costs.

Segment Profit 9,511 28,810 (67.0) 55,234 107,642 (48.7)

As anticipated, net sales declined for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as a result of lower branded export volumes and lower sales in China, primarily related to the retail business. Volume growth was driven by low-margin turkey and commodity fresh pork. For the full year of fiscal 2023, net sales declined primarily due to lower SPAM® luncheon meat exports, lower sales in China, and lower commodity turkey prices.

Segment profit for the fourth quarter declined significantly due to continued softness in China and lower branded export demand, partially offset by the contribution from the Company's minority investment in Garudafood. Segment profit for fiscal 2023 declined significantly due to lower sales in China, lower commodity turkey sales, and lower branded export margins.

In fiscal 2024, the Company expects a rebound in its International segment, including higher net sales and segment profit. This recovery is expected to be driven by improvement across the business, including from its multinational businesses in China and Brazil, partnership in the Philippines, and branded exports. Risks to this outlook include continued softness in China and commodity headwinds impacting the export business.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, net unallocated expense increased as a result of higher pension costs, higher professional service expenses related to the Company's transformation and modernization initiative, and from the impairment of a corporate venturing investment. In addition to these drivers, net unallocated expense for fiscal 2023 increased as a result of an adverse arbitration ruling totaling $68.3 million.

(1)Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This filing includes measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. The Company utilizes these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate operating performance on a consistent basis. These measures may also be used when making decisions regarding resource allocation and in determining incentive compensation. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they facilitate year-over-year comparison and provide additional information about trends in the Company’s operations. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Adjusted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales excludes the impact of an adverse arbitration ruling and certain costs associated with the transformation and modernization initiative. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share excludes the impact of an adverse arbitration ruling, impairment charges associated with the Justin's® trade name and a corporate venturing investment, and costs associated with the transformation and modernization initiative. The tax impact was calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarter in which the expense was incurred. The non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted segment profit for the Retail segment excludes the impact of the impairment charge associated with the Justin's® trade name.

The Company's fiscal 2024 outlook for adjusted diluted net earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes, or has otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including estimated charges associated with the transformation and modernization initiative. The Company's strategic investments in the transformation and modernization initiative are expected to cease at the end of the investment period, are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, and are not considered representative of the Company's underlying operating performance.

The Company provides earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) because these measures are useful to management and investors as indicators of operating strength relative to prior years and are commonly used to benchmark the Company’s performance.

(1)  See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below for a description of the Company's use of measures not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Consistent with the Company's long-term strategy to better align resources to value-added growth, the overall decline in volume for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower commodity sales resulting from the Company's new pork supply agreement, which was effective January 1, 2022.

Net sales decreased for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 due to reduced commodity sales and the impact from an additional week of sales last year. Organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased, led by growth from the Retail and Foodservice segments. The Retail segment benefited from pricing actions effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

Fiscal 2022 marked the third consecutive year of record sales for the Company. Record net sales were primarily driven by the inclusion of the Planters® snack nuts business and growth from the Foodservice segment. All segments implemented pricing actions during the fiscal year to combat inflationary pressures.

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 decreased due to the impact from an additional week in the fourth quarter of last year and lower commodity sales. These declines more than offset strong demand for Skippy® peanut butter and the impact of pricing actions across the global flavors and convenient meals and proteins verticals. For fiscal 2022, net sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of the Planters® snack nuts business and the impact from strategic pricing actions. Consistent with the Company's from the Company's new pork supply agreement, in addition to supply impacts on the Company's vertically integrated supply chain as a result of HPAI.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, segment profit increased due to higher commodity turkey prices, improved value-added mix, and pricing actions to offset the impact from continued inflationary pressures.

Volume and net sales declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the impact from an additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and lower turkey sales. Partially offsetting these declines, products such as Hormel® Natural Choice® meats, Hormel® Bacon 1TM fully cooked bacon and Hormel® Fire BraisedTM flame-seared meats grew volume and sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 volume and net sales increased due to strong results across the portfolio as the industry continued to recover from pandemic-related declines and from the inclusion of the Planters® snack nuts business in the convenience channel.

The decline in segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by the impact from an additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and higher operational, logistics and raw material costs. Segment profit growth for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to significantly higher net sales as described above.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, volume and net sales growth from the SPAM® and Skippy® brands and the multinational businesses were more than offset by lower commodity turkey, fresh pork and refrigerated export sales. For fiscal 2022, volume and sales declined as a result of lower commodity sales due to the Company's new pork supply agreement, lower turkey sales as a result of the supply impacts on the Company's vertically integrated supply chain from HPAI, and ongoing export logistics challenges.

Segment profit declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as growth in China did not overcome the impact of lower commodity turkey sales, lower branded export margins, and higher logistics expenses for the export business. Segment profit for fiscal 2022 declined due in large part to lower results from the export business, which was negatively impacted by logistics challenges and meaningfully higher freight expenses.

Unallocated Income and Expense
The Company does not allocate deferred compensation, investment income, interest expense, or interest income to its segments when measuring performance. The Company also retains various other income and unallocated expenses at the corporate level.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, net unallocated expense increased slightly as unfavorable investment performance was mostly offset with lower corporate expense.

For fiscal 2022, net unallocated expense decreased due to one-time acquisition costs and accounting adjustments of $43 million related to the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business in fiscal 2021. The overall decline was partially offset by higher interest expense and lower investment income net of deferred compensation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share is presented to provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. This measurement excludes the impact of the acquisition-related expenses and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business. The tax impact was calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarter in which the expenses and accounting adjustments were incurred.

The non-GAAP financial measures of organic volume and organic net sales are presented to provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Organic volume and organic net sales exclude the impacts of the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business (June 2021) in the Retail, Foodservice, and International segments. Organic volume and organic net sales also exclude the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 as approximated based on average weekly sales for the fourth quarter (fourteen weeks) ended October 31, 2021.

The Company provides earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) because these measures are useful to management and investors as indicators of operating strength relative to prior years and are commonly used to benchmark the Company’s performance.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are the measures used to evaluate performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Table of Contents

Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
▪Cash flows from operating activities were largely impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
–Accounts receivable decreased $49 million in fiscal 2023 primarily due to timing of sales and more efficient collections. The $28 million decrease in fiscal 2022 is largely due to timing of collections.
–In fiscal 2023, inventory decreased $36 million as a result of strategic inventory management efforts implemented to address elevated inventory levels. The $352 million increase in fiscal 2022 is due to inflation in raw material and other input costs and maintaining higher inventory levels.
–Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $69 million in fiscal 2023 primarily due to cash collateral requirements for the Company's hedging programs and timing of payments related to infrastructure improvement commitments. The increase in fiscal 2022 of $15 million is primarily due to the timing of payments.
–Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $141 million in fiscal 2023 related to the timing of payments and lower promotional and incentive compensation expenses. In fiscal 2022, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $15 million related to the timing of payments.

Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
▪In fiscal 2023, the Company acquired a minority interest in Garudafood for $426 million, including associated transaction costs.
▪Capital expenditures were $270 million and $279 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The largest projects for fiscal 2023 included a new production line for the SPAM® family of products in Dubuque, Iowa, initial phases of the transition from harvest to value-added capacity in Barron, Wisconsin, wastewater infrastructure in Austin, Minnesota, and pepperoni capacity in Omaha, Nebraska. The largest spend in fiscal 2022 also included the capacity expansion for SPAM® and pepperoni as well as for bacon in Austin, Minnesota.

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
▪Cash dividends paid to the Company’s shareholders are an ongoing financing activity for the Company with payments totaling $593 million in fiscal 2023 and $558 million in fiscal 2022. The dividend rate was $1.10 per share in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.04 per share in fiscal 2022.
▪During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 310,000 shares for $12 million.

Sources and Uses of Cash
The Company's balanced business model, with diversification across raw material inputs, channels, and categories, provides stability in ever changing economic environments. The Company maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy by applying a waterfall approach, which focuses first on required uses of cash such as capital expenditures to maintain facilities, dividend returns to investors, mandatory debt repayments, and pension obligations. Next, the Company looks to strategic items in support of growth initiatives such as capital projects, acquisitions, additional dividend increases, and working capital investments. Finally, the Company evaluates opportunistic uses including incremental debt repayment and share repurchases.

The Company believes its anticipated income from operations, cash on hand, borrowing capacity under the current credit facility, and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet all short-term and long-term commitments. The Company continues to look for opportunities to make investments and acquisitions that align with its strategic priorities. The Company's ability to leverage its balance sheet through the issuance of debt provides the flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities which may require additional funding.

Dividend Payments
The Company remains committed to providing returns to investors through cash dividends. The Company has paid 381 consecutive quarterly dividends since becoming a public company in 1928. The annual dividend rate for fiscal 2024 will increase to $1.13 per share, representing the 58th consecutive annual dividend increase.

Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures are first allocated to required maintenance and then growth opportunities based on the needs of the business. Capital expenditures supporting growth opportunities in fiscal 2024 are expected to focus on projects related to value-added capacity, infrastructure, and new technology. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are estimated to be $280 million.

Debt
As of October 29, 2023, the Company’s outstanding debt included $3.3 billion of fixed rate unsecured senior notes due in fiscal 2024, 2028, 2030, and 2051 with interest payable semi-annually. During fiscal 2023, the Company made $55 million of interest payments and expects to make $55 million of interest payments in fiscal 2024 on these notes. In fiscal 2023, $950 million of the notes was reclassified as Current Maturities of Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note L - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Borrowing Capacity
As a source of short-term financing, the Company maintains a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The maximum commitment under this credit facility may be further increased by $375 million, generally by mutual agreement of the lenders and

30

Table of Contents

the Company, subject to certain customary conditions. Funds drawn from this facility may be used by the Company to refinance existing debt, for working capital or other general corporate purposes, and for funding acquisitions. The lending commitments under the facility are scheduled to expire on May 6, 2026, at which time the Company will be required to pay in full all obligations then outstanding. As of October 29, 2023, the Company had no outstanding draws from this facility.

Debt Covenants
The Company’s debt and credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions including representations, warranties, and covenants. These debt covenants limit the ability of the Company to, among other things, incur debt for borrowed money secured by certain liens, engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions, and require maintenance of certain consolidated leverage ratios. As of October 29, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and expects to maintain compliance in the future.

Cash Held by International Subsidiaries
As of October 29, 2023, the Company had $164 million of cash and cash equivalents held by international subsidiaries. The Company maintains all undistributed earnings as permanently reinvested. The Company evaluates the balance and uses of cash held internationally based on the needs of the business.

Share Repurchases
The Company is authorized to repurchase 3,677,494 shares of common stock as part of an existing plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 310,000 shares for $12 million. The Company continues to evaluate share repurchases as part of its capital allocation strategy.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can

31

Table of Contents

have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:

Revenue Recognition
Description: The Company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer. Obligations for the Company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer. Revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns, and allowances.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers. Incentives offered off-invoice include prompt pay allowances, will call allowances, spoilage allowances, and temporary price reductions. These incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time control is transferred. Coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products. The coupons reduce revenue at the time they are offered, based on estimated redemption rates. Promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the Company’s products to consumers. These incentives reduce revenue at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds. Accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year. Accruals with customers are based on defined performance.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year. The level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities.

Income Taxes
Description: The Company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. As of October 29, 2023, the Company had $21.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, recorded in Other Long-term Liabilities.

Business Combinations
Description: The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as Goodwill.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets. Fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined through established valuation techniques, such as the income, cost or market approach. The Company may utilize third-party valuation experts to assist in the fair value determination. The fair value measurements of identifiable intangibles are based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about the future. Significant assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets may include projected revenue growth, estimated cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and other factors.

Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the Company’s intent to continue to support and build the brands. Other acquired assets, such as customer relationships, are expected to have determinable useful lives.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The Company did not have any business combinations in fiscal 2023 and 2022. On June 7, 2021, the Company acquired the Planters® snack nuts business for $3.4 billion and used a third-party valuation specialist to perform the valuation of the assets acquired. Refer to Note B - Acquisitions and Divestitures of the Notes to the Consolidated

32

Table of Contents

Financial Statements for additional information. The Company acquired trade names which were determined to have a fair value of $712.0 million. Key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the trade names using a relief from royalty model included revenue projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. The Company also identified customer relationships which were assigned a fair value of $51.0 million using the distributor method under the income approach. Assumptions in valuing this asset included future earnings projections, customer attrition rate, and discount rate, among others. The Company believes the estimates applied are based on reasonable assumptions, but which are inherently uncertain. As a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine fair value of the assets acquired, which could result in material impairment losses in the future.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Description: Other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include trade names obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the Company’s reporting units: Retail, Foodservice, and International. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Company’s procedures.

Judgments and Uncertainties: Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment. Indefinite-lived trade names are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions include royalty rate, annual projected revenue, discount rate, and estimated long-term growth rate. Estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows, revenues, earnings, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other factors.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.

As a result of organizational changes in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company conducted an assessment of its operating segments and reporting units. Based on this analysis, goodwill was reallocated using the relative fair value approach. Prior to the goodwill reallocation, an impairment assessment was performed which indicated no impairment to the Company's reporting units. Subsequent to the goodwill reallocation, the Company completed quantitative impairment testing on each new reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value by more than 50 percent. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded as a result of the assessment. Based on the quantitative testing performed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, a 10 percent decline in projected cash flows or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in an impairment.

The Company also performed a qualitative impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result of the qualitative assessment, it was determined that it was more likely than not the Justin's® trade name was impaired, and the Company performed a quantitative impairment test. As a result of the quantitative impairment test, a $28.4 million intangible asset impairment charge was recorded for the Justin's® trade name. No other impairment charges were recorded as a result of the qualitative assessment. The Company last completed quantitative testing for the other indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021 and the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value by more than 10 percent. Based on the fiscal 2021 testing, a 10 percent decline in forecasted revenue or 10 percent increase in the discount rate would not result in a material impairment. Based on the fiscal 2023 quantitative impairment test, a 10 percent decline in forecasted revenue or 10 percent increase in the discount rate used for the Justin's® trade name would not result in additional material impairment.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits
Description: The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension and post-retirement health care benefit plans and recognizes the associated expenses, assets, and liabilities.

Judgments and Uncertainties: In accounting for these employment costs and the associated benefit obligations, management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates, discount rates, compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates, and interest crediting rates. The Company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates. Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on fair value, composition of the asset portfolio, historical long-term rates of return, and estimates of future performance. Mortality and discount rates used are based on actuarial tables elected at each fiscal year-end. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation.

33

Table of Contents

Benefit plan assets are stated at fair value. Due to the lack of readily available market prices, private equity investments are valued by models using a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples, discounted cash flows, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Other benefit plan investments are measured at Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of the fund's underlying investments as a practical expedient.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The assumed discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increase, interest crediting rate, and the health care cost trend rate have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. For the year ended October 29, 2023, the Company had $1.2 billion and $186.2 million in pension benefit obligation and post-retirement benefit obligation, respectively. For fiscal 2024, the Company expects pension benefit costs of $44.3 million and post-retirement benefit costs of $10.5 million. A one-percentage-point change in these rates would have the following effects:

------------------------------------------------ -------------------- ------ ------------------ ----- -------- ---- -------- - ------- - -----

 Benefit Cost Benefit Obligation
In millions Increase Decrease Increase Decrease

Discount Rate $ (11.0) $ 13.0 $ (108.5) $ 129.7

Post-retirement Benefits
Discount Rate $ (0.2) $ 0.3 $ (12.4) $ 14.3
Health Care Cost Trend Rate 1.0 (0.9) 14.3 (12.6)

As of October 29, 2023, the Company had $79.4 million and $638.4 million of private equity and NAV investments, respectively. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements. The Company also holds quarterly meetings with the investment adviser to review fund performance, which include comparisons to the relevant indices. On an annual basis, the Company performs pricing tests on certain underlying investments to gain additional assurance of the reliability of values received from the fund manager.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Management']:
(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

['s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can

have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:

Revenue Recognition
Description: The Company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to the customer. Obligations for the Company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer. Revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns, and allowances.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers. Incentives offered off-invoice include prompt pay allowances, will call allowances, spoilage allowances, and temporary price reductions. These incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time control is transferred. Coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products. The coupons reduce revenue at the time they are offered, based on estimated redemption rates. Promotional contracts are performed by customers to promote the Company’s products to consumers. These incentives reduce revenue at the time of performance through direct payments and accrued promotional funds. Accrued promotional funds are unpaid liabilities for promotional contracts in process or completed at the end of a quarter or fiscal year. Accruals with customers are based on defined performance.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The liability relating to these agreements is based on a review of the outstanding contracts on which performance has taken place but which the promotional payments relating to such contracts remain unpaid as of the end of the fiscal year. The level of customer performance and the historical spend rate versus contracted rates are estimates used to determine these liabilities.

Income Taxes
Description: The in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. As of October 29, 2023, the Company had $21.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, recorded in Other Long-term Liabilities.

Business Combinations
Description: The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as Goodwill.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the acquired assets. Fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined through established valuation techniques, such as the income, cost or market approach. The Company may utilize third-party valuation experts to assist in the fair value determination. The fair value measurements of identifiable intangibles are based on available historical information and expectations and assumptions about the future. Significant assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets may include projected revenue growth, estimated cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and other factors.

Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain acquired brands are determinable useful lives.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The Company did not have any business combinations in fiscal 2023 and 2022. On June 7, 2021, the Company acquired the Planters® snack nuts business for $3.4 billion and used a third-party valuation specialist to perform the valuation of the assets acquired. Refer to Note B - Acquisitions and Divestitures of the Notes to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for additional information. The Company acquired trade names which were determined to have a fair value of $712.0 million. Key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the trade names using a relief from royalty model included revenue projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. The Company also identified customer relationships which were assigned a fair value of $51.0 million using the distributor method under the income approach. Assumptions in valuing this asset included future earnings projections, customer attrition rate, and discount rate, among others. The Company believes the estimates applied are based on reasonable assumptions, but which are inherently uncertain. As a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions and judgments used to determine fair value of the assets acquired, which could result in material impairment losses in the future.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Description: Other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include trade names obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the Company’s reporting units: Retail, Foodservice, and International. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Company’s procedures.

Judgments and Uncertainties: Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment. Indefinite-lived trade names are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions include royalty rate, annual projected revenue, discount rate, and estimated long-term growth rate. Estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows, revenues, earnings, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other factors.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.

As a result of organizational changes in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company conducted an assessment of its operating segments and reporting units. Based on this analysis, goodwill was reallocated using the relative fair value approach. Prior to the goodwill reallocation, an impairment assessment was performed which indicated no impairment to the Company']:
