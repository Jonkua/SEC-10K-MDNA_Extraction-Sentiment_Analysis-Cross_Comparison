Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements.
Changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.
We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.

Overview
We operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region, product range, and customer. We hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors, including the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network.
Net sales in U.S. dollars increased 5% in 2022 and 21% in 2021. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 11% in 2022 and 18% in 2021. In 2022, we experienced strong growth in most businesses with favorable market conditions and excellent execution. Growth in China and the Americas was particularly strong. We continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions, diversified customer base, innovative product offering, investment in emerging markets, significant installed base, and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities, more effectively pricing our products and services, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities, increasing the use of digital tools, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes.
During 2022, we faced significant external challenges, such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China, unfavorable foreign currency and increased interest rates. Our team’s resilience and agility to quickly react to adapt to the changing environment were critical to our success. Our supply chain also was a competitive advantage, while our productivity and pricing programs helped offset significant inflationary pressures. Over the past few years, we also accelerated our ability to use advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities, while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our global sales organization. We also have continued to increase engagement with our customers with our Go-to-Market and digital approaches. Our Service business also delivered very strong results in 2022 as we have been able to support our customers’ ability to maintain uptime, improve productivity and comply with regulatory requirements.
As we enter 2023, we expect to continue to benefit from market trends towards automation and digitalization, as well as customer investments in on/near-shoring activities. However, market conditions and challenges remain uncertain relating to the macro environment and global economy, including the impacts of tighter monetary policies and related increase in interest rates to combat inflation, ongoing developments related to Ukraine, and COVID-19 (particularly in China). We also will face difficult prior period comparisons in 2023 due to strong results in both 2022 and 2021. Furthermore, inflationary cost increases and challenges in the global supply chain may continue, and market conditions may change quickly.
Our laboratory sales experienced excellent growth in 2022, particularly from life sciences and biotech customers. We expect to continue to benefit from favorable biopharma market trends. We also believe we will continue to benefit from increased customer demand for automation, digitalization, and safety; new facility investments; and continued focus on regulatory compliance including data integrity requirements. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our laboratory business.
Our industrial sales experienced strong growth in 2022 in both core industrial and product inspection. Core industrial experienced particularly strong growth, especially in China and the U.S. We continue to benefit from our strong product offering and focus on the more attractive, faster-growing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region. We also continue to benefit from

market trends in automation and digitalization and also expect to benefit from customer on/near-shoring activities in the future. China and emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies, and we expect this to be a source of future growth. Our core industrial-related products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth. We expect our product inspection end-market to also benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection, food safety, and productivity. However, product inspection customers in the packaged food industry have been negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 situation in China.
Our food retailing sales increased modestly during 2022 primarily due to improved project activity in the United States and Europe, while we experienced weaker market conditions in China. Traditionally, the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other end-markets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations.
In 2023, we will continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:
Gaining Market Share. Innovation is essential to gaining market share and is fundamental in all aspects of our business including sales and marketing and technology leadership. Our global sales and marketing initiative, Spinnaker, continues to be an important growth strategy. We aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs, leveraging our extensive customer databases, product offering and installed base. While this initiative is broad-based, efforts to improve these processes include the use of advanced data analytics to identify, prioritize, and pursue growth opportunities; the implementation of more effective pricing related to value-based selling strategies and processes; improved sales force guidance, training and effectiveness; cross-selling; increased segment marketing; and leads generation and nurturing activities. We also have added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities, and continue to adapt our Go-to-Market approaches with additional inside and telesales resources, while also increasing digital customer interaction. We continue to benefit from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force. In addition, our comprehensive service offerings, and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings, help us further penetrate developed markets.
We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world, and we continue to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract, or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base. In addition to traditional repair and maintenance, our service offerings continue to expand into value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance. We have also made adjustments to our service model to incorporate remote service, depot drop-off/pickup, and other approaches.
Faster Growing Markets. Emerging markets, comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, account for approximately 37% of our total net sales. We have a two-pronged strategy in emerging markets: first, to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in these markets, and second, to leverage our low-cost manufacturing operations in China. We have a 35-year track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than 13% on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999. Over the years, we also have broadened our product offering to the Asian markets. India has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities. Overall, versus the prior year, we experienced a 12% increase in emerging market local currency sales by destination during 2022, which included 14% local currency sales growth in China. Within China, we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the faster-growing segments of pharma, food manufacturing, chemical, and new energy. We believe the long-term growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the Chinese government’s emphasis on

science, high-value industries, product quality, and food safety. We expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on these segments. We also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in under-penetrated emerging markets. However, emerging market sales can be volatile. In particular, China has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors. In addition to China and emerging markets, we also pursue other faster growth vertical markets. While rather small, these markets present outsized growth potential. Segments include lithium ion battery, semiconductors, advanced materials and plant-based food. The components of these faster growing segments will change as various markets develop and we will continue to leverage the breadth and scope of our product offering as new opportunities emerge.
Extending Our Technology Lead. We continue to focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent approximately 5% of net sales on research and development. We seek to improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software, which we believe supports our pricing differentiation and accelerates product replacement cycles. In addition, we aim to create value for our customers by having thorough knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base.
Expanding Our Margins. During 2022, we experienced increased inflation in our cost structure, particularly regarding costs for product materials and transportation and logistics. However, despite these challenges to our cost structure, we continue to strive to improve our margins by enhancing our value proposition via innovation, more effectively pricing our products and services, optimizing our cost structure, and improving our mix in higher-margin businesses such as service. For example, sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes. We also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives, higher-growth/profitable areas, and opportunities for margin improvement.
We also have implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering costs, and have increased our focus on these programs with our SternDrive initiative. SternDrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain, manufacturing, and back-office operations. Blue Ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives. Our move to standardized business processes, systems, and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to real-time data. Our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as reducing our working capital levels, improving our order to cash cycle, and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures.
Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions. We seek to pursue "bolt-on" acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels, and technological leadership. We have identified life sciences and process analytics as key areas for acquisitions. For example, in 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. The initial cash payment was $185.0 million and we made other post-closing payments of $7.4 million. We have paid an additional $10.0 million related to an earn-out provision in the agreement during 2022 and expect to pay additional consideration of $10.0 million in 2023. In 2021, we also acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets. The initial cash payment was $20.2 million and we may be required to pay additional consideration up to EUR 3.0 million.

COVID-19
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread globally in all countries where we conduct business. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns, travel restrictions, vaccination and testing requirements, and other public health safety measures. The emergence of COVID-19 variants and subvariants has presented particular challenges to the global economy given the high level of transmissibility, which can cause many people to be affected at the same time or over a short period of time. For example, China recently eased its “zero COVID” policies related to previous lockdowns as part of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result China has experienced a significant increase in COVID-19 cases which may have negative implications on our business and supply chain, as well as the Chinese and global economies.
COVID-19 presents several risks to our business as further described on page 14 in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K. Uncertainties related to COVID-19 and the resulting impact to the global economy continue in most regions of the world, and market conditions can change quickly. The longer-term effects on our business will be influenced by the global economy and any economic implications in different regions of the world.
Ongoing Developments Related to Ukraine
We continue to monitor the ongoing developments related to Ukraine, as well as the status of all applicable sanctions. We have remained in close contact with our employees in Ukraine and have provided financial assistance and supplies to them. We suspended all shipments to Russia since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. For historical reference, in 2021, approximately 1% of our net sales were in Russia and Ukraine, and we had an immaterial amount of assets and liabilities in both countries as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We also do not have manufacturing in Russia or Ukraine.
The ongoing developments related to Ukraine present several risks to our business as further described on page 15 in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K. While it is difficult to estimate the impact of the ongoing invasion on the global economy, including increased inflation, higher energy and transportation costs and potential energy shortages, the invasion of Ukraine could adversely impact our financial results and presents several risks to our business.
Results of Operations — Consolidated
Net sales
Net sales were $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $3.7 billion in 2021 and $3.1 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of 5% in 2022 and 21% in 2021 in U.S. dollars and an increase of 11% in 2022 and 18% in 2021 in local currencies. In 2022, we experienced strong growth in most businesses and regions with particularly strong growth in China and the Americas. We continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques. However, there is uncertainty in the economic environment, including the risk of recession in some countries. Uncertainties and challenges also continue relating to ongoing developments related to Ukraine, COVID-19 (particularly in China), inflation, and supply chain challenges, and market conditions may change quickly.
In 2022, our net sales by geographic destination increased in U.S. dollars compared to 2021 by 11% in the Americas and 7% in Asia/Rest of World and decreased 5% in Europe. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2022 by 12% in the Americas, 6% in Europe, and 13% in Asia/Rest of World, with 14% growth in China. Suspending shipments in Russia reduced our local

Segment profit decreased $9.7 million in our Other segment during 2022, compared to an increase of $22.1 million during 2021. The decrease in segment profit during 2022 primarily relate to unfavorable foreign currency translation, offset by increased sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives.
Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Future Cash Requirements
Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments. Sources of liquidity include cash flows from operating activities, available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing, and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.
We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future.
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $859.1 million in 2022, compared to $908.8 million in 2021 and $724.7 million in 2020. The decrease in 2022 is primarily due to higher cash incentive payments related to our strong prior year performance and increased inventory levels to mitigate supply chain challenges.
Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment, and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $121.2 million in 2022, $107.6 million in 2021, and $92.5 million in 2020. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be approximately $15 million higher than 2022 subject to business and economic conditions.

In September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. As of December 31, 2022, we have obtained $29.7 million of the $35.8 million of total funding to be received through 2023, which will offset associated capital expenditures. During the period ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $28.1 million of capital expenditures relating to this funding agreement.
We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In March 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. The initial cash payment was $185.0 million and we made other post-closing payments of $7.4 million. Additional consideration of $10.0 million was paid in 2022, and we expect to pay additional consideration of $10.0 million in 2023. In October 2021, the Company acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets. The initial cash payment was $20.2 million and the Company may be required to pay additional amounts up to EUR 3.0 million. For additional information related to these acquisitions, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling $38.0 million, $8.3 million, and $6.2 million, respectively.
Cash flows used in financing activities during 2022 primarily comprised share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent $1.1 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion and $775.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively on the repurchase of 838,010 shares, 739,486 shares, and 815,652 shares, respectively. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares; however, in 2023, we intend to spend a similar amount on the repurchase of shares as we spent in 2022, subject to business and economic conditions.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income. We expect the financial impact of the IRA to be immaterial to our financial statements.
We plan to continue to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes. All other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. We believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity.

(1) See Note 6 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $547.0 million of additional borrowings were available under our Credit Agreement and we maintained $96.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2022, the interest payments associated with 73% of the Company’s debt are fixed obligations. We expect to make interest payments of approximately $75.0 million during 2023 associated with our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2022.
Senior Notes
The Senior Notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2022, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $150 million 10-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We will issue $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.45% in March 2023, which will mature in March 2033. We will use the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.
In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $300 million 15-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.81% (2.81% Senior Notes) in March 2022, which will mature in March 2037, and we issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of

2.91% (2.91% Senior Notes) in September 2022, which will mature in September 2037. We used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.
Credit Agreement
On June 25, 2021, we entered into a $1.25 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our $1.1 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), which is further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
Other Local Arrangements
In April 2018, two of our non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2022.
Share Repurchase Program
In November 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.5 billion to the share repurchase program which has $3.5 billion of remaining availability as of December 31, 2022. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.
We have purchased 31.0 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through December 31, 2022, at a total cost of $8.0 billion. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we spent $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion on the repurchase of 838,010 shares and 739,486 shares at an average price per share of $1,312.61 and $1,352.27, respectively. We reissued 133,916 shares and 110,748 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Effect of Currency on Results of Operations
Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.8 million to $2.0 million annually.
We also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $3.7 million to $4.2 million annually.
In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro.

Table of Contents
Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2022, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $35 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.
Taxes
We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in law, the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions, and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions. Generally, the tax liability for each taxpayer within the Mettler-Toledo International Inc. group of companies is determined either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.
We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, LLC known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc. was one of two private parties ordered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in an administrative consent order signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed became solely responsible for compliance with the order. Residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a Classification Exception Area which the Department of Environmental Protection has approved and within which the Company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the site. The Department of Environmental Protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of $0.4 million.
In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Inflation
Global inflation significantly increased in 2022 and 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, supply chains/logistics, and labor markets, as well as the war in Ukraine and related significant increase in energy costs. Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as transportation and logistical costs and other external costs and services. Inflation can also affect labor

Table of Contents
costs which are a significant element of our overall cost structure. Inflation can also lead to increased interest rates as country monetary policies combat inflation. This can result in reduced economic growth and recessionary conditions, as well as higher borrowing costs. Inflation presents several risks to our business as further described on page 21 in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.
We have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $4.1 million at December 31, 2022. Based on our agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022, a 100-basis-point change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately $4.5 million. Any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, income taxes, inventories, goodwill and intangibles, leases, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Income taxes
Income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance of $62.6 million as of December 31, 2022 is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the valuation allowance in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
We plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be non-U.S. withholding taxes, certain state taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any. All other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.

45

Table of Contents
The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, each increase of $10.7 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1%.
Employee benefit plans
The net periodic pension cost for 2022 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 were $0.5 million and $110.3 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension plan. The net periodic cost for 2022 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 were $3.3 million and $785.3 million, respectively, for our international pension plans. The net periodic post-retirement benefit for 2022 and expected post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations. The most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense.
The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets, which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities. In 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2022, the weighted average return on assets assumption was 6.75% for the U.S. plan and 3.84% for the international plans. A change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $7.8 million after tax.
The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds. For 2022, the weighted average discount rate assumption was 4.9% for the U.S. plan and 2.6% for the international plans, representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A change in the discount rate of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $10.8 million after tax.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $660.2 million and other intangible assets of $306.1 million.
Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.

46

Table of Contents
If we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized.
Both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results, business plans, economic conditions, and market data, among other factors. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.
Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.
Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.

Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix.

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
