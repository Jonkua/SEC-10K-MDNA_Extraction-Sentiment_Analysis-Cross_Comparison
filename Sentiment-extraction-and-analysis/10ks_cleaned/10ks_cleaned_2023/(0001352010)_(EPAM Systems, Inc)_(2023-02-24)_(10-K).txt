Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Future Capital Requirements
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. However, the invasion of Ukraine, COVID-19 and the consequences and related measures to contain their impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial markets and economies. The future impact of the invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 and responsive measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Table of Contents
Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. Our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors including the impact of the invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic, each as described elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and operating cash flows are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. There is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
See Note 9 “Leases”, Note 10 “Debt”, Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our various contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
We do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.
