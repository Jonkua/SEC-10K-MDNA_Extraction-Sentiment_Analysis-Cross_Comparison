Overview

Ceridian is a global HCM software company. We categorize our solutions into two categories: Cloud and Bureau solutions. Cloud revenue is primarily generated from HCM solutions that are delivered via two Cloud offerings: Dayforce, our flagship Cloud HCM platform, and Powerpay, a Cloud HR and payroll solution for the Canadian small business market. We also continue to support customers using our legacy North America Bureau solutions, which we generally stopped actively selling to new customers following the acquisition of Dayforce, and customers using our acquired Bureau solutions in APJ. We invest in maintenance and necessary updates to support our Bureau customers and continue to migrate them to Dayforce. Revenue from our Cloud and Bureau solutions includes investment income generated from holding customer funds before they are remitted to taxing authorities, also referred to as float revenue or float.

Dayforce provides HR, payroll, workforce management, benefits, and talent intelligence functionality. Our platform is used by organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to global organizations, regardless of industry, to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing their people. Dayforce was built as a single application from the ground up that combines a modern, consumer-grade user experience with proprietary application architecture, including a single employee record and a rules engine spanning all areas of HCM. Dayforce provides continuous real-time calculations across all modules to enable, for example, payroll administrators access to data through the entire pay period, and managers access to real-time data to optimize work schedules. Our platform is designed to ease administrative work for both employees and managers, creating opportunities for companies to increase employee engagement. We sell Dayforce through our direct sales force and partner ecosystem on a subscription per-employee, per-month (“PEPM”) basis. Our subscriptions are typically structured with an initial fixed term of between three and five years, with evergreen renewal thereafter.

We have rapidly grown the Dayforce platform to 5,993 live Dayforce customers, representing approximately 5.9 million global employees as of December 31, 2022.* In 2022, we added 559 net new live Dayforce customers. Our customers vary across industries, and no single customer constituted more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our annual Dayforce revenue retention rate continues to exceed 95% due to our focus on solving complex problems and our superior customer experience.

Dayforce Wallet is a digital payment solution for customers' employees on the Dayforce platform, which was launched in the U.S. in 2020, Canada in 2021, and the United Kingdom in 2022. The Dayforce Wallet gives our customers’ employees greater control over their financial well-being by providing them with instant access to their earnings. This on-demand pay feature allows employees more choice over when they get paid by making any day payday. Dayforce Wallet enables workers to access their already-earned wages anytime during the pay period, net of taxes, withholdings and other payroll deductions. Leveraging Dayforce’s continuous pay calculations, Dayforce Wallet processes a same-day payroll each time a worker requests their pay. The solution is compliant with federal, state, and local remittances and requires no changes to payroll processing including the funding, timing, and close-out of pay. The on-demand wages are loaded onto a paycard, which customers’ employees can use anywhere credit or debit cards are accepted, generating interchange fee revenue. The Dayforce Wallet mobile app makes it easy for customers’ employees to check their pay deposits, account balance and transaction history.

As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 1,450 customers signed onto Dayforce Wallet with over 880 customers live on the product and the average registration rate was above 45% of all eligible employees.

Our Business Model

Our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and our high customer retention rates, we have a high level of visibility into our future revenues. The profitability of a customer depends, in large part, on how long they have been a customer. We estimate that it takes approximately two years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract.

Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, we have the opportunity to realize additional PEPM revenue, both as the customer grows or rolls out the Dayforce solution to additional employees, and also by selling additional functionality to existing customers that do not currently utilize our full suite of capabilities. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to take customers live.

Revenues

We generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our Cloud solutions, Dayforce and Powerpay, as well as from our Bureau solutions. We also generate professional services and other revenue associated primarily with the work performed to assist customers with the planning, design, and implementation of their Cloud-based solution. Our solutions are typically provided through long-term customer relationships that result in a high level of recurring revenue. We also generate recurring revenue from investment income on our Cloud and Bureau customer funds before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. We refer to this investment income as float revenue.

For Dayforce, we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a PEPM basis, generally one-month in advance of service, based on the number and type of solutions provided to the customer and the number of employees and other users at the customer. Our standard Dayforce contracts are generally for a three to five-year period. The average time it takes to implement Dayforce typically ranges from three months for smaller customers to twelve months for larger customers. We begin to generate recurring revenue when we provide a production instance to the customer. We also provide outsourced human resource solutions to certain of our Dayforce customers, which are tailored to meet their individual needs, and entail performing the duties of a customer’s human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting, as needed.

The Powerpay offering serves our small market Canadian customers. The typical Powerpay customer has fewer than 20 employees, and the majority of the revenue is generated from recurring fees charged on a per-employee, per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer’s payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers’ remittance advices or checks. Powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days, at which point we start receiving recurring fees.

For our Bureau solutions, we typically charge recurring fees on a per-process basis. Typical processes include the customer’s payroll runs, year-end tax packages, and delivery of customers’ remittance advices or checks. In addition to customers who use our payroll services, certain customers use our tax filing services on a stand-alone basis. Our outsourced human resource solutions are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, and entail our contracting to perform many of the duties of a customer’s human resources department, including payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting. We also perform individual services for customers, such as check printing, wage attachment and disbursement, and ACA management.

Global Events

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic created significant global volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. We experienced curtailed customer demand, primarily as a result of declining employment levels at our customers in certain sectors, such as retail and hospitality, as well as lower customer utilization of professional services, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we experienced adverse impacts on our revenue in 2021 and 2020, we ended 2021 with employment levels at our customers in-line with pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the federal funds rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the overnight rate target by the Bank of Canada had negative effects on our float revenue in 2021 and 2020. Conversely, the federal funds rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the overnight rate target by the Bank of Canada in 2022 has had positive effects on our float revenue in 2022. The continued, broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on numerous evolving factors. Consequently, the extent of any potential future impacts of COVID-19 remain uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated. Please refer to Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the potential impact of the pandemic on our business.

In February 2022, the Russian Federation (“Russia”) and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. We are closely monitoring the unfolding events due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its regional and global ramifications. We do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus. We are monitoring any broader economic impact from the current crisis, including increased cybersecurity risks. The specific impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not material as of the date of these financial statements. However, to the extent that such military action spreads to other countries, intensifies, or otherwise remains active, such action could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

How We Assess Our Performance

In assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance indicators in addition to revenue and net income (loss). Set forth below is a description of our key performance measures.

Live Dayforce Customers

We use the number of live Dayforce customers as an indicator of future revenue and the overall performance of the business and to assess the performance of our implementation services. We market Dayforce to customers of all sizes, including small (under 500 employees), major (500 to 5,999 employees), and enterprise (6,000 or more employees).

The following table sets forth the number of live Dayforce customers* at the end of the years presented:

Cloud Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)

We use Cloud annualized recurring revenue ("ARR"), a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure the size and growth of our recurring Cloud business, which we believe is useful to management and investors. We derive the majority of our Cloud revenues from recurring fees, primarily PEPM subscription charges. We also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks, charges for once-a-year services, such as year-end tax statements, and float revenue on our customer funds before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities, customer employees, or other third parties. We set annual targets for Cloud ARR and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis.

Annual Dayforce Revenue Retention Rate

We use annual Dayforce revenue retention rate, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing Dayforce customers, which we believe is useful to management and investors as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues. Our annual Dayforce revenue retention rate has been above 97% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and above 95% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We set annual targets for Dayforce revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known and anticipated customer losses. Our Dayforce revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the mix of Dayforce solutions used by customers, the level of customer satisfaction, and changes in the number of users live on our Dayforce solutions.

Dayforce Recurring Revenue Per Customer

We use Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of the average size of our Dayforce customer, which we believe is also useful to management and investors. We calculate and monitor Dayforce recurring revenue per customer on a quarterly basis. Our Dayforce recurring revenue per customer may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of live Dayforce customers and the number of customers purchasing the full HCM suite.

*Excluding the 2021 acquisitions of Ascender and ADAM HCM.

Constant Currency Revenue

We present revenue on a constant currency basis to assess how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to management and investors. We have calculated revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period. The average U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate was $1.30, with a daily range of $1.25 to $1.39 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.25, with a daily range of $1.20 to $1.29 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate was $1.36.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin

We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. Management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations.

On December 15, 2021, we sold our St. Petersburg, Florida facility for $40 million, resulting in a gain on the sale of $19.1 million, which was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations within selling, general, and administrative expense.

The OCC authorized the Ceridian National Trust Bank to open on January 3, 2023. Effective on this day, the Ceridian National Trust Bank commenced banking operations, acting as trustee for our U.S. payroll trust.

Historically, certain aspects of our U.S. client money movement activity have been subject to regulation at both the federal and individual state levels with resulting inherent complexity across multiple jurisdictions. With the establishment of the Ceridian National Trust Bank, regulatory oversight will now be under the OCC, a single federal government agency.

Our payroll trust structure will continue to benefit our customers by providing bankruptcy-remoteness protection for client funds pending remittance to employees of our clients, tax authorities, and other payees.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in live Dayforce customers, the increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, revenue in 2022 from businesses acquired during 2021, and the increase in float revenue. The number of live Dayforce customers increased 10.3% to 5,993 at December 31, 2022 from 5,434 at December 31, 2021. At the end of 2022, our 5,993 live Dayforce customers represented approximately 5.9 million global employees*. Additionally for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Dayforce recurring revenue per customer grew to $121,425 compared to $108,631 for the comparable period in 2021.

*Excluding the 2021 acquisitions of Ascender and ADAM HCM.

Table of Contents

The increase in Dayforce recurring revenue per customer is driven by our growing global customer base and the growing average size of our customers, as we have been expanding within the enterprise segment. At the end of 2022, enterprise businesses accounted for 51% of the total number of global employees, major businesses accounted for 41% of the total number of global employees, and small businesses accounted for 8% of the total number of global employees.*

The increase in float revenue is driven by the 12.4% increase in average float balance for our customer funds for the year ended December 31, 2022, which increased to $4,370.7 million, compared to $3,889.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, in addition to an increase in average yield of 76 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Cost of revenue. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $773.0 million, an increase of $131.1 million, or 20.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Recurring cost of revenue increased by $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the integration of our APJ acquisitions, specifically $21.0 million of severance and restructuring costs associated with re-balancing our global footprint. Further, the increase in recurring cost of revenue is due to additional costs related to global expansion and costs to support the growing Dayforce customer base. The increase in cost of revenue for professional services and other of $44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to costs incurred to take new customers live.

Product development and management expense increased $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflects additional personnel costs, including share-based compensation and severance. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, our investment in software development was $162.2 million and $131.7 million, respectively, consisting of $92.3 million and $81.1 million of research and development expense, and $69.9 million and $50.6 million of capitalized software development, respectively. Please refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further discussion of our accounting policy for capitalizing internally developed software costs.

Depreciation and amortization expense associated with cost of revenue increased by $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as we continue to capitalize Dayforce related and other development costs and subsequently amortize those costs.

Gross profit and gross margin. Total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $90.9 million, or 23.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the $39.1 million increase in float revenue and total gross margin expansion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

The following table presents total gross margin and solution gross margins for the periods presented:

Cloud recurring gross margin was 72.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 72.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in Cloud recurring gross margin is primarily due to the integration of our APJ acquisitions, specifically a re-balancing of our resources across our global footprint resulting in severance and restructuring costs, partially offset by the increase in float revenue and an increase in the proportion of Dayforce customers live for more than two years, which increased from 80% as of December 31, 2021 to 82% as of December 31, 2022. Bureau recurring gross margin increased from 53.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 60.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflecting higher associated float revenue. Professional services and other gross margin was (20.2)% for the year ended December 31, 2022, declining from (12.2)% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting additional costs incurred to take new customers live, expansion of our capabilities to serve international customers, and increased share-based compensation.

Selling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation and related employer taxes, severance expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and certain other non-recurring items, selling, general, and administrative expenses would have increased $43.6 million. This adjusted increase of $43.6 million was due to increases of $23.5 in general and administrative expense and $20.1 million in sales and marketing expenses, both of which are primarily driven by employee-related costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense represents investment in our sales force in order to support our growth initiatives. Please refer to the "Non-GAAP Measures" section for additional information on the excluded items.

Operating loss. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $25.8 million, compared to $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $9.7 million change was primarily due to the increase in float revenue and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense.

Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $28.6 million, compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $7.3 million decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 in 2022 which eliminated the non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on our Convertible Senior Notes, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on our Term Debt due to the increase in LIBOR rates.

Other expense, net. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other expense, net of $8.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, was comprised of net periodic pension expense and foreign currency translation loss.

Income tax expense (benefit). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had income tax expense of $10.5 million and income tax benefit of $14.9 million, respectively. The $25.4 million increase in tax expense was primarily due to increases of $12.9 million attributed to share-based compensation, $7.1 million attributed to U.S. Global Intangible Low Tax Income regime, and $5.8 million attributed to current operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized. As of December 31, 2022, we will continue to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryovers and tax basis intangibles.

Net loss. Net loss was $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The slight decrease in net loss is primarily due to an increase in revenue, including float revenue, as well as the reduction in interest expense and other expense, partially offset by higher investments in product development and selling capabilities, share-based compensation, further integration of the APJ acquisitions, specifically a re-balancing of our resources across our global footprint, and the non-recurring gain of $19.1 million on the sale of our St. Petersburg, Florida facility in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net profit margin was (5.9)% and (7.4)%, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $87.9 million to $250.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increase in float revenue and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the increase in sales and marketing and product development and management expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.1% in 2022 from 15.9% in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding float revenue, increased $48.8 million to $170.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Please refer to the "Non-GAAP Measures" section for a discussion and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and additional information on the excluded items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from debt issuance and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and equivalents of $431.9 million and there was no amount drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility of $300 million.

Our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements, including the payment of interest and principal on our debt, capital expenditures, product development, and funding Dayforce Wallet on demand pay requests on behalf of our customers. From time to time, we have made investments in businesses or acquisitions of companies. Our total debt balance was $1,234.5 million as of December 31, 2022. Please refer to Note 9, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements and “Our Indebtedness” section below for further information on our debt.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of restricted cash as collateral for bank guarantees. The bank guarantees provide financial assurance that we will fulfill certain lease obligations. The cash is restricted as to withdrawal or use while the related bank guarantee is outstanding.

On February 26, 2021, we elected to borrow $295.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund our acquisition of Ascender on March 1, 2021. We repaid the $295.0 million draw on March 5, 2021 with proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Senior Notes.

In March 2021, we issued $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and issuance costs, were $561.8 million. In connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into capped call transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments we could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Senior Notes. We used an aggregate amount of $45.0 million of the net proceeds of the Convertible Senior Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. We used the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay $295.0 million principal amount under the Revolving Credit Facility and pay related accrued interest and (ii) for general corporate purposes.

On December 15, 2021, we completed the second amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, in which the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended from April 30, 2023 to January 29, 2025.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Dayforce Wallet on demand pay requests are currently funded from our operating cash balances, until it is reimbursed by the customers through their normal payroll funding cycles. We evaluate the creditworthiness of each customer for the Dayforce Wallet feature. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the issuance of equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or a combination thereof. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements and Dayforce Wallet on demand pay requests are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution.

Our customer funds are held and invested with the primary objectives being to protect the principal balance and to ensure adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. The customer assets are held in segregated accounts intended for the specific purpose of satisfying customer funding obligations and therefore are not freely available for our general business use. Please refer to Note 5, "Customer Funds," for further discussion of these funds.

Statements of Cash Flows

Changes in cash flows due to purchases of customer fund marketable securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of customer fund marketable securities, as well as the carrying value of customer fund accounts as of period end dates can vary significantly due to several factors, including the specific day of the week the period ends, which impacts the timing of funds collected from customers and payments made to satisfy customer obligations to employees, taxing authorities, and others. The customer funds are fully segregated from our operating cash accounts and are evaluated and tracked separately by management. The table below summarizes the activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows:

----------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- - ---- - ------- ---- - ------- -
 Year Ended December 31,

Total cash, restricted cash, and equivalents $ 2,604.9 $ 1,952.8 $ 2,228.5

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $132.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $48.8 during the year ended December 31, 2021. For both periods, cash inflows from operating activities are primarily generated from the subscriptions of our solutions. Cash outflows from operating activities for both periods are primarily comprised of personnel-related expenditures that are integral to our business operations. The net positive cash inflow in both periods is primarily due to our growing revenue and collections of such revenue, partially offset by our operating costs, mainly, investment in our sales force to support our growth initiatives and our product development and management costs which are not eligible for capitalization.

Investing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $342.5 million, related to net purchases of customer funds marketable securities of $248.0 million, and capital expenditures of $94.5 million. Our capital expenditures included $74.3 million for software and technology and $20.2 million for property and equipment.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $711.1 million, related to acquisition costs, net of cash acquired, of $409.5 million, net purchase of customer funds marketable securities of $275.8 million, and capital expenditures of $63.7 million. Our capital expenditures included $52.2 million for software and technology and $11.5 million for property and equipment.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $870.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. This cash inflow was primarily attributable to the net increase in our customer funds obligations of $840.1 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation plans of $38.4 million, partially offset by payments on our long-term debt obligations of $8.4 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $407.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. This cash inflow was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Senior Notes of $561.8 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation plans of $95.4 million, partially offset by the net decrease in our customer funds obligations of $195.7 million, purchase of the Capped Calls related to the Convertible Senior Notes of $45.0 million, and payments on our long-term debt obligations of $7.8 million.

Backlog and Seasonality

Backlog is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations, which represents contracted revenue for recurring and fixed price professional services, primarily implementation services, that has not yet been recognized, including deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $1,143.6 million of revenue is expected to be recognized over the next three years from remaining performance obligations.

For a discussion of seasonality, please refer to Part 1, Item I, “Business” of this Form 10-K.

Our Indebtedness

Our primary liquidity needs are related to funding of general business requirements, including the payment of interest and principal on our debt, capital expenditures, product development, and funding Dayforce Wallet on demand pay requests on behalf of our customers. From time to time, we have made investments in businesses or acquisitions of companies, which are also liquidity needs. We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the issuance of equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or a combination thereof. During 2021 and 2020, we incurred additional debt in the form of draws on our Revolving Credit Facility, which was subsequently repaid, and issuance of our Convertible Senior Notes for purposes of either (i) conserving our liquidity position during the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of companies.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

On April 30, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders agreed to provide Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of the Term Debt in the original principal amount of $680.0 million and a $300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility may, at our option, be made available in United States Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros and/or Pounds Sterling; up to $70.0 million may, at our option, be made available for letters of credit and $100.0 million may, at our option, be made available for swingline loans (denominated in Canadian Dollars and/or United States Dollars).

The Term Debt will mature on April 30, 2025. We are required to make annual amortization payments in respect of the Term Debt in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount thereof, payable in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the first lien term debt. On December 15, 2021, we completed the second amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from April 30, 2023 to January 29, 2025. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization payments.

Convertible Senior Notes

In March 2021, we issued $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and issuance costs, were $561.8 million. In connection with the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into capped call transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments we could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. We used an aggregate amount of $45.0 million of the net proceeds of the Convertible Senior Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. We used the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay $295.0 million principal amount under the Revolving Credit Facility and pay related accrued interest and (ii) for general corporate purposes.

For an additional description of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Senior Convertible Notes, please refer to Note 9, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations

Our future contractual obligations generally consist of long-term debt, leases, retirement plans, and vendor payments. Our long-term debt obligations are described in Note 9, “Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements, and the “Our Indebtedness” section above.

As of December 31, 2022, all of our facilities are leased. Most of these leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes, insurance, and maintenance. We also lease equipment for use in our business. We ceased use of certain leased facilities during 2021 and 2020 and recognized lease abandonment charges within our consolidated statements of operations; however, we are still required to make future payments under the existing lease terms. Refer to Note 15, "Leases," to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our leases.

Payments of retirement plan obligations include employer commitments to fund our defined benefit and postretirement plans and do not include estimated future benefit payments to participants expected to be made from liquidation of the assets in our defined benefit plan trusts. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we contributed $105.0 million to our largest U.S. pension plan, satisfying all expected contributions for the foreseeable future for this defined benefit plan. As of December 31, 2022, our defined benefit pension plans had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by $11.1 million and our postretirement benefit plan had a projected benefit obligation that exceeded the fair value of the plans’ assets by $8.8 million. We expect to satisfy these remaining obligations through investment income from and appreciation in the fair value of plan assets and from future employer contributions. Refer to Note 10, "Employee Benefit Plans," to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our employee benefit plans.

The amount of our future contractual obligation to vendors as of December 31, 2022 was not material.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following is our critical accounting estimate:

Revenue Recognition

Description: We recognize revenue for professional services and Cloud subscription services performance obligations based on an allocation of the total transaction price to each performance obligation using the respective stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). This can result in revenue being recognized in an amount that exceeds the amount we are contractually allowed to bill our customer as of a certain point in time, resulting in the recognition of a contract asset up until the period at which billings are equal to or exceed revenue recognition. We recognized $182.4 million of Cloud professional services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related contract assets were $68.5 million as of December 31, 2022.

Judgments and Uncertainties: The determination of our stand-alone selling price for the performance obligations requires us to make assumptions based on market conditions and observable inputs, as well as an estimate of the total professional service hours expected to be incurred in connection with each customer implementation.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The consideration allocated to professional services performed to activate a new customer is recognized as professional services revenues based on the proportion of total work performed to date compared to an estimation of total work expected to complete the implementation project for that customer account. To the extent this consideration exceeds the customer billings, a contract asset would be recognized, as professional services revenue related to implementation activities is generally recognized at the beginning of the contract.

Please refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for a description of our revenue recognition policy and our significant accounting policies.

Non-GAAP Measures

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted net income per share, revenue on a constant currency basis, Cloud ARR, Annual Dayforce revenue retention rate, and Dayforce recurring revenue per customer. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance including comparison across periods and with competitors. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance because these measures exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations, and are used for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes both for short- and long-term operating plans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required by, defined under, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to our results as reported under GAAP, have important limitations as analytical tools, and our use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation.

We define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

•
EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gains (losses), share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, and certain other non-recurring items.

•
Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage that Adjusted EBITDA is of total revenue.

•
Adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit (loss), as adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gains (losses), share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other non-recurring items.

•
Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss), as adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gains (losses), share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other non-recurring items, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes.

•
Adjusted diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. When adjusted diluted net income per share is positive, diluted weighted average common shares outstanding incorporate the effect of dilutive equity instruments.

•
Revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate in effect during the comparable prior period.

•
Cloud ARR is calculated by starting with recurring revenue at year end, excluding revenue from Ascender and ADAM HCM, subtracting the once-a-year charges, annualizing the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year, and adding back the once-a-year charges. We have not reconciled Cloud ARR because there is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

•
Annual Dayforce revenue retention rate is calculated as a percentage, excluding Ascender and ADAM HCM, where the numerator is the Dayforce ARR for the prior year, less the Dayforce ARR from lost Dayforce customers during that year; and the denominator is the Dayforce ARR for the prior year. We have not reconciled Annual Dayforce revenue retention rate because there is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

•
Dayforce recurring revenue per customer is an indicator of the average size of Dayforce recurring revenue customers. To calculate Dayforce recurring revenue per customer, we start with Dayforce recurring revenue on a constant currency basis by applying the same exchange rate to all comparable periods for the trailing twelve months and excludes float revenue, the impact of lower employment levels in 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Ascender and ADAM HCM revenue. This amount is divided by the number of live Dayforce customers at the end of the trailing twelve month period, excluding Ascender and ADAM HCM. We have not reconciled the Dayforce recurring revenue per customer because there is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

(e)
Net profit margin is determined by calculating the percentage that net loss is of total revenue.

The Adjusted column is a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted to exclude foreign exchange gains (losses), share-based compensation expense and related employer taxes, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and other non-recurring items, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes.

(c)
Income tax effects have been calculated based on the statutory tax rates in effect in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions during the period.

(d)
Both GAAP and Adjusted net income (loss) per share are calculated by dividing either GAAP or Adjusted net income by the basic or diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. When adjusted diluted net income per share is positive, diluted weighted average common shares outstanding incorporate the effect of dilutive equity instruments. GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share are calculated based upon 152,940,299 weighted-average shares of common stock and Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share are calculated based upon 152,940,299 and 155,802,557 weighted-average shares of common stock, respectively.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

Our Business Model

Our business model focuses on supporting the rapid growth of Dayforce and maximizing the lifetime value of our Dayforce customer relationships. Due to our subscription model, where we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period, and our it takes approximately two years before we are able to recover our implementation, customer acquisition, and other direct costs on a new Dayforce customer contract.

Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, customers that do not currently utilize our full suite of capabilities. We also incur costs to manage the account, to retain customers, and to sell additional functionality. These costs, however, are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire and to take customers live.

Revenues

We generate recurring revenues primarily from recurring fees charged for the use of our Cloud solutions, income as float revenue.

For Dayforce, we primarily charge monthly recurring fees on a PEPM basis, generally one-month in advance of service, based on the number and type of solutions provided to the ranges from three months for smaller customers to twelve months for larger customers. We begin to generate recurring revenue when we provide a production instance to the customer. We also provide outsourced payroll processing, time and labor management, performance management, and recruiting, as needed.

The Powerpay offering serves our small market Canadian customers. The typical Powerpay customer has fewer and delivery of customers’ remittance advices or checks. Powerpay can typically be implemented on a remote basis within one to three days, at which point we start receiving recurring fees.

For our Bureau We also perform individual services for customers, such as check printing, wage attachment and disbursement, and ACA management.

Operating loss. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $25.8 million, compared to $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $9.7 million change was primarily due to the increase in float revenue and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense.

Interest expense, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 in 2022 which eliminated the non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on our Convertible Senior Notes, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on our Term Debt due to the increase in LIBOR rates.

Other expense, net. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other expense, net of $8.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, was comprised of net periodic pension expense and foreign currency translation loss.

Income tax expense (benefit). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had income tax expense of $10.5 million and income tax benefit of $14.9 million, respectively. The $25.4 million increase in tax expense was primarily due to increases of $12.9 million attributed to share-based compensation, loss carryovers and tax basis intangibles.

Net loss. Net loss was $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
