Recent Developments

               On October 28, 2022, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our Energy business to Planet Jersey Buyer Ltd, an entity that was formed on behalf of, and is controlled by, The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and its affiliated funds and entities (“Veritas Capital”), for a purchase price of $3,100.0 million (subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital and indebtedness of the Energy business as of the closing) and up to $200 million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital’s future return on its investment paid through a Class C Partnership interest. This transaction closed on February 1, 2023. The Energy business qualified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was classified as a discontinued operation per the guidance in ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and as held for sale assets and liabilities on our balance sheet for all periods presented.

On February 1, 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire Mavera for a net cash purchase price of $29.3 million, of which $4.2 million represents indemnity escrows. Mavera is a Sweden-based InsurTech firm with a strong regional presence and established customer base for its personal injury claims management platform. Mavera will support our expansion in continental Europe and its continued growth as a technology and analytics partner to the global insurance industry.

On January 17, 2023 and February 1, 2023, we made repayments of $20 million and $970 million, respectively, under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As a result of this activity, we now have the ability to draw up to $995.6 million from our Syndicated Credit Facility.

Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the outstanding borrowings under the Bilateral Term Loan Facility of $125.0 million and the Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility of $275.0 million were repaid.

Executive Summary

Key Performance Metrics

Revenue growth. We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.

We believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy. We use year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth as metrics to measure our performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective nearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in the use of EBITDA are:

• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.

• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.

• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

EBITDA growth. We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.

EBITDA margin. We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.

Revenues

Our Insurance segment provides underwriting and ratings, and claims insurance data for the U.S. P&C insurance industry. This segment's revenues represented approximately 98% and 90% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our customers in this segment include most of the P&C insurance providers in the U.S. Our former Energy and Specialized Markets segment no longer includes the Energy business as it was classified as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Energy and Specialized Markets segment consists of our environmental health and safety business, which was sold on March 11, 2022. Our former Energy and Specialized Markets segment's revenues represented approximately 1% and 5% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our former Financial Services segment provided competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms, business intelligence, and customized analytic services to financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators and merchants. Our former Financial Services segment's revenues represented approximately 1% and 5% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions, recurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. Approximately 81% of the revenues in our Insurance segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements (generally one to five years) for our solutions.

We also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 19% of our consolidated revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions.

Principal Operating Costs and Expenses

Personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses, which represented approximately 59.2% and 56.3% of ourtotal operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to dispositions) for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.

We assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.

While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion.

Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance, and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.

Trends Affecting Our Business

A significant change in P&C insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions. For insurers, the keys to profitability include increasing investment income, premium growth and disciplined and accurate underwriting of risks. Growth in P&C insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 5.1% in 2019. In 2020, industry premium growth declined to 2.3% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct premium growth accelerated to 9.5% in 2021 indicating a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the most recent results available, direct written premiums continued to grow in 2022. As the pandemic related issues continue winding down, new economic concerns such as inflation and rising interest rates have risen to the fore. Despite increasing interest rates in 2022, the annualized yield on investments (not attributable to cash transfers from outside the P/C industry) is 2.5% as of nine-months 2022, down from the 2.6% yield for year-end 2021. Both recent results are lower than the historical 15-year average of 3.4%, showing that yields have yet to follow the trend in interest rates.

From 2020 to 2022, insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses associated with a record number of events that ISO's Property Claims Service had classified as catastrophes. The catastrophes of 2020 included hurricane Laura and the Midwest derecho, as well as multiple wildfires in the Western states, while the most notable events of 2021 included the winter storm in February that left much of Texas without power and Hurricane Ida in August. Calendar year 2022 was marked by Hurricane Ian in September, the deadliest hurricane to strike Florida since 1935. All three of these hurricanes - Laura, Ida, and Ian - are among the strongest hurricanes to ever make landfall in the United States. In Florida specifically, the high overall claim risk, as evidenced by Ian, combined with the litigious environment poses an even greater risk to insurers who have faced two consecutive years with significant net underwriting losses. In California, the Department of Insurance enacted regulations for wildfire mitigation discounts in rating plans and wildfire risk models in response to an insurance affordability crisis in wildfire prone areas. We continue to provide the necessary coverages and data and analytics to meet the changing needs of communities, regulators and insurers as illustrated by these events.

In response to rising inflation, carriers are working to reset pricing to fix loss ratios and improve profitability. This has slowed their marketing spend for customer acquisition. Until premium pricing adjustments take effect and profitability improves, carriers are refraining from spending to drive new policy volume, creating short term impacts on demand and volume for our Marketing Solutions offerings and auto underwriting solutions.

Trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses (such as from weather, climate, casualty, terrorism, pandemics, and tsunamis) can have an effect on our customers’ profitability, and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of these events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. We also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity. The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.

In the life insurance market, carriers are looking to modernize and digitize their core platforms, as well as offer streamlined underwriting decision-making process to expand the number of policies, which can be offered more rapidly, and without cumbersome medical tests. Our no-code modular technology stack and advanced analytics (such as using electronic health records to model mortality and detecting of tobacco use through voice analysis) enable the digital transformation of our customers' core infrastructure and automate their decision-making processes across the policy lifecycle.

Description of Acquisitions

We acquired thirteen businesses since January 1, 2020. These acquisitions affect the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between periods. See a description of our 2022 acquisitions below and Note 10. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.

On March 1, 2022, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of Opta Information Intelligence Corp. ("Opta") for a net cash purchase price of $217.5 million excluding working capital adjustments, of which $0.8 million represents indemnity escrows. Opta, a leading provider of property intelligence and innovative technology solutions in Canada, has become a part of the underwriting & rating category within our Insurance segment. We believe this acquisition further expands our footprint in the Canadian market and supports Verisk in reshaping risk management with valuable business intelligence.

On February 11, 2022, we acquired 100 percent of the membership interest of Infutor Data Solutions ("Infutor") for a net cash purchase price of $220.7 million excluding working capital adjustments, of which $1.5 million represents a working capital escrow, plus a contingent earn-out payment of up to $25.0 million subject to the achievement of certain revenue and other performance targets. Infutor, a leading provider of identity resolution and consumer intelligence data, has become part of the underwriting & rating category within our Insurance segment. We believe this acquisition further enhances Verisk's marketing solutions offerings to companies across several industries, including the insurance industry.

Description of Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

See a description of our 2022 dispositions and businesses held for sale below and Note 11. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.

          As described above, we completed the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023.  The Energy business qualified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was classified as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and as held for sale on the balance sheet for all periods presented.

On April 8, 2022, the sale of Verisk Financial Services, our Financial Services segment, to TransUnion, a global information and insights company, was completed for net cash proceeds of $498.3 million. An impairment loss of $73.7 million and a loss on the sale of $15.6 million were included in "Other operating (income) loss" within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended 2022, respectively. We had a $134.0 million impairment to the long-lived assets for our Financial Services reporting unit including $88.2 million to intangible assets and $45.8 million to fixed assets for the year ended 2021. We assessed the sale of our Financial Services segment per the guidance in ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, and determined that this transaction did not qualify as a discontinued operation as its total revenues and assets did not meet the thresholds exemplified in the guidance, quantitatively or qualitatively, to represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Verisk Financial Services generated revenue of $37.6 million in 2022.

On March 11, 2022, the sale of our environmental health and safety business ("3E Company Environmental, Ecological and Engineering") within the Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was completed for proceeds of $575.0 million, net of cash and excluding contingent consideration. In the first quarter of 2022, we recognized a gain of $450.8 million. The major classes of assets and liabilities disposed of, reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of March 11, 2022. We assessed the sale of our environmental health and safety business per the guidance in ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, and determined that this transaction did not qualify as a discontinued operation as its total revenues and assets did not meet the thresholds exemplified in the guidance, quantitatively or qualitatively, to represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Revenues

Revenues were $2,497.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2,462.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $34.5 million or 1.4%. Our recent acquisitions (Data Driven Safety, LLC, Infutor Data Solutions, LLC, and Opta Information Intelligence Corp. within the underwriting & rating category of the Insurance segment, ACTINEO GmbH, Automated Insurance Solutions Ltd. and Pruvan Inc., within the claims category of the Insurance segment) and dispositions (the Specialized Markets segment and the Financial Services segment) reduced net revenues by $93.8 million. The remaining growth in consolidated revenues of $128.3 million or 5.8% is related to increased revenues within our Insurance segment. Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for more information regarding our revenues.

 2022 2021 Percentage change Percentage change excluding recent acquisitions, businesses held for sale and disposition

Financial Services 37.6 142.8 (73.7 )% — %
Total revenues $ 2,497.0 $ 2,462.5 1.4 % 5.8 %

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues was $824.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $853.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an decrease of $29.1 million or 3.4%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for a net decrease of $54.9 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining cost of revenues of $25.8 million or 3.6% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $15.0 million, information technology expenses of $13.6 million and travel expenses of $3.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in data costs of $4.7 million, professional consulting fees of $0.9 million and other operating cost of $0.7 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SGA") were $381.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $313.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $68.3 million or 21.8%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $13.7 million in SGA primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. Our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) accounted for a decrease of $3.6 million (See Note 10. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The remaining SGA increase of $58.2 million or 21.3% was primarily due to increases in professional consulting costs of $49.2 million, travel expenses of $4.6 million, salaries and employee benefits of $4.2 million and information technology expenses of $0.4 million. The increase in professional consulting costs is primarily due to the release of the previously established Xactware Solutions Patent Litigation's ("EVT Litigation Reserve") reserve once the final payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2021 (the original accrual for this matter was recorded as part of SGA). These increases were partially offset by decreases of other operating costs of $0.2 million.

Depreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets

Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $164.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $170.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $6.1 million or 3.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by recent dispositions of $20.5 million, partially offset by $13.1 million attributed to assets placed into service to support data capacity expansion and revenue growth and $1.3 million related to recent acquisitions.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets was $74.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5.5 million or 6.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by recent dispositions of $20.1 million, and intangible assets that were fully amortized of $8.6 million, partially offset by additional amortization of intangible assets incurred in connection with our recent acquisitions of $23.2 million.

 Other Operating (Income)Loss

Other operating income was a gain of $354.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss of $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase of $488.2 million was primarily related to the net gain from our dispositions within our former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments.

Investment (Loss)Income and Others, Net

Investment (loss)income and others, net was a loss of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gain of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $11.8 million or 9.3%. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates on our Syndicated Credit Facility, and the addition of a Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by the maturity of our 4.125% senior notes.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $220.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $40.9 million or 22.8%. The effective tax rate was 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a tax rate benefit in connection with the sale of our environmental health and safety business for which a benefit was recognized for the difference between book and tax basis of our investment. The 2022 rate was also lower than 2021 due to a $30.3 million release of a United Kingdom valuation allowance related to interest expense utilization and a reduced Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI") inclusion in the current period versus the prior period, partially offset by reduced stock option exercises resulting in lower tax benefits from equity compensation in the current period versus the prior period.

Net Income Margin

The net income margin for our consolidated results was 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 24.7% for each of the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net income margin was primarily related to the net gain from the sale of our environmental health and safety business and the Financial Services segment in addition to an impairment of our Financial Services segment in 2021.

EBITDA Margin [1]

The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 65.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 47.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in EBITDA margin was primarily related to the net gain from our dispositions within our former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments. The increase in EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the net gain from the sale of our environmental health and safety business and the Financial Services segment, which positively impacted our margin by 14.2%.

[1] Note: Consolidated EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue. A reconciliation from net income to EBITDA is in the table below:

Results of Continuing Operations by Segment

Our Energy and Specialized Market segment was comprised of two businesses, our Energy business and Specialized Market business. On March 11, 2022, we completed the sale of 3E Company Environmental, Ecological and Engineering, which made up the Specialized Markets within this segment. This transaction did not qualify as a discontinued operation. The Energy business qualified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was classified as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. On February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business.

On April 8, 2022, we completed the sale of Verisk Financial Services, our Financial Services segment, to TransUnion. This transaction did not qualify as a discontinued operation.

As a result of these sale transactions, we have excluded the Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services segments from our management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations by segment. See a description of our 2022 dispositions and businesses held for sale below and Note 11. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.

Our recent acquisitions (Data Driven Safety, LLC, Infutor Data Solutions, LLC, and Opta Information Intelligence Corp. within the underwriting & rating category of the Insurance segment, ACTINEO GmbH, Automated Insurance Solutions Ltd. and Pruvan Inc., within the claims category of the Insurance segment) contributed net revenues of $101.8 million, while the remaining Insurance revenues increased $128.3 million or 5.8%. Our underwriting & rating revenues increased $91.8 million or 5.9% primarily due to an annual increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the content of the solutions within our industry-standard insurance programs as well as selling expanded solutions to existing customers within commercial and personal lines. In addition, catastrophe modeling services contributed to the growth. Our claims revenues increased $36.5 million or 5.6%, primarily due to growth in our repair cost estimating solutions revenue and claims analytics revenue related to annual price as well as volume increases.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Insurance segment was $781.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $704.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $77.5 million or 11.0%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions represented a net increase of $51.7 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining increase in cost of revenues of $25.8 million or 3.6% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $15.0 million, information technology expenses of $13.6 million and travel expenses of $3.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in data costs of $4.7 million, professional consulting fees of $0.9 million and other operating cost of $0.7 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SGA expenses for our Insurance segment were $347.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $239.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $108.3 million or 45.3%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $53.7 million primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. Our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) accounted for a decrease of $3.6 million. The remaining increase in SGA of $58.2 million or 21.3% was primarily due to increases in professional consulting costs of $49.2 million, travel expenses of $4.6 million, salaries and employee benefits of $4.2 million and information technology expenses of $0.4 million. The increase in professional consulting costs is primarily due to the release of the previously established EVT Litigation Reserve once the final payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2021 (the original accrual for this matter was recorded as part of SGA). These increases were partially offset by decreases of other operating costs of $0.2 million.

Investment (Loss) Income and Others, Net

Investment (loss) income and others, net was a loss of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gain of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.

EBITDA

EBITDA for our Insurance segment was $1,303.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,265.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The EBITDA margin for our Insurance segment was 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 57.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily due to the release of the previously established EVT Litigation Reserve during the fourth quarter of 2021.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Revenues

Revenues were $2,462.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,269.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $193.1 million or 8.5%. Our recent acquisitions (Franco Signor, Jornaya, Whitespace, Ignite Software Systems, Data Driven Safety within the underwriting & rating category of the Insurance segment, and ACTINEO within the claims category of the Insurance segment) and dispositions (the aerial imagery sourcing group and the compliance background screening business within the claims category of the Insurance segment and the data warehouse business within the Financial Services segment) increased net revenues by $50.9 million. The remaining growth in consolidated revenues of $142.2 million or 6.3% is primarily related to increased revenues within our Insurance segment. Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for more information regarding our revenues.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenues was $853.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $791.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $62.0 million or 7.8%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for a net increase of $12.3 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining cost of revenues of $49.7 million or 6.3% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $26.7 million, information technology expenses of $17.6 million, professional consulting fees of $2.4 million, data cost of $0.7 million and other operating cost of $3.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel expense of $1.3 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SGA") were $313.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $308.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.0 million or 1.6%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $14.6 million in SGA primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. Our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) accounted for a decrease of $2.0 million (See Note 10. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K). The remaining SGA decrease of $7.6 million or 2.5% was primarily due to decreases in professional consulting costs of $37.9 million, travel expenses of $1.4 million and other operating cost of $0.2 million. The decrease in professional consulting costs is primarily due to the release of the previously established Xactware Solutions Patent Litigation's ("EVT Litigation Reserve") reserve once the final payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2021 (the original accrual for this matter was recorded as part of SGA). These decreases were partially offset by increases of salaries and employee benefits of $28.2 million and information technology expenses of $3.8 million.

Depreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets

Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $170.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $159.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $11.0 million or 6.9%. The increase was primarily attributed to $11.8 million assets placed into service to support data capacity expansion and revenue growth and $0.4 million related to recent acquisitions, partially offset by recent dispositions of $1.2 million.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets was $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.5 million or 9.0%. This increase was primarily driven by the additional amortization of intangible assets incurred in connection with our recent acquisitions of $11.2 million, partially offset by intangible assets that were fully amortized of $4.5 million and our recent dispositions of $0.2 million.

Other Operating Income(Loss)

Other operating income was a loss of $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a gain of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease of $153.6 million was primarily related to the long-lived impairment loss associated with our Financial Services segment recorded in the current period and gains associated with the dispositions of our compliance background screening business and data warehouse business that were recorded in 2020.

Investment (Loss)Income and Others, Net

Investment (loss) income and others, net was a gain of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $11.3 million or 8.2%. We repaid our 5.800% senior notes in May 2021, which contributed to a lower interest expense.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $14.8 million or 9.0%. The effective tax rate was 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 20.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the deferred tax impact of the tax rate increase in the United Kingdom that was enacted and recorded in 2021 and the impact of higher tax benefits from equity compensation in the prior period versus the current period.

Net Income Margin

The net income margin for our consolidated results was 24.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 28.8% for each of the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net income margin was primarily related to the long-lived asset impairment loss associated with our Financial Services segment.

EBITDA Margin [1]

The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 47.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 52.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in EBITDA margin was primarily related to the long-lived asset impairment loss associated with our Financial Services segment, partially offset by the release of the previously established EVT Litigation Reserve once the final payment was made in December 2021.

[1] Note: Consolidated EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue. A reconciliation from net income to EBITDA is in the table below:

Claims 651.8 595.7 9.4 % 7.5 %
Total Insurance $ 2,206.9 $ 2,008.7 9.9 % 7.3 %

Our recent acquisitions (Franco Signor, Jornaya, Whitespace, Ignite Software Systems, and Data Driven Safety within the underwriting & rating category and ACTINEO within the claims category) and dispositions (the aerial imagery sourcing group and the compliance background screening business within the claims category) contributed net revenues of $52.2 million, while the remaining Insurance revenues increased $146.0 million or 7.3%. Our underwriting & rating revenues increased $101.7 million or 7.2% primarily due to an annual increase in prices derived from continued enhancements to the content of the solutions within our industry-standard insurance programs as well as selling expanded solutions to existing customers within commercial and personal lines. In addition, catastrophe modeling services contributed to the growth. Our claims revenues increased $44.3 million or 7.5%, primarily due to growth in our repair cost estimating solutions revenue and claims analytics revenue related to annual price as well as volume increases.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Insurance segment was $704.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $644.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $60.0 million or 9.3%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions represented a net increase of $13.0 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining increase in cost of revenues of $47.0 million or 7.4% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $25.4 million, information technology expenses of $16.5 million, professional consulting fees of $2.9 million, data cost of $2.0 million and other operating cost of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel expense of $0.6 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses for our Insurance segment were $239.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $248.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $9.0 million or 3.6%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $15.1 million primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. Our acquisition-related costs (earn-outs) accounted for a decrease of $2.0 million. The remaining decrease in SGA of $22.1 million or 9.1% was primarily due to decreases in professional consulting costs of $42.2 million, travel expenses of $1.2 million and other operating cost of $0.7 million. The decrease in professional consulting fees was primarily due to the release of the previously established EVT Litigation Reserve once the final payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2021 (the original accrual for this matter was recorded as part of SGA). These decreases were partially offset by increases of salaries and employee benefits of $19.5 million and information technology expenses of $2.6 million.

Investment (loss) income and others, net was a gain of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a gain of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The gain was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.

EBITDA

EBITDA for our Insurance segment was $1,265.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,132.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The EBITDA margin for our Insurance segment was 57.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 56.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to the release of the previously established EVT Litigation Reserve once the final payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2021, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19, and cost discipline.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $296.7 million and $285.3 million, respectively, inclusive of cash included within assets held for sale. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Syndicated Credit Facility (as defined below) and the Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital, human capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.

We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.

Our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were 8.1% and 8.5%, respectively. Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, “Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, “Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.”

We have historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we repurchased $1,662.5 million, $475.0 million and $348.8 million, respectively, of our common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we also paid dividends of $195.2 million, $188.2 million, and $175.8 million, respectively.

Financing and Financing Capacity

We had total debt, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs of $3,740.0 million and $3,310.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2020, 2019 and 2015 and borrowings outstanding under our committed senior unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility ("Syndicated Credit Facility"), described below, our bilateral revolving credit facility (“Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility”) and our bilateral term loan credit facility (“Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility”).  Together, the Syndicated Credit Facility, the Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility, the Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility are referred to as our “Credit Facilities”. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "Long-term debt" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K over the life of the respective senior note. The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. As of December 31, 2022, we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,350.0 million outstanding, and we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial debt covenants.

We have a $1,000.0 million Syndicated Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., First Commercial Bank, Ltd., Los Angeles Branch, TD Bank, N.A., and the Northern Trust Company. The financial covenants thereunder require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.5 to 1.0. At our election, the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase one time each to 4.0 to 1.0 and 4.25 to 1.0. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and the share repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the available capacity under the Syndicated Credit Facility was $5.6 million and $384.9 million, net of the letters of credit of $4.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2022 we have made repayments of $990.0 million under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As a result of this activity, we now have the ability to draw up to $995.6 million from our Syndicated Credit Facility.

On March 11, 2022, we entered into a $125.0 million Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A with an agreed maturity date of September 12, 2022. On September 9, 2022, we amended the Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility to provide a one-year extension with an agreed maturity date of September 9, 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repaid the full $125.0 million outstanding principal amount under our Bilateral Term Loan Credit Facility agreement.

On September 9, 2022 we also added a 364-day $275.0 million Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility to be available starting October 3, 2022. The Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility carry an interest rate of 135 basis points plus the one-month BSBY margin at the time. The Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. In December 2022, we borrowed $275.0 million on the Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility, of which $250.0 million was utilized for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repaid the full $275.0 million outstanding principal amount under our Bilateral Revolving Credit Facility.

Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.4 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized in a five-step model: 1) identify the contract with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term. Revenues from certain discrete project based advisory/consulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, based on the input method of consulting hours worked; this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer. Revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time.

We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments. Amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation cost, including stock options, restricted stock, and performance share units ("PSUs"), is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of PSUs is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.

Option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. PSUs are generally expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period. We follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after January 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.

We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.

Goodwill and Intangibles

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.

As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill from continuing operations of $1,676.0 million, which represents 24.1% of our total assets. During 2022, we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2022 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Subsequent to performing our annual impairment test, we continued to monitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; other than the impairment of the Energy business that was triggered once the entity was classified as held for sale, we did not identify any other triggering events. There are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, EBITDA, EBITDA margins and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates, and an estimate of value using multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies applied to such expected cash flows and market approaches in order to estimate fair value. We have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units. To mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties. The determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill.

In connection with the held for sale classification of the Energy business, we recognized an impairment of $303.7 million, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $75.9 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within shareholders' equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment.

Due to the deterioration in the performance of our former Financial Services reporting unit and the finalization of the sale price, we reassessed the recoverability of these long-lived assets during the first quarter of 2022, resulting in a $73.7 million impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a $134.0 million impairment to the long-lived assets for our Financial Services reporting unit including $88.2 million to intangible assets and $45.8 million to fixed assets. These impairments are included within "Other operating income, net" in our consolidated statements of operations.

We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third-party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.

Pension and Postretirement

 Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.

 In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans. Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date. The outputs from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices. For our pension plans at December 31, 2022, we determined this rate to be 5.49%, an increase of 2.74% from the 2.75% rate used at December 31, 2021. Our postretirement rate was 5.25% at December 31, 2022 an increase of 3.00% from the 2.25% rate used at December 31, 2021.

The expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 55% debt securities and 45% equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, the pension plan assets were allocated 52.9% debt securities, 41.4% equity securities, 5.0% real estate and 0.7% other. The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt securities. We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. We amortize, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For our pension and postretirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2022 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $147.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and we expect to recognize a net periodic pension and postretirement expenses of $5.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in 2023 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.

A one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:

 Pension Postretirement

Expected Rate of Return on Assets $ 4.4 $ - $ (4.4 ) $ - $ 0.1 $ - $ (0.1 ) $ -

Income Taxes

In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.

We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of ASC 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.

We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.

We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.9 million that may be recognized by December 31, 2023, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.

As of December 31, 2022, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $85.3 million, which will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2042. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:

Years Ending (In millions)

2023 - 2030 $ 20.8
2031 - 2035 11.7
2036 - 2042 52.8
Total $ 85.3

The net deferred income tax liability of $114.0 million consists primarily of timing differences involving amortization.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $296.7 million and $285.3 million, respectively, inclusive of cash included within assets held for sale. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated significant below), we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital, human capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.

We have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.

Our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were 8.1% and 8.5%, respectively. Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, “Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” We also capitalize amounts in accordance with ASC 985-20, “Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.”

We have historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we repurchased $1,662.5 million, $475.0 million and $348.8 million, respectively, of our common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we also paid dividends of $195.2 million, $188.2 million, and $175.8 million, respectively.

Financing and Financing Capacity

We had total debt, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs of $3,740.0 million and $3,310.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The debt at December 31, 2022 primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2020, 2019 and 2015 and borrowings outstanding under our committed senior unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility ("]:
