Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included herein. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 for that discussion.

Overview
The Company is a global leader providing Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other workflow automation products and services. The Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this document for additional information.

•The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels and services.

•The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, workflow optimization solutions and location solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions.

During the past year, we have maintained our position as a market leader in our core businesses, which are generally considered to be comprised of our mobile computing and data capture products, printing products and supplies, as well as support and repair services. Customers across the industries that we serve have benefited from our core offerings to keep pace with the increasingly on-demand economy and to invest in their long-term technology capabilities.

The Company has continued to make strategic investments to accelerate progress in certain adjacent and expansion markets. In June 2022, the Company acquired Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. (“Matrox) for $881 million in cash, net of Matrox’s cash on-hand. Matrox, part of our EVM segment, is a leading provider of advanced machine vision components and software serving many end-markets. Through its acquisition of Matrox, the Company significantly expanded its machine vision products and software offerings. The Company also continues to focus on scaling and integrating our other recent acquisitions (Antuit.ai, Fetch Robotics, Adaptive Vision Sp. z.o.o., and Reflexis) providing growth opportunities across our software and robotic solution offerings. These investments were funded partly through cash flow generation from our core businesses operations as well as through borrowings and other working capital facilities that enable us to maintain strong liquidity and manageable debt leverage.

As part of our ongoing supply chain optimization and resiliency initiatives, we extended the transition timeline of our distribution center in North America. The transition negatively impacted product fulfillment and operating results in the third quarter and contributed to elevated inventory levels. To mitigate the impacts associated with that transition, we resumed servicing customer orders through our existing logistics service provider. Additionally, in January 2023, we terminated our contractual arrangement with the new service provider and have directly assumed the distribution center lease and have staffed the facility with Zebra employees, hence assuming all operational activities at the location.

We are actively managing our inventory levels and have been addressing certain component part shortages through a combination of entering long-term supply commitments with key vendors, utilizing expedited modes of transportation, as well as executing select product re-designs. We anticipate inventory levels to remain elevated from historical levels as we continue to manage through supply chain challenges.

Macroeconomic Environment

The acceleration of broad global cost inflation, a rising interest rate environment, and a stronger U.S. dollar in the current year have negatively impacted our operating results. We have partially mitigated the financial impacts of these headwinds through a combination of targeted price increases, as well as our ongoing foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk management programs. We believe that this challenging operating environment, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia/Ukraine war, has contributed to a deceleration of certain customer demand, particularly late in the current year. The Company expects these macro conditions to persist into 2023.

Table of Contents
In the first quarter of 2022, we announced the suspension of our business operations in Russia. Neither Russia nor Ukraine comprises a material portion of our business; therefore, the war thus far has not had a significant effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the war has not significantly affected our ability to source supplies or deliver our products and services to our customers in the surrounding EMEA region. We will continue to monitor this for potential future adverse impacts on our business.

In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant declines in customer demand and supply chain disruptions, which negatively impacted the Company’s Net sales and overall profitability. In 2021, customer demand sharply rebounded as the underlying trend to digitize and automate workflows accelerated, which, along with pent-up demand from customers who we believe previously delayed purchases due to the pandemic, benefited the Company’s 2021 sales and profitability. The level of demand for certain product components resulted in lengthened lead times, component shortages, and higher input costs, including freight and component parts. Component shortages for certain products and elevated input costs continued in 2022 which negatively impacted our ability to meet customer demand and our operating results.

2022 Financial Highlights and Other Recent Developments

•Net sales were $5,781 million in the current year compared to $5,627 million in the prior year.
•Operating income was $529 million in the current year compared to $979 million in the prior year.
•Net income was $463 million, or $8.80 per diluted share in the current year, compared to Net income of $837 million, or $15.52 per diluted share in the prior year.
•Operating cash flow was $488 million in the current year compared to $1,069 million in the prior year.
•We repurchased $751 million of common shares in the current year compared to $57 million in the prior year.

Restructuring Activity
In the third quarter of 2022, the Company committed to certain organizational changes and leased site rationalization actions designed to generate structural cost efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2022 Productivity Plan”). The total cost under the 2022 Productivity Plan, which is expected to be completed in 2023, is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Exit and restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan were $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company incurred Exit and restructuring costs, under previously announced programs of $2 million, $7 million, and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

License and Settlement Agreement
On June 30, 2022, the Company announced it entered into a License and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) resulting in a $372 million pre-tax charge, inclusive of $12 million of external legal fees, within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the Settlement, Zebra agreed to pay $360 million to the counterparty in eight quarterly payments of $45 million which began in the second quarter. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 14, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments, and Contingencies for additional information.

Change in Segments
In the first quarter of 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of RTLS and services that generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of high-valued assets, equipment, and people, moved from our AIT segment into our EVM segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical periods, on a comparable basis. This change did not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)For purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions.
(3)Consolidated Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.

2022 compared to 2021
Total Net sales increased $154 million or 2.7% compared to the prior year as our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows. Net sales grew across both of our segments and most of our regions. Current year Net sales of both segments were negatively impacted by supply chain bottlenecks, which were particularly pronounced in our EVM segment. Prior year Net sales of both segments benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the effects of currency changes and acquisitions, the increase in Consolidated Organic Net sales was 3.2%.

Gross margin decreased to 45.4% for the current year compared to 46.7% in the prior year. Gross margins were lower in both of our segments. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, unfavorable business mix, and lower support service margins, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.

Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2,095 million and $1,649 million, or 36.2% and 29.3% of Net sales, respectively. Excluding the Settlement charge, Operating expenses were 29.8% of Net sales in the current year, with an increase over the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses, and increased employee travel, which were partially offset by lower employee incentive-based compensation.

Operating income was $529 million for the current year compared to $979 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the Settlement charge.

Net income decreased 44.7% compared to the prior year due to lower Operating income and a higher income tax rate, which were partially offset by favorability in Other income (expense), net as follows:

•Other income (expense), net was income of $15 million for the current year, compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year primarily due to the current year benefiting from an $83 million gain on interest rate swaps compared to a $13 million gain in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average outstanding debt levels and interest rates in the current year.

•The Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 14.9% and 13.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities, unfavorable return to provision adjustments, and lower share-based compensation deductions.

Diluted earnings per share decreased to $8.80 as compared to $15.52 in the prior year due to lower Net income, partially offset by lower average shares outstanding.
Results of Operations by Segment
The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in Note 20, Segment Information & Geographic Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement in the current year).

(2) AIT Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.

2022 compared to 2021
Total Net sales for AIT increased $79 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of printing products (contributing the majority of the total increase), supplies, and support services. Current year Net sales included the benefit of targeted price increases as well as the negative effects of supply chain bottlenecks, while prior year Net sales benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net sales growth was 6.7%.

Gross margin decreased to 43.0% in the current year compared to 45.8% in the prior year primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, and unfavorable business mix, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.

Operating income decreased 5.8% in the current year compared to the prior year due to lower Gross profit and higher Operating expenses.

(3)EVM Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.

2022 compared to 2021
Total Net sales for EVM increased $69 million or 1.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of data capture products, contributions from our recent acquisitions, and higher sales of support services, which were partially offset by lower sales of mobile computing products and unfavorable foreign currency changes. Current year Net sales included the benefit of targeted price increases as well as the negative impact of supply chain bottlenecks, while prior year Net sales benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, EVM Organic Net sales growth was 1.7%.
Gross margin decreased to 46.4% in the current year compared to 47.2% in the prior year primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, unfavorable business mix, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, and lower support service margins, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.
Operating income for the current year decreased 5.1% compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher Operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions):

Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ (227) $ 152 $ 162 $ (379) $ (10)

2022 vs. 2021
The change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following:

•The decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher inventory levels, current year payments associated with the Settlement, and higher payments of 2021 incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections and accounts receivable factoring activity in the current year in comparison to the prior year.

•Cash used in investing activities was higher than the prior year primarily due to the $881 million acquisition of Matrox, with the prior year including cash payments of $453 million for the acquisitions of Antuit, Fetch, and Adaptive Vision.

•Cash provided by financing activities during the year included $1,037 million in net debt proceeds primarily related to the Company's debt refinancing activities in the second quarter, partially offset by $751 million of common stock repurchases. Cash used in financing activities in the prior year was primarily comprised of $257 million net debt repayments, $57 million of common stock repurchases, and $56 million of net payments related to share-based compensation.

Company Debt
The following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):

-------------------------------- ------------ ----- ---- ---- - ---

Total long-term debt $ 1,809 $ 922

In May 2022, the Company refinanced its long-term credit facilities by entering into its third amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). Amendment No. 3 increased the Company’s borrowing under Term Loan A from $875 million to $1.75 billion and increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Amendment No. 3 also extended the maturities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility to May 25, 2027 and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark reference rate.

33

Table of Contents
Term Loan A
The principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in March 2023 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company may make prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the Term Loan A interest rate was 5.67%. Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.

Revolving Credit Facility
The Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had letters of credit totaling $7 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1,500 million to $1,493 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 5.71%. Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 25, 2027.

Receivables Financing Facilities
The Company has two Receivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $280 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings. The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $180 million and matures on March 19, 2024. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $100 million and matures on May 15, 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $785 million of receivables that were pledged under the two Receivables Financing Facilities. As of December 31, 2022, $254 million had been borrowed, of which $171 million was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2022, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of 5.33%. Interest is paid on these borrowings on a monthly basis.

See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s debt instruments.

Receivables Factoring
The Company currently has two Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash. One arrangement allows for the factoring of up to $25 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region. The second arrangement allows for the factoring of up to €150 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under Accounting Standards Codification 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 there were a total of $61 million and $24 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $130 million and $141 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

See Note 19, Accounts Receivable Factoring in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Share Repurchases
On May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. This authorization augments the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization which was announced on July 30, 2019. The newly authorized share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. The level of the Company’s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 2,027,542 shares of common stock for approximately $751 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 3,323,283 shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the plans of $945 million. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has repurchased 55,811 shares of common stock for approximately $15 million through February 9, 2023.

Future Cash Requirements
We believe that our Cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $105 million as of December 31, 2022, along with anticipated cash generation from operations and available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter based on our current business plans.

Included in the Company’s Cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, which was $36 million and $39 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not expect that Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will need to be repatriated in order to fund the Company’s U.S. operations based on current cash requirements.

Our cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter include payments to satisfy the following obligations:

•Purchase obligations — We have a limited number of multi-year purchase commitments, primarily related to semiconductors and cloud-services, which contain minimum purchase requirements and are non-cancellable. As of December 31, 2022, these commitments were approximately $557 million. This amount excludes routine purchase orders for good and services, as well as amounts already reflected within Accounts payable or Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 14, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

•Debt obligations — We expect to make total payments of approximately $237 million associated with the Company’s debt facilities in 2023. This expected use of cash is based on the Company’s current borrowings and applicable interest rates and margins as of December 31, 2022, and includes principal and interest payments along with expected cash settlements associated with the Company’s interest rate swaps. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may decide to borrow additional amounts or repay principal earlier than contractually owed, which would affect future cash payments. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s debt facilities.

•Leases obligations — We lease certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s fixed lease commitments totaled $243 million, of which $46 million is payable in 2023. See Note 13, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s lease arrangements.

In addition to the expected cash requirements described above, the Company may use cash to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, or repurchase common stock under its share repurchase program. We also expect to spend approximately $75 million to $85 million on capital expenditures in 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The application of these principles requires the use of estimates which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable based upon available information, actual results could differ substantially from those estimates. Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional discussion of these items along with other significant accounting policies of the Company. The accounting estimates described below have been identified by Management as those that are most critical to our financial statements, as they require management to make significant judgments and assumptions about inherently uncertain matters.

Income Taxes
We estimate a provision or benefit for income taxes and amounts to be settled or recovered in several tax jurisdictions globally. Our estimates are complex and involve significant judgments and interpretations of regulations. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for several years after completion of a given year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis, which requires estimation of our ability to generate future taxable income. In particular, our income tax provision or benefit is dependent on our ability to forecast future taxable income in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and other jurisdictions. Significant judgments included in our forecasts include projecting future sales volumes and pricing, costs to manufacture and procure products and to deliver services and solutions, among other factors. There were no significant changes in estimates to our income tax provision during the current year.

Acquisitions
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived intangible assets can be complex and require judgment. We generally value intangible assets using income-based valuation methodologies, such as the excess earnings method, which require critical estimates that include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and the determination of discount rates.

Goodwill Impairment
Goodwill impairment testing consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. Fair value determinations require judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, as well as market factors. We estimate the fair value of reporting units using both income and market-based valuation approaches. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires that we make assumptions and estimates including projections of revenue and income growth rates as well as cash flows; capital investments; competitive and customer trends; appropriate peer group selection; market-based discount rates and other market factors. Our annual quantitative impairment test, most recently completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, continues to indicate that the fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceed their respective carrying values.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods, solutions or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. The consideration that we expect to receive is estimated by reflecting reductions to our transaction price for product returns, rebates, and other incentives. These estimates are developed using the expected value that the Company anticipates receiving and are based on recent trends observed in similar transactions. Additionally, some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, including various hardware, software, and/or services. For such contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the estimated total transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”). The determination of SSP is established at a regional level. SSP is based on observable prices in recent standalone transactions for the same or similar offerings, to the extent available, which is often applicable to tangible products and software licenses. Alternatively, in the absence of recent observable prices, the Company generally applies the expected cost-plus margin approach to professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solution offerings. There were no changes to our estimation processes for consideration received or SSP that materially affected revenues during the year.

Non-GAAP Measures

The Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures – Consolidated Organic Net sales growth, AIT Organic Net sales growth, and EVM Organic Net sales growth – are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented.
